TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

When I resigned, I sent out my email to the company that said I'm good leaving and going to do a company. Danny Luckis, who is also a boomerang, but he had already boomeranged back when I left. He called me as soon as he got that email and said, dude, why are you doing this? You can do more inside of this company than outside of it. And at the time, I was just like, guy, you don't know what you're talking about, but he was totally right. Remember Kushe when I was leaving the first time? He's like, you don't get it, Lauren. Our product, our engineering team is better than anything in the whole world. You don't understand. And I was like, Kushe, eating whatever. And he's like, no, no, you don't get it. You're going to have to figure this out for yourself. And I remember what I came back. And he said, told you so. So I had to learn it all for myself. Right? I had to learn what was special about Palantir by leaving it. I made it roughly six months outside of Palantir. I just got so frustrated with like how a normal company operates. Like why does hierarchy matter? And why does like process for the sake of process matter? And also these people aren't like smart or interesting at all. And so I made it six months. I really missed Palantir. The way that we solve problems, the Pond yourself problems has never changed. Like the way I, you know, it's like a very iterative bottoms up, like, approach to things where we're both like humble and believe that like we don't know shit. But also like we're going to transform whatever company we're working with. There's something about this place that seems to stay like very core to itself and its beliefs and it kind of, and we try different things, you know, every few years we try. And then I used to like get really frustrated with this where like the pendulum was swing from one side and was like, oh, like it's all, you know, like it's all about like PD and stabilizing product. And now we're going to swing back to just like it's all about like Delta's and building with a customer. And then we, you know, swinging it, it's all about like sales. And then it's swinging back. It's all about him. And I used to get really frustrated. And then but now I kind of think, oh, like the swing like all of that is just that it's actually very consistent in some ways where it's part of the experimentation of this place. The reason that people boomerang back is the same as the reason that people leave Palantir after like six months and hate it and never come back. And it's that we don't like we don't follow playbooks. We don't do mentorship. We don't do career progression or anything like that. Everything has to be oriented in first principles thinking. So you are asked as like a 23 year old straight out of college to just like go seem go figure out what seems right to you in the world and then go build it and then test whether that's actually true or not. And nobody tells you how to do it. The interesting combination of like weirdness, humor, like smart anti authoritarian, like all of this interesting combination of like ingredients in people means that like it feels like I've been going my entire life without actually like having close relationships with people until I came to Palantir. And it feels like I was like, oh my god, this is my tribe. The DNA of a company really matters. Palantir has let me be me. I can start my own business within Palantir. How much we're committed to like winning above all else. It's extremely bullish on ontology for making elements actually useful. You know, Carpensham are visionaries. I really believe it. I appreciate the honesty of people at Palantir. I think giggling is really important and Palantir lets you giggle. For people that like know they know and for people that don't know like you'll you'll never understand basically. I don't think there's any other place that can quite compare to this one in terms of like that type of culture. I feel this close connection with being Palantir.
