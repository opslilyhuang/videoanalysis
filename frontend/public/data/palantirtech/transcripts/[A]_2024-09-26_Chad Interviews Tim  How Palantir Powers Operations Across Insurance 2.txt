Hi, I'm Chad Walkwist. I'm an architect here at Palantir. Today, I'm going to have a conversation with a fellow Palantirian. He happens to run our insurance business at the US. So thanks for joining me today Tim. Thanks Chad. Happy to be here. I'd love to hear about your back story about Palantir. I think it's absolutely fascinating from where you've come from to where you've come to. Maybe you'd share a little bit. For sure. Yeah. This kind of idea to say so. Yeah, I did PhD in physics, fun learning off. So I wanted to be an academic theoretical physicist and was in research for a bit. Got a bit frustrated with the kind of a number of things, although I learned a lot, but particularly the kind of lack of direct immediate impact you have on the world. Centuries away from impact there. You are, yeah, for sure. I then moved into doing data science building machine learning models for a number of different clients around the world in different industries, one of which was insurance actually. And then I sort of realized that this was about seven or eight years ago now, that the kind of issue with that was also the kind of the lack of operational impact you see. A lot of the models I was building, I didn't feel like we're really driving any meaningful change for the client sales working for. And then I found out about Palantir, which obviously has a really strong focus on driving real impactful change. And I've been here now for about five or six years and have had a great time. Most people don't understand that Palantir is a bunch of pods in different businesses. Each one of those, essentially the size of a unicorn startup that's out there. And so you're like the CEO of a unicorn startup for the industry AI in insurance space. It's quite cool from a sort of personal growth perspective as well, because you get to kind of, you get to almost have the experience of all of the problems of like how do you kind of motivate and hire people? How do you have the right technology? How do you get clients? How do you keep clients? How do you do how do you deliver an execute? Well, but you have all of the kind of machinery of Palantir behind you. Yeah, we encourage people to grow and accelerate and drive business, not what the goal that you're going to be here forever always. Like it's, hey, this is an ongoing thing. And I think that's just evident seen that we have the highest per capita of employees starting found unicorn startups. I'm really excited about that. I also think I really kind of ideologically believe in like, you know, Palantir obviously believes in having a really positive impact in the world. I really believe in the kind of the value to the world of insurance being better. Like in many ways, like Dr. Karl always talks about the world's getting very risky. I think like the insurances, like the kind of fundamental sort of backstop to make sure that you have the kind of the reserves and the capability to like put the world back together and keep the world running when something goes wrong. And I think it's extremely meaningful for for the whole world if it if insurance like works better, if it works faster, if it works cheaper. I think that impact insurance such as everything. So I think that being better to say something really idealistic. I think that is that I think that really aligns with kind of Palantir's mission to sort of increase the resilience of the world or make the world more sort of risk tolerant. I guess from your perspective, from like our Palantir inside of operation, I seem these workflows. You know, what's your perspective? I guess maybe on the insurance industry because you came in cold and you're like, okay, five years ago, I'm going to learn everything about insurance. What's your perspective on like what you're seeing as far as the insurance industry, especially with the AI kind of boom coming in? I feel like we're at the point of the kind of hype cycle now where maybe some people are actually starting to underestimate the impact of AI. I think it's like it's enormously transformative for insurance. So I think there's two things. So the first one is like just pure kind of operational efficiency. So there's you know, that can be several weeks to actually, you know, you're even months to come up with a quote. And you know, we're putting things into production now that are reducing that time down to less than a day or hours from the time that the insurer receives the documents from the broker to the time they're able to respond with a quote. So that's like an orders of magnitude difference in speed, which is fundamental. I mean, this sounds like, we've got these groups, a group of experts. And now I'm with AI and human team. I'm able to accelerate their throughput. That's actually a really nice segue into the kind of the second thing that you alluded to already, which is like the benefit of the AI being able to provide, you know, reasoning into the process. All of these insurance companies will have underwriting guidelines that are defined by, you know, the chief underwriting officer or some underwriting counsel. And those underwriting guidelines become part of the kind of ontology, the core piece of information that's available to the AI to reason against. So it's you're you're able to say to the AI, you know, not just, you know, not just which businesses this that wants insurance, but does this meet our defined standards for our guidelines for the types of things that we, you know, from a kind of risk and exposure and also like even an ethical perspective, want to underwrite. So you're essentially capturing the first principles that they operate on. And now those principles are made available to AI to help reason across still with humans in the loop. I think that's like so powerful. The interconnection of all those like powered by the ontology, like orchestrated. I think that's that's just so cool. I'm sure there's a lot of our competitors and other companies coming in kind of trying to do this in a similar space. You know, be curious. Are we seeing a lot of kind of failure modes and then they move on? And is that where we're engaging? I guess what are you seeing from the broader landscape as far as people trying to solve this from a technology perspective? There's definitely a price here, right? Because this is like a this is a golden problem. So there's a lot of people going after this problem and there's loads of startups going after this problem. I think you're absolutely right that, you know, specifically in insurance insurance is obviously, you know, highly regulated industry. The information that's coming in in these processes is extremely sensitive insurance companies to get these things to to work properly are going to have to be able to prove to the regulator that these things are, you know, well governed, auditable, transparent, reproducible. They're going to have to have lineage into the information that drove a decision. I'm not a lawyer, but you do have to have to prove all these things to the regulator. So I think that's like a that's a really fundamental kind of reason why people end to go with pounds if for this type of thing in insurance. But also I love the hey, for what is Ford deployed means like we're bringing the product team to the edge building the product that matters to the customer at that point in time. I think that's such a big differentiator for us that like until you see it's hard to believe that we actually have the product team working with a customer on the ground. That's pretty unique. I think it is a pretty it is a pretty like unique approach. It has been incredibly powerful. I think the thing that is really hard for our customers, which is why to go back to when you say earlier the kind of boot camps and things are so important is all of those all of those logos and things in their tech stack and those specifics of where providers everyone is saying now that they are an AI platform. So it is quite hard to like it is actually quite hard for like new customers to actually differentiate like what actually works and what doesn't and I think that's why we that's also the other kind of critical reason for this or for deployed approaches like you know proving it by doing it. So like it's easy to say it's easy to hook up a kind of API goal to GPT and and tend that you are but it's hard to actually be accountable to the outcome and deliver the real like fully orchestrated end to end outcome and that's what we do. Yeah, a safe and secure and scalable way. So all this is like fun. It's awesome and there's some really cool stuff going on. I think like what would you tell someone that's interested in coming and work a pound here? I think that's the thing that keeps me here is that is that I just have the ability to and the freedom but and also the leverage with the product and all the people around me to actually go and like actually truly deliver the outcome. I think the other thing I would say is like which would be motivating to the right type of person and demotivating to the right type of person as well is like it's cool. It's really great to be in an environment where you always feel like the dumbest person. So like I feel like everyone at Pound City is smarter than me I think and I yeah I feel like every meeting I'm in I'm sort of humbled all the time so it's like it's very it's very cool to get to to work with people like that where you're just continually sort of forced to kind of rage your own bar because everyone else is so incredibly impressive. The other obvious truth in which I think is worth saying is that like you it's it's it's it's but it's always been impressive to me at Pound City how much we are willing to kind of push people to the to the front of a problem you know immediately. So like you know if you want to come and if anyone wants to come up I'm sure and so you could you know these these problems you can come and own from from minute one I mean there's no there's no like there's no kind of there's no levels or kind of training plan or kind of stages of hierarchy or titles that you have to move to move and also get access to the cool thing you know once you're here you can do the cool thing from the beginning and that's what that's always been the thing this really impressed me. Well thanks for joining us today and thanks Tim for coming all the way to Arkansas to have the conversation really enjoyed learning all all sorts of stuff about AI and insurance. Yeah I mean no thanks for having me and thanks for giving me the opportunity to come to Arkansas. Now we'll have some barbecue. We will. Yeah.
