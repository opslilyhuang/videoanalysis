TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Thank you for having me today. So I'm AXCUMRAGAMI. I'm a Chief Data Officer of the South Japan Insurance. So my career starts as a researcher in AI, especially in the natural and age processing area, and the rate that runs into the software engineering and doing AI related things over 20 years. So I'm familiar with AI. So I am so excited to hear that AIP is not available on the boundary. So today I'm honored to be here and share our experience. So before diving into the contents, let me introduce the company first. So much of my insurance is the part of a sample holdings group, the feature operates in the various sectors, including the World Wide PNC Insurance, Life Insurance, Elder Care Business, and Digital Business. So the South Japan Insurance handles the PNC Business in Japan, and it is the largest company within the group with 135-year history. So at so much of an insurance, we leverage the boundary extensively, the audition, mega-at-sells, sales branches, underwriting processes, and the crames handling process like the digital response and more. So today I'd like to talk about how have been and will continue innovating our underwriting process. So I would like to explain what the underwriting process in the insurance is. So underwriting in insurance is the process of evaluating the risk of ensuring the person or a set to determine the appropriate premium and conditions. This is a very critical process as it determines the profitability of our business, and whether we can continue providing the good service and peace of mind for all of our customers. So the foundry enables our underwriters to make right decisions based on the key information such as the various resources, such as the internal document, contract terms, and the historical information on accidents. So premium characterisation and simulation can be performed to the consider the various types of scenario. So many simple tasks are already automated, and the underwriters can focus on the process where their expatit has the most impact. So what was the impact? So over the last three years, we have seen the 60 million US dollar improvement in profit, and we expect an additional 100 million US dollar over the next three years due to the three main focuses. The first, we implemented more appropriate pricing based on the date accurate data, supported by a holistic view of the data, various types of data, and logic, the AI working behind the scenes. And the foundry, the sales representative, they can properly explain the reason of the premium, especially for the value is the higher than the last year. The final, there were the huge improvement in efficiency in the underwriting tasks, obtaining the light information at the light time. So now we have the understanding impact. Let's see what this looks like in practice. So here is the demo version of the underwriting application that's including the underdevelopment functions. Underwriting tells review the incoming policy request, which are now automatically pressed into the one of the companies with one rate, into the three patterns, and the process is in the attention, AIB justified prices and approval, rule based approved prices. The key differentiated with AIB is now we can provide the guidance and complex policy request by putting together all the information at the same time. First, the AIB analyzed the older information on new policy request and identified all the relevant underwriting standards, which are all set by the company. Generally, the AIB searched the older composition between the sales representative and the customer, so the previous claims and the industry. To base on this information, the risk cost can be provided to the premium pricing algorithm and the rising suggested minimum premium. So considering all the details of the AIB can provide the suggested action plan. In this case, it suggests the recurrence in more client information and increasing the salesperson suggested premium amount. AIB suggests will not always be correct since that the human in the loop is required. The most important part is that the users to be captured feedback and improve the future responses. Finally, the underwriters can submit their response by providing the justification of the addition and the full details of the policy request and responses and will be written up to the shared with the agency. Okay, so let's conclude my presentation. So as you see in this video, our AI-powered underwriting workflow is enhancing FCNC and the corporations and improved the decision making for both sellers and underwriters. So Foundry and AIP have significantly improved. So the FCNC of our process reduced the manual work and enabled underwriters to focus on the very complex cases. So we are so excited about what we are already being able to do and even more excited for what the future of both. Thank you very much.
