================================================================================

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you in the most sensitive military context to working with oil and gas companies to airlines, to pharmaceutical research, to all aspects of helping to ameliorate the plague that is COVID. There's one trend. Institutions, countries, individuals that can assess the value of software that can work now are the institutions that survive and provide value both in the government, commercial, and even moral context, moral as defined by they increase the legitimacy of institutions. One of the primary issues we have in the West is the dearth of legitimacy of commercial and government institutions, of experts. And this makes it very impossible to navigate issues around how do you rebuild your company internally and externally to conform and thrive in a very difficult context where there's a, there's COVID, rebuilding the supply chain, political volatility, uncertainty, and general skepticism about anything you say. That is a software problem. How do you actually look at the data? Understand that the data is actually true. Understand the veracity of the model. How do you understand, how can you prove to people that their data is not being abused, monetized, used to discriminating against them? Where the people listening to you have a great deal of skepticism. How do people who are on this call presumably trying to evaluate the actual value and meaning of our numbers? It's very hard for them to do, for, to understand this without understanding what is the actual background of the numbers. Are they a forward indicator or a lagging indicator of a macro trend that you've got it right or wrong? One of the interesting things about philosophy, history, and software is that when something becomes crucial to a society, absolutely determinative, it sets off a dialectic of learning so that what we understand about what it means to procure software, use software, integrate into a world that is defined by software is very different than what we would have thought about when it was a luxury product. And that's largely how software has been viewed here and here and here, it's something that can augment your enterprise, your government. It can make your enterprise slightly better than your competitor in a myriad of contexts. It can make your military slightly more efficacious, slightly more transparent or in some contexts less transparent. It can make things more cost effective. But that's not the context we're in now. We're in a context where it is basically binary, institutions and societies which implement software effectively will dramatically outperform. In every context, in the military context, in the clandestine context, in the COVID context, in the context of every commercial entity that we're involved in, and everyone I've ever seen, and everyone you've seen. And then the real questions like, well, what does it mean to survive in a COVID context or how do you stop the next pandemic? In a Western constellation where civil liberties, data protection is crucial. You can't just re-orchestrate the society and re-orchestrate the data without having buy-in from the people that nominally or hopefully completely control the society. Those are software problems. The people who are in charge are going to learn and will learn over time. What does it mean when someone says that software works? What does it mean for software to be implemented effectively? What is the actual alpha? Is the alpha just the output or is it the output also measured against the moral context, the moral imperatives that allow us to unify in a society? Very famous quote from Wichensstein. Anvago Folgen, Sugagalbams, Nishtan Regal, Sifoggen, which means roughly perifized to believe your following a rule isn't a follow a rule. There's this typically used to explain an important trend in language philosophy, but you could also look at this as like to use software, it doesn't mean to actually use software. If software is absolutely determinative of the current condition, just like language wise. It's like in a philosophical sense, you could say we've had a shift from the language imperative or language is actually what determines a meaning to a software context, where it's actually software is determining meaning, value, and legitimacy. Why do commercial government institutions struggle with legitimacy? Because in many cases, it's very hard to understand what is the output, how did it happen under what context? What was paid for it? What did we get? The structures we built are treating software as a cosmetic, augmentive attribute. When in fact software is the language of our time, and mastery of software will determine what works and what doesn't. The numbers that you've seen are a reflection of our bet that this would happen. They are a lagging indicator, and we believe that the transformation, which is happening in the world now, will accelerate, and that the way in which we're providing software, both foundry, gothum, and our ability to scale this through Apollo, will be the way that everyone at some point will actually try to build software, and the way in which institutions will procure software. Because of a dialectic of macro-micro-condition, a dialectic which will force change because the winners will figure this out. On today's call, you'll hear from Alex Carp, founder and chief executive officer, Sean Senkar, chief operating officer, Dave Glazer, chief financial officer, and Kevin Kawasaki, global head of business development. With that, I'll turn it over to Sean. Thank you Rodney. First, I'd like to congratulate the NHS and the UK for a stunningly successful vaccine rollout. The NHS is truly a national treasure. I'd also like to congratulate HHS Protect on winning Gartner's Eye on Innovation Awards for Government in 2020. And finally, I'd like to congratulate US Space Forces Kobayashi-Maru, their cutting-edge software factory for winning the software innovation team and gears of government awards. To 2020 results, 2020 was a seminal year for Palantir. We helped 100 commercial organizations and 10 national governments respond to the COVID crisis. We were able to solve incredibly complex problems in three days and enabled our customers to reinvent themselves amidst these continuous shocks. But of course, that's not just three days. It's 15 years of product development, more than $2 billion on R&D and three days. And for many of those customers, in a short period, we became their default operating system. And we were critical to the core functioning of their operations. In meeting that moment, our business grew significantly in 2020, resulting in 47% revenue growth on a full year. And we created and continue to create substantial opportunities for growth over the next year and beyond. Last week, we announced a groundbreaking partnership with IBM, where IBM will OEM a number of Foundry modules and its cloud pack for data offering, enabling commercial customers to easily build AI-infused applications, leveraging a trusted data foundation and enterprise AI. This partnership dramatically expands our distribution capabilities, leveraging IBM's data in AI's 2,500 sellers. For context, that is a sales force that is larger than all of Palantir, along with an already large install base of cloud pack customers. We were very excited about what this partnership means for our good market in 2021 and beyond. The response since the announcement from prospective customers has been incredibly strong. There's a lot of momentum, a lot of energy. And we will continue to pursue channel partnerships to enhance our distribution. The product driven momentum is clear and building across both segments of our business. We invested in technologies that would help our customers get value fast and create enduring operational value that compounds. Continuously delivered upgrades to our software become upgrades to our customers' businesses. Our Foundry 21 launch represents the culmination of that work. With software-defined data integration, we're automating away the complexity of integrating systems. With a drag and drop interface, frontline business users can build production grade AI-infused applications. Modularity allows customers to take what they need and build on what they have. Archetypes bring point and click use cases to accelerate outcomes. All part of how upgrading our software upgrades their business. As we move into 2021, these innovations are not only helping our customers generate value much faster, they're also allowing us to broaden our good market. We expect to add triple digit headcount to our sales function this year. In our commercial segment, we generated greater than 100% U.S. revenue growth in 2020 on the back of investments in our direct sales force. In the fourth quarter, we signed several large deals with customers across a variety of sectors, including automotive, energy, healthcare, insurance, mining, and shipping. We signed a multi-year enterprise agreement with Rio Tinto in the fourth quarter. This partnership is the culmination of several Foundry deployments integrating data from across Rio Tinto's operations, spanning 90-plus systems, including machines, sensors, and instruments. These initiatives helped Rio Tinto transform borrades into a digital business across the value chain to increase production and enhance profitability and connect people in Rio Tinto's underground operations with data. Foundry will be both a single source of truth, combining operational and transactional data and a digital twin that will enable Rio Tinto's employees to make data-driven decisions and take action from headquarters to the mine face. We signed a multi-year contract with Pacific Gas and Electric to help its streamlined operations across the company. PG&E collects 10 billion data points every day, spanning both structured and unstructured data, which feeds a digital twin of PG&E's network within Foundry to enable root cause analysis and upgrade monitoring. We expect this will allow them to improve their electric operations and asset management, resulting in enhanced safety and grid reliability. PG&E will have a single integrated platform providing a complete operating picture to make fast, effective, data-driven decisions in its public safety power shut-off program, which will help mitigate future wildfire risks. And this is just the beginning of our joint enterprise vision. In addition, we signed a significant expansion with the Fortune 50 healthcare company in the fourth quarter. Across the healthcare industry, there are increasing market pressures ranging from reimbursements that are becoming tied to value-based care, increasing cost of pharmaceuticals, as well as an expanding number of competitors. Managing unit profitability at a granular level becomes much more important in this environment. And this customer was facing the inability to model their complex contract and pricing models in order to make actionable decisions for the negotiations and payments management. This issue is wildly complex, as it involves managing the balance between revenue and cost of good, sold models that are managing the network of suppliers, supply chain, labor, payers, and regulatory coefficients. By integrating these disparate sources into Foundry, the customer now has a contract management solution that automates away this complexity, allowing the company to focus on operational decision-making and outcomes. And this has already led to $50 million of annualized value. We continue to deepen our partnership with BP, and in the fourth quarter, we signed a five-year, nine-figure enterprise renewal. We have worked with BP since 2014. Our software is the backbone of BP's digital twin applications, which has generated over a billion dollars of value in 2020. As part of our ongoing partnership, our software will help BP continue its transformation, as they work towards their net zero ambition. These applications will accelerate BP's initiatives in wind power, electric charging networks, solar power generation, and other initiatives to deliver energy more safely and efficiently for years to come. We are also deepening our work with the Fortune 200 industrial manufacturing customer and our relationship rapidly evolved over the course of 2020 to incorporate several use cases within Foundry. As a manufacturer of personal protective equipment, this customer faced substantial supply and demand shocks into the onset of COVID, accentuating the need to reimagine the firm's supply chain management and order processing practices. After integrating its baseline supply chain performance models in order fulfillment records, the customer was able to move away from its first and first-out order fulfillment and deliver PPE to those who are most in dire need, all in under a couple weeks. The customer is using our software to address enduring challenges, including modeling supply chain scenarios and conducting forecasting and demand sensing to alert users to future bottlenecks and inventory risks. The net result is a decision-making engine at the intersection of a connected supply chain with connected manufacturing. Turning to our government segment, our Gotham 21 launch underscores both our ongoing vision to provide the central operating platform for government, as well as our focus on the near-pure fight in the defense context. We made extraordinary progress on these initiatives in 2020 overall. The full-year government revenue rose 77%, led by ongoing momentum in the U.S., which grew 91%. As tremendous of a year as 2020 was for the government segment, we believe we are just at the tip of the iceberg, and we are well positioned to capture significant new opportunities in 2021 and beyond. Our intensive product investments in developing an end-to-end sensor to shooter and space-to-mud capability are paying off. We are creating unique opportunities to enable the warfighter with AI superiority, and that technology is starting to create large program of record opportunities across the services. Our partnership with the U.S. Army continues to expand. Vantage is a critical asset for the Army to support both readiness and financial management. Vantage helped the Army free of $3.3 billion for reinvestment. In December, the Army exercised its first option year, and we are excited to continue this work with Army Vantage. We recently won a pair of new contracts with the Army to accelerate its modernization efforts. In November, a Pallanture was selected to provide a prototype for the Army's common data fabric and data security solution to support capability set 23. This is yet another opportunity for our software to be used in the mission command space, operating at the intersection of intelligence, mission planning, and execution. It is a true honor to have the opportunity to aid the Army in its efforts to provide an integrated solution that will ultimately improve access to critical data for commanders and soldiers. Deliver efficient use of networks and denied integrated environments. And increase the collaboration with joint and allied partners. In January, we were down-selected to deliver a prototype as part of Army's ground-station modernization and support of the Titan program. Under the $8.5 million phase-1 contract, Pallanture will collaborate with the Army to demonstrate a solution that integrates space, high-out, aerial, and terrestrial sensors for use in intelligence command and control. The overall solution, which carries a total potential contract value of a quarter billion dollars across all phases, will provide operators down-range with short and targeting timelines by incorporating data integration, sensor fusion, and advanced analytic capabilities using AI. We were built for this. Those years of product investments I was just mentioning, that's this. We are looking forward to continuing our work in this area with the Army as well as pursuing similar programs with other services. And while a lot of new 2020 U.S. defense opportunities started as crisis response to COVID, almost all of it is relevant to enduring problems and needs. For example, we started working with the Air Force in May of 2020 to support their COVID response. The engagement has supported COVID-19 testing, PPE availability, helping plan vaccine distribution and personnel availability. And it's also clear to the Air Force how it can scale to fleet availability, combat readiness, and equipment readiness. In the UK, Poundter Software is powering three of the country's most important national priorities, PPE, vaccines, and managing trade post-Brexit. In December, we signed a two-year contract with the NHS worth up to $31 million, where a Foundry will serve as the core platform for secure, reliable, and timely data processing to enable decision makers to efficiently plan and distribute resources, improve patient care, and protect patient privacy. Additionally, the highly successful UK's Vaccines Program ordered, allocated, tracked, and delivered their vaccines in Foundry. While we continue to partner with the world's leading healthcare institutions to combat COVID-19, we close deals that are focused on supporting their ongoing transformation in a post-COVID world. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with the FDA with a three-year, $44 million dollar contract. Our partnership with the FDA began in 2017 to aid the oncology center of excellence and regulatory research across clinical trial data. Our relationship evolved over time to include the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Cedar, which we assisted in the fight against the opioid crisis and supported regulatory review activities. This new agreement will continue our work with the FDA in mission-critical enduring workflows, such as ensuring manufacturers are complying with agency rules and regulations and enhancing drug reviews to speed up time to market while maintaining the highest safety standards. And there is significant opportunity for further expansion, as our work today touches on just two of 16 centers and offices at the FDA. We closed out the year with strong momentum. In the fourth quarter, we signed many significant deals. 21 deals worth 5 million or more, including 12 deals, each worth 10 million or more. In aggregate, we generated 47% annual revenue growth. We saw customer concentration and revenue concentration decrease even as the number of significant deals grew. Our pipeline is substantial and growing. These deals, they start in the acquire phase of our three-phase model and with new customers who are acquired in year that have yet to even join a phase. Both of these groups performed exceptionally, a very positive forward-looking indicator. Additionally, the intensive growth of existing customers continued with average revenue per customer growing 41% to 7.9 million. We grew the number of accounts with 10 million of annual revenue or more by 50%. We're continuing to demonstrate our ability to grow customer relationships at scale as we add ever increasing value to our customer center prices. And it's still very clear that we're just at the beginning. Our customers include only eight of the Fortune 100, 12 of the global 100, and only 24 of the global 300. The opportunity in front of us is immense and growing. And finally, I'd like to thank each and every Hobbit for their exceptional efforts in 2020. You went where you were needed most, from the front lines of the vaccine to the factory floors of PPE manufacturers, from the briefing rooms of prime ministers to the war rooms where the nitty gritty work actually got done. You built the products that met their moment and you did all of this while driving the operational changes and support functions that executed the business. You supported each other through the ongoing trials and tribulations of the pandemic. You are all a constant reminder that not all who wander are lost. I'm proud of what you accomplished and I'm so very honored to call you co-workers. And I'm very grateful and often in disbelief for the joint opportunities that we have for impact. This truly is only the beginning. Thank you. To kick off the discussion on financial results, I'll now pass it off to Carp. There are many insights indeed, some secrets that have powered Palantir and got us from a company that in the beginning, no one would believe would succeed because we were heavily focused on strengthening the West through a near fanatical fixation on data integration and data protection. When we transferred to the commercial world, people didn't believe that would succeed because there's no history of anybody going from government to commercial. When we became a global company, people didn't believe that would succeed because the global typically companies that started in the American government or in America do not succeed or thrive abroad. When we went and did our DPO, people thought we should IPO because that is the best and quickest way to transfer money to Wall Street. But we believe we should be focused on allowing the average person to participate and therefore absorb that risk. Now, as we've had a pretty sublime year based on any conventional metric and as you've seen the results, we want to underscore this relentless focus, what you could call an insight secret, what should be a banality of business, of a long-term focus on the health of what we believe is and will be continued to be one of and will become the most important software business in the world. And to do that, we're providing long-term guidance, pretty radical in the sense that we are committing to keeping a growth threshold of above 30% for the next five years. But not focused on the day-to-day quarter to quarter, near-term focus that quite frankly destroys businesses is one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients, not serving everyday investor and generate suboptimal returns over time because they too are lacking indicator of the suboptimal performance near-term my opicism of running a business. And apparently, obviously, we have rejected this in every way, both from the way we've produced software, from the way we interact with clients from the best we've made that tend to be bets that come to a vision years after a very, very significant investment. In any case, we hope those of you on this call who are current investors stay with us. And those of you who prefer a more short-term focus that you choose companies that are more appropriate for you. Thanks, Carp. All review are fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance followed by our outlook. Full year 2020 revenue was $1,093,000,000 of 47% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was $322,000,000 of 40% year-over-year and roughly $21,000,000 of the high end of our prior guidance range. In addition, for the full year 2020, average revenue per customer was $7.9 million of 41% year-over-year. Average revenue per talk 20% customer was $33,000,000 of 34% year-over-year, with our top 20 customers representing roughly 61% of our total 2020 revenue down from roughly 67% in 2019 as we continue to broaden our revenue and customer base. For the full year 2020, 43% of our revenue was generated from new customers in 2018 or later, exemplifying our improving ability to rapidly onboard customers to our software and realize compounding value as their data assets grow and use cases develop. We see this scaling taking place across our customer base. In 2020, the number of customers generating more than 1 million in revenue annually grew 32% year-over-year. Customers generating more than 5 million annually grew 54% year-over-year and customers generating more than 10 million annually grew 50% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed 21 deals of 5 million or more in total contract value, including 12 deals where 10 million or more. Looking at revenue by segment, government revenue accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing 85% year-over-year to 190 million. We signed several large deals in the quarter, including a 3 year 44 million expansion with the US Food and Drug Administration and a 2 year 31 million agreement with the NHS. In addition, we announced that the US Army executed its first option year with approximately 114 million as part of our partnership on the Army Vantage program. For the full year 2020, government segment revenue grew 77% year-over-year to 610 million and represented roughly 56% of our total revenue. Fourth quarter commercial segment revenue totaled 132 million of 4% year-over-year will full year commercial segment revenue grew 22% year-over-year to 482 million and we continue to see strong momentum in our US commercial business heading into 2021. US commercial revenue rose 107% year-over-year in fiscal 2020, aided by our ongoing investments in our count-based sales force and channel partnerships. In the fourth quarter, we signed several large deals, including a 9 figure renewal with BP, exemplifying our software's enduring impact and value, even in a sector that has been fundamentally challenged as of late. Also in the fourth quarter, we signed eight additional deals with at least 10 million in our commercial segment. Our next discuss are margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which includes stock based compensation. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 84% of 1200 basis points versus the year-go period and full year adjusted gross margin was 81% of 1000 basis points compared with full year 2019. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by increased automation and efficiency in the delivery of our software. Contribution margin was 62% in the fourth quarter, nearly double the contribution margin of 33% in the year-go quarter, which highlights the efficiencies we have generated in customer acquisition and contract execution. According to our operating expenses, total fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses were 186 million, which includes approximately 19 million in employer payroll taxes related to stock base compensation. Excluding these expenses, total fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses would have been 167 million. Fourth quarter operating income, excluding stock base compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was 104 million representing an adjusted operating margin of 32%. The outperformance in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by higher than expected revenue and quarter, continued efficiencies in our go-to market and delivery and maintenance of our software, as well as reductions in cloud hosting costs. Full year 2020 adjusted operating income, which includes stock base compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and non-ecurrent expenses related to our direct listing, was 190 million representing a margin of 17%. As we noted last quarter, we have historically pursued multi-year upfront payments from our customers, which has led to significant growth in contract liabilities in prior periods, such that buildings and cash collections often exceeded revenue. Over the course of 2020, we have moved away from our practice of collecting multiple years of upfront payments, which has led to lower 2020 cash collections and a greater portion of our revenue coming from the recognition of such contract liabilities. We expect this to begin to normalize over the course of 2021, with cash collections and revenue moving more in parallel over time, which will drive positive cash flow from operations for the year. We measure revenue visibility across several metrics. First, we ended 2020 with total deal value across the business of 2.8 billion, while year-end dollar-weighted average contract duration was 3.6 years. This growth rate is particularly strong when considering government customers entered into shorter than usual contracts in 2020 to accelerate procurement as it responded to the COVID crisis, and with quickly unbearable modernization efforts across both defense and civilian agencies. We expect a tail-in for government as these customers renew and expand. Second, our remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 was 597 million, up 124% year-over-year, while current RPO increased 114% year-over-year. Although RPO provides a limited view into our business, as many of our contracts across our government and commercial segments feature termination for convenience clauses, the growth in these metrics is representative of the ongoing momentum we are seeing in our business. Third, we look at annual contract value booked in year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. In 2020, the dollar-weighted annualized contract value we closed increased 49% year-over-year, providing a strong foundation for fueling growth in 2021 and beyond across both our commercial and government segments. Looking at the business through the lens of our three-phase model, we ended the year with strong performance across all three cohorts. Our acquired-based customers ended 2020 generating 77 million in revenue with 17% contribution margin, with nearly half of the revenue from these customers coming in the fourth quarter. This rapid scaling and expanding contribution margin demonstrates the increasing efficiency over customer acquisition and onboarding process, which we believe will help fuel an expanding pipeline into 2021 and beyond. Expand-phase customers continue to see increasing value in their software platforms, yielding consistent upsell and cross-sell opportunities. These customers generated 360 million in revenue for the full year 2020 with the contribution margin of 47%. This represents over 100% year-over-year growth for this customer cohort, and this growth was extremely efficient, as these customers generated contribution margin of negative 43% in fiscal year 2019. Finally, our scale-phase customers continue to demonstrate a strong combination of growth and profitability, as these customers generated 613 million in revenue and 70% contribution margin in 2020, representing 8% year-rear growth and a 1500 basis point expansion in contribution margin, compared with the same customers in fiscal year 2019. In addition, for the full year 2020, we generated 42 million in revenue from new customers we acquired in year, of which 19 million was recognized in the fourth quarter. This compares with 4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, and represents 375% growth year-over-year. You heard from Carp about our long-term orientation. As we move into the future, we believe our investments will help us sustain elevated growth rates for the next five years and beyond, as you pursue a broad range of opportunities across our commercial and government segments. For our five-year outlook, we expect greater than $4 billion in revenue in 2025. During in 2021, we expect greater than 30% annual revenue growth each year for the next five years. In a Q1 of this year, we expect revenue growth of 45% or $332 million at the midpoint, and we expect adjusted operating margin of 23% for the quarter.
