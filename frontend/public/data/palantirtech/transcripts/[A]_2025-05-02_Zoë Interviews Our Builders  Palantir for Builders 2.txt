TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi, I'm Zoe, the engineering lead for the Poundtipa Builders team. The Poundtipa Builders team is focused on working with our engineers, analysts and data scientists at our customers to build end-to-end solutions in the platform. And today, at the DevCon post-game, I'm going to be talking to a few of our builders to see how they're delivering value in the platform. Sam, would you introduce yourself? Hi, I'm Sam. I am a developer at Selkirk Sport. My name is Joe Lighthouser. I am a founder of AppLost Innovation. My name is Michael Bryan. I'm the director of Data Science for Good Night Midstream. Hey, I'm Jack Miller. I'm the CTO at HomeGuard AI. And we've been doing a lot of our building on the Poundtipa platform. Why are you building on Poundtip? Yeah, so it's really interesting. So, my preconceived notion of going into a startup is like, okay, what we're going to do is we're just going to find a problem. There are obviously going to be customers that have that exact problem. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to see that problem. I'm going to talk to no customers. I'm going to go off. I'm just going to code for three months. I'm going to come back out. We're going to get like a million dollars in revenue immediately. And then we're going to go from that. Turns out this is not the case. Actually, you need to spend all of your time doing as finding product market fit. And because we're sort of security compliance, startup, people really really care, obviously, about the security of their data that is coming to us. And so, we needed to find a solution whereby we could spend all of our time thinking about product market fit, thinking about defensibility. And so, actually, Poundtip was the obvious choice because the security primitives are there. It's actually quite easy to build on. And so, we can spend all our time focused on like, what is the customer pain point? Well, with Poundtipa, we're building a whole company on Poundtipa. So, we can deploy our applications in very rapid fashion with AI and automation built into the platform. So, we've built all of our sales apps, our Binance, our HR, everything we build as a company. We built on Poundtipa. It gives us a single data platform for all of our information. We don't have to move data around. And we can leverage that expertise for our clients. Yeah. And we use starting sort of from ground zero and then building in the platform, or did you have to transition from other tools? No, we were a brand new company and we made a decision, a strategic decision, essentially to build our entire company on the platform. We'd wall worked in different companies where you have a sales application, not talking to your finance application, not talking to your project management application. And with Poundtipa and the ontology, we can create a single data platform that runs our entire business. Yeah, that's so sim. And how do you find building on the platform? It's super easy. So, I thought my build days were over. As, you know, I've been leading analytics and governance teams over the last several years and not really into the code very much. I started out with some simple training about a year ago and then started just building on the platform. And now I can create again. I can create software. And I get this question a lot from customers, but how did you learn Poundtipa and sort of ramp up in the software? Getting access to it was the first step. And then once we had access to the software, it's just like a rocket ship. It's intuitive enough to be able to build on your own. If you have a conceptual idea of what you want to do, the data tooling makes it easier to get the information in there. And then the analytics suite and the ontology is intuitive enough to be able to build on your own. And I think basically what happened was like about a month or so into using the platform, there's like a bit of an aha moment where you sort of realize like what's going on. And like what's going on with the ontology, what's going on with like publishing functions and like how things are kind of structured in the internal mind of Poundtip. And so once you've got that, I think actually like you just sort of get it. And now I have sort of an intuition about what's going on on the platform. I think it was a good experience overall. I started with E2E speed runs in the Learn Poundtipa platform. And I thought it was a great experience because it got you in to the platform. It got your hands on the tools. So pipeline builder, foundry overall and then workshops. I was really able to get kind of like a whole view very condensed in those speed runs and get a good idea of what Poundtip was trying to do. Final question is what's your go-to product or application in the platform? Quiver. Quiver. Michael's a Quiver master. I will say that. It is insane. It is like we've used a lot of time series data tools from other companies. It's like Quiver is everything and more. You can just keep going and going and going and going and going and like really fine to an analysis. It blows my mind. I actually think like my go-to application, which is like a bit of an underdog in the platform is Automate. I actually use Automates all the time for like loads of things. I think especially we found actually like one of the primitives that non-technical users like don't quite have access to with like ChargeEBT or other AI tools is like parallelism and the capacity to do things like asynchronously. So Automate provides the capacity to say, okay, they've just uploaded this. Let me then go and like orchestrate 50 model calls with Automate. Do so in this sort of like asynchronous way. Have like all of the side effects, the failure conditions, the retries, all inside of Automate. I think most people how they use Automate in the platform is like, oh send an email. No, no, we're like, we're all concentrating everything through that. But outside of that I'd say OSDK, Agent Studio, Logic and obviously the ontology. Yeah, that's like my big five, the heavy hitters, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Well thank you so much Jack. Thank you so much. It was great. Awesome.
