TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning, everyone. The senator, when he opened this, talked about the importance or the utility of having opposites. So in a practical example of that, here's something completely different. I am not a CIO. I am not a software expert. I am an operator and a user. I have an obscure title for a somewhat obscure organization, but I am going to talk to you about a challenge that we are facing and an opportunity we are using to overcome it, and hopefully engage you in the last question I was asked about culture. That's really what I am mostly here to talk about. So quick agenda, I don't need to go through it. Obviously I need to start with who the heck are we? And so we'll go with that. Obviously I have to take quite a long time to explain what the National Nuclear Security Administration is, but thanks to Christopher Nolan, it's gotten way easier. We are the modern day Manhattan Project. That's the simple explanation for it. But we've evolved over time. So we have three fundamental missions. The first one, as you would expect, is we are the civilian agency responsible for the safe, secure, and reliable nuclear explosive part of the nuclear deterrent. The delivery vehicles, the employment is the Department of Defense. Department of Energy is responsible for the actual warheads. Now any government or any nation that has a strategic nuclear deterrent has an obligation to also have a mission to do nuclear threat reduction, to do non-proliferation, counter-proliferation, to aid in a world that can control the advancement of weapons of mass destruction. And of course we have that activity also. If the President wants to understand what happens when the Russians occupy or bomb a nuclear power plant, they come to us and others, but we have a lot of the technical data. Last part is we are responsible for the nuclear reactor portion of the Navy's nuclear fleet. So the submarines and aircraft carriers. We have a pretty significant underpinning of science technology capabilities. For example, some of you probably know this, but we are recently with the people that achieved nuclear fusion in the laboratory. So we created the Sun and a little BB. That's the kind of things we do in NSA. We are a fairly captured organization. This is it. There are 12 sites, if you include the four that do naval reactors, eight sites that do the nuclear weapons program. That's about 60,000 people. 2,000 of us are federal employees. I'm the senior career civil servant in NSA. Most of our folks are what we call M&O contractors. Just like Oppenheimer came from the University of California, we still have many of our folks who come from the University of California and other corporations, academia, private industry. This is it. The 60,000 of us deliver the strategic nuclear deterrent or it doesn't get delivered. There is nobody else to do it. And that's the way we look at our mission. We are a captured enterprise of dedicated professionals, but we're small, and we have what we believe is an outsized, important mission. So let me tell you what our actual challenge is. If you start with the post-Cold War, and I'm going to, that's for me, is the early 1990s. The Berlin Wall had fallen in our business, a big deal, the president had signed something called the nuclear test band treaty. So we weren't going to do any more underground nuclear explosive testing piece had broken out. So we did the responsible thing to reduce the enterprise of nuclear weapons. We reduced the number of nuclear weapons we have. We reduced the diversity of those systems. We likewise reduced the production and scientific testing capability to underpins that. So we ended up in a situation where when you're going down, there's not a whole lot of time pressure necessarily to do that. So the things we had to do, we could figure out what it took and time wasn't a factor. Back then we had a very stable workforce. People that come to work in that 60,000-person enterprise generally stayed. Forty-year, 50-year employees were not at all uncommon. Third-generation employees weren't uncommon. We had people that could do some of our stuff by sense of smell. It was that level of expertise. As I said, when you're downsizing the deliverables we had to produce. We still had to maintain a safe, secure, reliable stockpile, albeit smaller. And so we really didn't have that many deliverables to do. And if anything, we were kind of oversized to do it. So that defined what our mission was in the early 1990s when we thought the cold war had ended. But here we are now in a time where we're learning something different. We no longer have a lot of time. We are in a race with two near peers and they're modernizing their deterrent very quickly. And we are responding, but technology and time and geoplitical pressure means we now have to get things going faster. Just like everyone, our workforce demographics have changed. A lot of those folks that had 40 years of experience retired, COVID didn't help in that regard. And they're being replaced by really talented folks, but not with the same level of experience. One of our laboratories, Cindy and National Laboratories, tries to measure its effect, not in terms of turnover, but in terms of years of experience. And they're losing, have been in recent years, 8,000 years of experience a year. The other thing is they don't stay that long. We get people, they come for five years, 10 years, they leave and go somewhere else. Now that is not our culture, right? We do not like to hire people, teach them how to make a nuclear weapon, and then have them leave. But that's still the thing we're in. So here's the big thing. I told you that, or one of the biggest things, that the stockpile, both in terms of absolute numbers and diversity, was reduced fairly significantly in the 1990s. We are right now in the process of either producing or designing five new variants of nuclear weapons, right? From one at the most, for all of my career, and I've been doing this for a while, to right now five at the same time. Which is our mission here, by many reasonable measures, NNSA has to do twice as much in the next decade, as we have done in any decade since the 1980s. And there are not that many people left in our enterprise who actually remember how things worked in the 1980s. And by the way, that experience, while it sounds good, the grass was always greener, it's not particularly relevant anymore. So that's our challenge, right? We have to figure out how to significantly increase our efficiency, and effectiveness, and productivity. We've got twice as much to do. There's no way we're going to get twice as much money. We do not have the luxury of time. There are project managers in here, right? You've got cost schedule and scope, you know, pick two. All three of ours have been described for us. So we only have the lever of efficiency and productivity that we have to figure out how to do. That is our grand challenge. Now it says unique challenge. Unique should be in quotes, right? Because everybody thinks they're unique, and you all sit in your seat. Yeah, it's not as unique as you think they are. I'm not going to go through the specifics of all of these things. I'm going to talk about a few things in particular. Those of you who actually read American Prometheus or saw the movie know that part of it has to do with the control of information. Our enterprise is not good at sharing information. It is not in our DNA. For some pretty good reasons. Nonetheless, that's the situation we're in. And I told you that I'm here as a relatively unique use case as an operator. What I actually am. One of my key responsibilities is to be the chief safety regulator for the nuclear weapons complex. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission does not regulate nuclear weapons. We quote, self-regulate, which it works just fine. But that makes us the owner, the customer, and the regulator of this activity all at the same time. So if you think that there was difficulty getting people to share information when it was simply about the culture of stovepipes, when I come to them as the regulator, they really shut down, right? So my challenge is I'm the one coming to the users to say, I need you to be better collaborators when that's kind of odd. Most people would say, hey, they want to collaborate in order to be more effective get their mission done, and they have to figure out some way to manage me. But it's actually in many regards the other way around. Now the last thing I want to talk about, the last item here is about assuring public confidence. So that comes in two different ways. First off, if the United States and our allies and partners do not believe in the credibility of our deterrent, it won't be the underpinning of our national defense and that of our partners and allies that it needs to be, right? So mission success is a national security priority, and people have to know and believe that we can rise to the challenge. The other side of that is that our, if you go all the way back to the Manhattan project, we have not always been particularly good stewards of the environment. There has been some challenges that came along with the Manhattan project in the early days of the Cold War that produced some environmental issues and some safety issues that after the sort of curtain came up, people got more insight into. So another big part of our ability to execute our mission is that we need to have the support and confidence of the communities in which we operate. So we have to make sure we do the mission and we have to make sure we do the mission in a safe, secure, and environmentally friendly way, otherwise we'll lose the freedom we need to operate. So that's the underpinning of the challenge we have and that I face. On button. So not surprising to you all, and NSA is a, and the nuclear security enterprise is a pretty high tech place, right? We have some of the world's fastest supercomputers, arguably like three of the top five. We have certainly some of the best data scientists. But my use case, my challenge that I'm talking about is a little more mundane than that. It's not about that. It's about the day-to-day flow of information and the connectivity of an operational perspective of things. So while these boxes might be true for everybody, I'm looking at it through the lens of a regulator or someone who has to ensure that we can operate safely where the highest consequence failure to operate safety is an inadvertent nuclear detonation and a big hole in West Texas. So really high consequence. So we have to achieve this mission proficiency. Safety professionals are not the highest rung of cache in NSA, right? So we don't turn, we don't get a lot of easy personnel turnover. We have to have a few really dedicated folks who tend to be pretty, pretty old. And so this demographic shift has hit that part of our enterprise particularly hard. And so achieving and sustaining mission proficiency when we have all this experience leaving is a big part of our challenge. Obviously that means what we need to use modern IT to help us. For a lack of a better term, we're trying to come up with a digital twin of a safety inspector. And so how can we use this capability while we have not yet lost those experts to figure out exactly how they do what they do, put it into a format that will allow a energetic, well-educated five years out of college fire protection engineer to do what the person with 40 years of experience did before the person with 40 years of experience leaves or the year after. That's the specialized knowledge transfer. It's not simply what are the standards. They come preloaded with that. They mean they know what national fire protection engineering code says, but they don't know is how to make that actually work in our very unique environment. The other thing we have to figure out how to do is to turn this knowledge into actual information. And I'll get to more of that in a few minutes. But it's one thing to come up with a regulatory position. You can hand that then to the person who the lab or plan operator. It says, OK, here's we think you are or are not meeting safety objectives and you either can or cannot continue to operate this thing. And then they need to figure out what to do with it. But then we have to agree with them because we're the owner that what they're doing about it is responsible thing both from a mission and from a safety perspective. And that's what we have to get to this data-driven decision making. And I'll talk more about that in just a second here. So tonight, I'm meant to be an I-char, don't try and study it. This is a reasonable description of how we currently operate. Stove pipe to organizations in the middle is all those geographic places. They're all run by individual contractors. And we call them partners because our contractors we have for a very long time. University of California is still around from 1942. On the left hand side are all of our individual organizational partners. Somebody asked a question before I mentioned to the folks over here where the government we talk in numbers. So the dollar matters is that these are all our different boxes. The important thing I want to describe here is how safety professionals actually operate. And I've been one for once in my career. They get on an airplane, they fly to a site, they do an inspection, and they walk around the site. Well, no responsible operator is going to allow actual work to go on wireless safety inspectors walking through. So all the, strangely enough, for some reason or another, the work is always paused whenever I'm going through it. So there's that implication. I call it the impact of entertaining people from out of town. But what they do is they have this beat up old version of some CFR in one hand with it's all dog ear and got tabs in it, but they don't ever open it because they know it by heart. And they got their notebook in the other hand. And they just go around and they know what the standard is. But it's an expert-based system to figure out what the reality is compared to the standard. And so each expert is a little bit different. They know what they want to see, which is mostly grounded in the requirements, but there's a lot of interpretation. And they write down what they think is good, and that takes one page, and they write down what they don't think is good, and that takes the rest of the notebook. And then they go back to their office, and they type it all up in a nice report, and they send it back to the organization, and then they go to that, they get on airplane and fly to the next place. That's the way it's been for 30 years. But that system doesn't accumulate knowledge at all. It certainly doesn't accumulate knowledge over time, because a really good operator might remember what was written in the report three years ago, but the report five years ago was lost to time, even if that's the same person from five years ago. And certainly the operators at Los Alamos are head down tail up worrying about Los Alamos, and don't really spend too much time worrying about what's going on at Oak Ridge. So we don't have an integrated capability to understand a broader picture of how we're actually operating. And we do have to understand that we are one event anywhere away from a system failure. It doesn't matter where the event happens. If a bad event happens in Oak Ridge, it's probably going to mean we're going to suspend or at least change or affect operations in Los Alamos and Pantex and everywhere else. So we're a very interdependent enterprise, but because of our history, a very stove-piped way of approaching it, and we don't have yet the full appreciation of what it means to have an integrated capability so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That's a big challenge that we have to overcome. The other thing is it's really hard to sustain continuous improvement. Now I said we need to essentially double our output. Well, there's no epiphany. You all know that. There's no magic thing we can do. The only way to get that is to have a really big effort to make lots of little changes. And in order to sustain a culture shift of lots of little changes, people have to know and understand and appreciate what's going on outside of their relatively small circle. And that's even if there are some of the more forward leaning folks in that organization. So one of the challenges that we have is a term you all have heard and we use it all far too appropriately, but far too often is that we are very risk-averse. Now most particularly the safety professionals I talk about say, well there's nothing wrong with being risk-averse and I agree with them, right? I do not like I'm not into or trying to convince people to increase the likelihood of somebody getting harmed. But there's excessive risk aversion which denies us the opportunities to operate at the efficiency levels we need in order to achieve our mission. And the other thing I'll say is that the risk we are most averse to is criticism, which has nothing to do with the potential of harm to real people. But when you're in a system that lacks a whole bunch of really good foundational data, like broad, I'm not going to say big data because we are not big data, right? I mean this doesn't generate, our little 60,000 person closed enterprise can't generate what would be considered big data and we really don't think there are a whole lot of good analogies in the rest of the world. In fact our non-proliferation folks work hard to prevent there being analogies in the rest of the world. So we have to figure out how to get a situation that allows people to be more agile, to take small well considered risks, but not exceed some threshold that none of you would want us to do, right? So right now our approach up to this point has been sort of asymptotically approach that really slowly. What I like to do is go from an over damped approach to an under damped approach and get closer to the sweet spot faster. But an under damped approach exceeds the threshold, right? You've got to make sure that hump is not too big and that's a really big challenge that we're trying to overcome. So that's where we start from. This is our enterprise, it's been our enterprise for 40 years, it is baked in more than that. And baked into our DNA. Here's what we want to go to, I don't worry about the right hand side. Again, I'm not a data scientist, this is just a general depiction of how we get everybody together, how we share information, how we allow to accumulate. It's the bold words, right? We need to have a data driven and risk informed tool that fundamentally allows us to be faster. You all are in an industry that speed is it, you are either faster, you're gone, right? And I get it, right now the average life expectancy of a corporation in the Fortune 500 is 10 years. So you all live it, right? We've been around for 70 years, there's no way we're going away. We aren't pushed by that, but we have to be. So we have to get to be data driven in risk informed so that we can make reasonable risk decisions quickly and accept the fact that many of them are not going to end up being the right decision. If you're in a big challenge, one of our key leaders said that the best thing you can do if you're faced with a big challenge is make the right decision. The second best thing you can do if you're in a big challenge is to make the wrong decision. But we use the third option, which is to make no decision. And so we have to figure out how to get to the point where we can assimilate the information, understand what our actual projection, what our performance is in a short enough time that the feedback loop allows us to adjust before we actually exceed some threshold of performance level. Well, this big effort to make lots of little changes is fundamentally pretty easy. Do more of the stuff that works and do less of the stuff that doesn't work. But it's really hard for us to step out and take a risk knowing that you're in the baseball hall of fame. If 30% of the time you get a good outcome, we don't see the world that way. The other problem is we don't have big data. We have, I don't think it's, for those of you who are sophisticated, it's a difference between something that's complex and something that's complicated. Our stuff is really complicated because we complicated it. But fundamentally, I don't think it's necessarily all that complex. No. Doing a computer model of an exploding nuclear device? Yeah, that's why they're supercomputers. But operating this enterprise complex, no, complicated, yes, and part of our challenges to figure out how to take that out of it, which means we have to just not know how to get the information, but then how to present it to people in actionable ways. And how to come up with visualizing safety, regulatory information is pretty difficult because it tends to be binary and we need it to be a continuum in order to make better decisions. So it says final thoughts. If you haven't got it from now, it's what I'm really talking about is the challenge we have with culture, with getting an enterprise to pivot to these things. Many of you either in different domains or the way you focus is, I assume, is, hey, you've got lots of good technology and how do you get even more speed? We need to sort of get off a top-dead center. And so this is how my job as the head of operations friend NSA is trying to figure out how to get a reluctant enterprise. To adopt what is a critically necessary capability, and I don't think there's any other analog, right? We can choose from within the capability what tools to use, but fundamentally sharing data, analytics, AI to a certain extent. AI and nuclear weapons is not yet something anybody wants to say in the same sense. But we have to figure out how to do that. So a big part of it is, and in cooperation with Palantir, we have an initiative, it's called SAFER, it's really tortured acronym in order to get it to work out that way. But it's been under work for about six, seven years now. So we got a little bit ahead of this because of that demographics problem. But we still have to figure out how to manage change. Just like the folks before me said, hey, the government's information is the government's information, no matter who it's currently residing with. But getting that information and connecting it is a challenge. And that's in getting people to both be willing to share their information. And then having other folks say access to information is not an invitation to micromanage. So the people that have the information are very, fully fearful that if I'm a contract, I'm the regulated entity. And I share my information with the regulator. They will be better regulators and I will get more negatives. Or they will, at the very least, go from already what we might consider micromanagement to nano management. And they're rightfully very fearful about that. So we have to figure out how on both sides of that entity say, well, this is about performance. If we have better knowledge of performance, then we can get out of this trap wherein where everybody is working in theoretical space. Should we or should we not allow this activity to trying stuff and then measuring whether or not it worked, which is not the space we're currently in. I talked about secure data. It's not so one, it's this who wants to share the bad news with a regulator. None of you do. I get that. I didn't either when I was on that side of the things. The other part of it is we in our business, I'm apologizing if I'm mansplaining here. But everybody knows is familiar with national security information and the rules about that. But we also, we work in a world that's called restricted data, which is a different classification source for our information and it provides complications. So not only do we have this natural challenge, we also have this data thing. We've been investing. We need to keep investing. It's important that in the diffusion of innovation, the money came in early. The outcome is going to be delayed. We all know that, but we have to keep the sustainment. And the big thing is building momentum, which is what, that's my day job. That's why I'm here to talk to you all about to share with you our understanding. And I was going to leave time for questions, but there's four seconds left. So. All right. Thank you all very much.
