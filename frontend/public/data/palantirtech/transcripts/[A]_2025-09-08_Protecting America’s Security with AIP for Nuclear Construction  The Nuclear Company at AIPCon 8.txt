TRANSCRIPT

Please welcome co-founder and CEO at 
the nuclear company, Jonathan Webb. [Music] Just let this sink in for a moment. That 
pink line is the US. That blue line is China. We still have the largest nuclear operating fleet 
in the world. But if you see that trajectory, that's about to change. And it's unacceptable. We're all here talking about AI. There's 
no AI without power. And the most stable power in the world is nuclear power. 
It was invented right here in the US. Our grandparents, our parents, they built stuff in the 60s and 70s that's 
still powering 20% of the country today. In the last 30 years, we built two reactors. 
Those two reactors were just recently finished. They were budgeted at $14 billion. 
They came in at $36 billion. 10,000 people on the construction site working to 
execute that job, managing it with paper. We're the largest economy in the world. We talk about 
innovation and we're giving our frontline teams wagons and wheelbarls of paper. No more. So the 
nuclear company a few years ago formed with the sole purpose in life to deploy nuclear safer, 
higher quality and faster and lower cost than anywhere in the world. We have a lot of companies 
in the US right now designing reactors. Those are all great reactor types. The reactor is not the 
problem. About 20 to 30% of the total project cost of a nuclear power plant is the reactor. 
Legacy designs in the US are incredible. Some of the highest operating performance around 
the world. The new designs coming to market are going to be incredible. The problem is we 
need to be able to deploy those reactors at a scale that's almost unconscionable for this room. 
We have a president that set out a goal to build 300 gigawatts by 2050. That's a goal to keep us 
up with the demand of advanced manufacturing, electrification of everything into this room. AI, 
I just told you two reactors cost $ 36 billion, took 10,000 people on a construction site. How are 
we going to slash that? My client's the frontline worker. Probably got some investors and bored 
watching today. I don't work for you. I work for that man and woman waking up at 3:00 a.m. in 
a construction trailer. And it's our job to give them tools and technology to win. We can't just 
talk about the American spirit and not give our people the technology they need. With Palunteer, 
we're going to do that. And we're doing it in a way that's going to completely shock this world. 
Right here, what you're looking at is mission control. So, the same way you're launching rockets 
into space, we're going to we we're designing a control room where our essentially SEAL team 
six, our best operators are going to be they're going to be managing that project virtually from 
from afar. As we have multiple projects going, we're going to be looking at the the budget, 
productivity, everything is running through that data lake. That data lake is going to have 
LLMs and AI on top of it. My frontline teams, those men and women waking up at 3:00 a.m. in 
a construction trailer are going to be getting predictive analytics. Supply chains delayed 
the night before. We need you to redirect. We have corrective action quality control from 
the day before. We need to redirect teams. Zooming from project from mission control down 
to project. You're zooming in fleets across the country. Now we've got localized construction 
teams. Me and my wife got engaged on the last construction site. It's unacceptable the 
way we're building here in this country. It's unacceptable. We're going to show you 
what a modern construction site looks like. You're going to come into our construction 
trailers. It's going to look like this. Not a bunch of paper on the floor. And we're 
going to take that budget and we're going to slash it in half. We're going to take that 
time. We're going to slash it in half. We're going to take the people from 10,000 down to 
5,000. And we can do this with technology. It's this worker first mentality. My client is the 
frontline employee. How can I reduce the friction from their life? How can I take every piece of 
element that they need to worry about every day away so that they're getting predictive analytics 
in real time? Construction foreman, we're going to have drones with LAR. Welds are off. What might 
have taken 3 weeks to find welds that are off, drone will find it. They're going to let the 
construction foreman know in an earpiece in real time immediately. We're going to take 
teams corrective action. redo those welds. What might have cost tens of millions, if not 
more, in weeks or months in delay can be done in hours. Why are we building stuff like we live 
in 1985? Well, we're not going to traceability, full traceability, full transparency. This nuclear 
industry, all you're going to hear about is everybody blaming the regulator. It's the victim, 
biggest victim Eeyore industry I've ever seen. The regulator is not our problem. We have the safest 
nuclear on planet Earth. You know how many people have died in the US of of nuclear radiation due 
to due to power plants? 0.0 ever. That's because of our regulator. We're going to give them radical 
transparency in real time. All the data we have, let them come in in real time and challenge us 
on how we can get better. Every decision we make, every change we make will be in that data 
repository. the last project that was built down in Georgia, hundreds of thousands of pages of 
documents managing the project with paper. Later this month or next month, uh there's a state here 
in the US that is about to select an awardee to go finish what is going to be about a 20 billion 
nuclear power plant, a site that got abandoned uh and was unable to be completed. The state might 
pick us. So, I hope you know I we've we've shown them our capabilities. In less than two years, 
because of Palunteer, because of this technology, and because of the team I've been able to 
hire to partner with the Palunteer team, we are confident we can give those frontline 
employees not only the tools and that Iron Man suit to go build on time, on budget, but we're 
going to do it in the safest possible way. The stakes are too high. If you're a sports 
fan, we're in the fourth quarter, you know, we're in that that second 
inning or the ninth inning. Our children, that American dream we talk about, 
it's fading. And China is just beating us. They are winning. So to all the tech bros and 
all the big CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, it's time for us to work together, leave our 
ego at the door, be a little bit humbled, and understand that it is possible, but right 
now we have a long hill to climb. We're not only going to build these power plants low cost 
and fast. These these are power plants that are going to last a hundred years. They're going 
to outlive me and my team and my grandkids or kids or your kids are going to be benefiting 
from the work we're doing. Thank you to the Palunteer team for supporting what we're 
doing and and look forward to inviting you all onto our construction site later this 
year, early next year. Thank you. [Music]
