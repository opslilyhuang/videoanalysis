TRANSCRIPT

Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Great to be here. We actually, I start off by saying speed to valley. We've been on a boot camp with the penalty team for two days, and a lot of speed to valley right there, and getting to work with some of the best engineers. And that I've seen personally as well. So I'll start by sharing a story at all, and I don't know if the picture can be put up here. And I can't really see the picture. But that is not a carpe. I think just showing the commitment to a partnership here, Dr. Cobb visited us, and we said, OK, before we take into the tech center or the corporate headquarters, we took into a store, gave him a red vest, and he had a brilliant set of ideas for us to already work on. I think what I want to highlight, that story is, look, I think, we have about close to 1800 stores, pretty intricate supply chain to support those stores, all different types of assortment, that V-cell, because appliances and lumber and nuts and bolts are sold very differently. So one of the first use cases that we picked up in this relationship has been going on for about a year now, was really around our supply chain optimization and inventory optimization. It's been a problem that we've been trying to solve for a period of time. And I'll tell you, I think we talk about January the way I, but sometimes we lose the focus on the foundation. We've been trying to solve that data problem for a long period of time. And I can tell you, when we got Palantir and the engineers that came in to support us, we were able to get our base data onto the foundry and the ontology layer in about three weeks. And we started to get our business teams on and starting to action on it. That's the speed to value that it created for us. And honestly, from there on, there is no shortage of use cases coming from all different parts of the organization to kind of build control tasks. Not a mention now, but we're now playing around with AIP platform to build a chat experience, a conversation experience to really interact with that. And how do you kind of create for the value of make it simpler for our end users or associates? Right? So that's one part of the story. The second part of it is I think what also adds beyond the power of the platform. The other part that I do want to kind of talk about is all of the forward deployed engineers as I call it was a new concept for us in terms of engineers working with us. Typically, we get a lot of sales folks from software in companies working with us. So it was actually refreshing, good to have the engineers to kind of work with our engineers. We tend to say even though we are a retail company, we are a very engineering centric as a tech organization. That was one of the common connecting points when Dr. Carp visited and the reason why we are here for the bootcamp as well. I think the engineers that came into support really helped amplify what we do and create that speed to value. So just one highlight how the power of the platform and the power of the engineering kind of the engineering to engineering collaboration can create that value for us. So, could us all the engineers here, a fantastic set of engineers here that I met all through the day of the last two days. Lastly on January way I think it kind of gets everybody to the starting lane. That's the other advantage that I see as to why we selected Palantin as a platform because everybody is back on the starting part of the track. And I do truly believe Palantin can help us kind of accelerate the way there and we appreciate the partnership. Thank you. Thank you.
