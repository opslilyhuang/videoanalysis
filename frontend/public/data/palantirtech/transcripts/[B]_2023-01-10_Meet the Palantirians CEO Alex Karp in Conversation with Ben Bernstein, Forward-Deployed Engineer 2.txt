TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We're ready? Yep, yes. Okay, so who are you? What do you do? When did you join? My name is Ben Bernstein. I'm a Ford Deployed Engineer and I joined about four months ago. Where'd you go to school? I went to university in Pennsylvania. Where'd you grow up? Right outside Philadelphia. And I ran into you the other day, the reason why you're on this video is I asked you what surprised you the most in joining parents here? What surprised you the most besides that you're on video now and you're about to be famous? That was a little bit surprising. The biggest thing that surprised me I think was the lack of really true hierarchy at the company and they sort of mentioned it a little bit in the interviews but it's hard to get to say it's true hierarchy. What kind of hierarchy you mean and what kind of you had which true hierarchy. It sounds like true. Yeah. In a previous job I had a direct boss. We don't have to mention the name but like what kind of company and like what kind how did the boss like was it? How was it different than this? Yeah, it was nominally I'm your boss. Right. It was a product design consulting company. I had a person who was directly in charge of exactly what I was doing every day and who sort of made decisions about how well I did and gave me direct feedback and updates. And you know at the end of the day was the person who was doing my reviews at the end of the year and things like that. And I had a very specific reporting structure of this person got their feedback from someone above them and someone above them and so forth and that trickled down very directly. Because here from what I've noticed is there's a lot of ad hoc control and authority that just comes up to who's actually doing the work and who's actually involved and who's closest to the matter at hand and that I think gives a lot more. I mean my caricature of this is in a normal organization you have a chain of command where sometimes certainly from a technical perspective the delta between what you'd want to build and what you're being asked to build to build is fairly wide and there's no way to get the iteration of what you should build back to the top since it all goes down. There's no upward function. And authority is derived purely from the role and therefore the compensation but it pound here mostly the authorities derived from who is the subject matter expert on this technical problem. And maybe also even who has the most experience within the problem itself and with the client and who's the end user because they have the best sense of what the end user actually is. What technical challenge are you working on now? Right now I'm working on data harmonization for one of our clients dealing with lots of internal data that they generate on their own and external data that they're pulling into. Why is that a difficult problem? It's difficult because they have to deal with different data sets that all have different levels of data quality. So a lot of the information that they get in from outside sources is dirty at best and sometimes it changes day to day and they need to be able to handle all of those challenges and pull everything together to get a full view of their entire operation. Here you go. See the pike lining and pound here foundry and ontology. Nice to have you here. Thank you. Take care.
