TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The Scudoria Ferrari Formula 1 team faces a constant challenge to see car, driver and data all performing as one. It has a very, very important role in Formula 1. The sensors are very important for us because we can make decisions based on what we are measuring and reading from the car. It's difficult to figure out how many data are flowing by only two single car, no? But you have to imagine that we run in different tracks, for different sessions, in different years. So we also have that data to fit and to correlate. We have simulation. So it's very important for us to have some tools that organize all these data. We have a lot of different data that have to be put together in order to extract the valuable information. It's hard to have a tool that is able to go as fast as your mind goes, a tool that allows us to take decisions and being able to navigate through an intricate network of data and different information. In a word where you have to take decisions in minutes or sometimes even seconds, reaction time and adaptability makes all the difference. And when it comes to data, the greatest possibility of my team is of course to analyze the data we collect and also to build models and tools. The parent-yff platform helps us bringing all of our data together, allowing us to focus on the analysis of the data, finding patterns and extract value from it. If we are well correlated, it means that we better understand how the difference performance factors play together, which means that we've run shorter experiments and those have quicker design iterations within the constraint time that we have available. Palantir's foundry platform makes it faster and easier for ScrooDariaFarry to access, analyze and make decisions from sensor data. Quickly organizing time series data in an intuitive, actionable way is a challenge, but that's where Palantir's powerful data model comes into play. ScrooDariaFarry is all about partnership between drivers and fans, between the car and the team, and between data and performance. Palantir's software makes life easier for ScrooDariaFarry because their key issue is being able to do things quickly. They have limited time to integrate huge sets of sensor data, run analyses and make fast, accurate decisions. The speed and accuracy of those decisions is what helps to increase performance, brutal liability and ultimately deliver more wins. Time to value with the Palantir platform, as users like ScrooDariaFarry discover, is almost immediate. The software abstracts away the data integration and gives quick easy access to massive amounts of data, on which you can run flexible, iterous analyses. And importantly, with or without having to write code. Working with Palantir changed the perspective of which we approach data analysis mainly because what previously could have been done in hours of calculation now can be done in a very short time. One of its core strengths is the ability to process vast amounts of data in a new little time. And so it's very easy for us to take decision based on lots of data and to interpret them quickly. ScrooDariaFarry's Formula One car must stay on the racetrack, but Palantir technology works everywhere. As many organisations that rely on time series data to make key business and operational decisions are now discovering for themselves. ScrooDariaFarry and Palantir, partners in ultimate performance.
