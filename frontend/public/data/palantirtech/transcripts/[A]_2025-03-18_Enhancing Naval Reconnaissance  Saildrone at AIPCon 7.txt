Okay, thank you for being here. I'm excited. I'm going to try and walk through 25 years of my life in the next five minutes. I'm going to get going. The journey started in London back in 1999. I was at University of Silicon County Engineering. I set out to break the wind powered land speed record. I thought it was going to be easy. It was really hard. It was 10 years to solve that problem. It was a solid effort where I designed, built, drove all the vehicles myself. I built five different vehicles in five different countries and the record in 2009 in Nevada. I set the record of 126 miles per hour. The secret source was using an aerodynamic tail to control the wind. This provided a consistent thrust while consuming no power and creating a little drag. It was this wing system that evolved for the Seldron project. Our centre record, I moved to Alameda, California in Barton building, Seldron. We started small in the Torddrains all over the world. Some of the hardest parts of the planet. From the Arctic to Southern Ocean, even through hurricanes. At 18, I set up a Atlantic. It was well aware that the ocean was a fast and often unfriendly place. Our main systems were going to be the future. With misindurance of this up to a full year, Seldron provides extreme utility for many roles and basic domain awareness to complex military applications. Data is given in real time by satellite. Our larger vehicles carry engines and generators, large fuel tanks to increase speed, range and payload capability. The 65 foot surveyor is optimized for deep ocean mapping, creating detailed maps to sea floor down to 11,000 meters. Being completely silent platform, Seldron also excels at much more complex applications like anti-summer in warfare and subsurface intelligence. Seldron is the only continuously deployed USB on the planet. This is the fourth year of continuous, consecutive operations of the US Navy. We face extremely urgent threats in the maritime domain, both at home and further afield. As we secure our land borders, we'll push our narcotics smuggling to the maritime border. China is militarizing a vast illegal fishing fleet, threatening our physical and global food security. The PLA Navy is greatly outpacing US shipbuilding. We cannot compete with China on shipbuilding alone. Seldron's mission is to lose solutions at scale to counter these threats today. Our 10 years of R&D, almost 2 million North Kumar sailed, Seldron is a highly evolved solution. However, after almost 50,000 days to put it sea, we still learn new lessons every single day in federally valuable lessons, lessons that money just can't buy. Over 10 years, Seldron has amassed the world's largest data collection of service-based maritime intelligence data on which we train on machine learning models. Seldron is a truck. It's a sense of a truck, combined with the models that deliver tactical intelligence. However, we're at a scaling bottleneck. We need systems that can scale as we grow. Firstly, we're deploying warp speed to our supply chain and manufacturing. As we transition, we're making hundreds to make thousands of old manual data processes break. We need sophisticated systems that can correctly order, store, and assemble the hundreds of thousands of items that go through our facility on a regular basis. Secondly, we'll apply AI to our enormous data set, even with our sophisticated onboard machine learning models that only send back what is absolutely required and important, we still deliver a huge amount of information back to shore, far too much for the human eye to monitor and digest. Using volunteers AI solutions to monitor real-time data feeds from the fleet will transform our intelligence products. So this is an example of using volunteer tools to radically evolve a manual workflow using AI agents. This screen brings together all the intelligence into a single pane of glass, saving countless hours normally spent on data coalition. Despite having many thousands of very targets during this time in the Bay Area, the agent is only displaying targets to the information that is believed relevant for the selected case, which is a suspected drug shipment. On the right side, I can see how the agent is prioritising different matters for the human agent to review. This screen shows the AI process from receiving war images, send data, completing sensor fusion, and constructing risk assessments for each scenario. However, it's not a black box. We can actually click into any agent to see its exact thought process and how it reaches a specific conclusion. Where the agent isn't confident, it also asks human for interaction and direction. Next, clicking back to the internet itself, a human can now review all the data the AI coalesced to confirm this reasoning. In this case, the agent has pulled out all the textions of a boat that are geotemporally located, aligned with criminality known on shore. The agent is requesting retasking of the drones. Let's take a closer look. In this case, we don't want the cell drone to be stationed next to traffic area in the port, so we draw a box and the agent is now rerouting that waypoint. Finally, we can seamlessly deploy task instructions to the entire fleet with a single click of a button. While this is just a small example of a small data set in the Bay Area, I'm sure you'll appreciate the phenomenal possibilities when you match our enormous data sets with this powerful technology. Time is upon us. Nricotics, migration, illegal fishing, and aggressive foreign nations threaten us today. We can't wait for promises of tomorrow's technology or for a shipbuilding revolution. Cell drone stands ready to scale now with a proven AI-enabled hybrid fleet of the future. Cell drone and Palantir bringing the future of maritime AI. Thank you.
