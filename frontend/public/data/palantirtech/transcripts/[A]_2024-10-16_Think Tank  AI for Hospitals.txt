TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

A lot of the work we've done, whether it's like determining eligibility for hospital at home at Mount Sinai or some of the work we're doing with with Tampa, John, or on Texas, it really boils down to like understanding these pretty complex sets of rules across the healthcare system and then transforming those into a way that can be evaluated against the like unstructured and semi-structured patient data to say, okay, this patient meets this particular eligibility for hospital at home or concern for sepsis or K-truda from a reimbursement perspective on the back end. And there's a real like heterogeneity problem in healthcare where you can't represent every possible combination of circumstances in one discrete field in the EMR. That's when large language models in the EMR become very useful where like a little bit of machine reasoning goes a long way to avoid the need to codify each individual node within the health system. And I think like creating this like immense amount of like structure and like the network connecting the guideline to the particular part of the chart that's used to trigger the guideline is the thing that allows us to like operationalize these large language models and historically the medical record has had a monopoly at the point of care and it's like almost like like heresy to suggest any other software should be involved. But I think as we move forward and as we like understand like how we can you know deploy AI into reimagining some of these workflows, I think you know could you at the same time have the clinical evaluation which we showed in that like K-truda example right next to the billing example and it's getting very specific about the work that needs to get done based on not just like the intuition of each of each physician but the actual empirical research that has been done to understand how we should treat these patients and closing the loop on the empirical research is tremendously difficult like even for academic institutions that produce the research like they can't operationalize to close the loop on the research. I'm coming on the last concept which is this is why patients and trials do better because they actually get what they're supposed to get and so this is one thing from a care delivery perspective which change outcomes across a broad spectrum of patients because we'd be applying or at least helping the clinician to apply properly the standards that have been built in trials so it would be truly interesting to do something. The industry more broadly so that if you're getting care and you know some of rural area versus an urban area around like a Mayo Clinic versus not that doesn't have to impact your you know your outcomes in the way that it does today. So how you know you have to start thinking about what is going to drive us as a society because this is beyond the hospital's now right what's the society going to ask us to do to improve care? That's what I was going to say I think the ontology could definitely factor in the social determinants of health right when you start looking at the patients H&P and then that factors into their care. That's what we love about how about our work with our materials there or whether that means guidelines have to be fed and or just things change in your system and you're able to pivot as we've seen in so much of our work we've done. As we worked with them over time this shift was to the expectation we will be going to do this because we're saving lives and now we're able to put those most common things that cause people to delay entering the pathway and we can start you know iterating on that. And now we're a consortium that can go back to the insurers and say well this is what we're seeing from the best outcome. Yeah I would love to see this as a way to take back some about power because we're the ones that are booths on the ground to use today's theme not the insurers and are them. And you brought up rural health care book more earlier and that's life changing that would be amazing. It would change the fabric and society. You
