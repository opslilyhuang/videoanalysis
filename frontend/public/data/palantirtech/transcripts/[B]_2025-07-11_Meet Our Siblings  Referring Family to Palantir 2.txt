TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Our parents are testing us right now as suggestions of what to say on this video. I said, Mom and Dad, what's different about us? My dad just responds a lot. That was an awful thing about that on the way down. I guess that's part of the seven video idea. I was the weird kid back in Germany and school. I definitely always looked like a kid. We're focused on different things than other people. We just like are more free spirits in the sense of like we're just like chaotic dynamic, trying to just get things done sometimes. Explore things like other people. Explore things that they can't explore. I graduated West Point in 2008 and you were 12. I went to West Point and graduated in 2012. That's where our parents met. So a lot of connections there. We ended up at the same post and then from there we actually ended up in the same unit. We deployed to Afghanistan together, all that sort of stuff. I think in high school we sort of deviated what we wanted to do. When we went to college we both kind of went our own ways and our majors and things like that. He did astrophysics in high school. He published. He was a lead off of a paper that was published on NASA's website. We deviated and we deviated. He was an Olympic fencer. I guess we were just like inseparable up until college and then we kind of forked in, or I lived in California for a while. I lived in Austin. So we're excited to be living together and working together, a volunteer. It would be good to get the tool back together. Ooh, do you want to take this one or do you want me to tell you? You're more interesting. I bet you did for it. Okay. I studied computer science, data science, jazz guitar, three majors and a minor in business. I was yanked all over the place because I was either hitting the books in the library, playing gigs, teaching. We come from a family of math teachers by like three generations at this point. Everyone's starting at its own point. Like we've all been math through to its own point to another. We grew up in an environment where the news is like literally always on in our household. We're a very like, talkative household in that way. We talk about politics. We talk about the world. You know, there's sort of like software engineers at other companies. Like, it's not a requirement that you like, you know, think deeply about like the world around you and how it's operating. Like it's very easy to be tunnel vision on your code. And I think we just simply could not have done a role like that and like been happy. My first week at Palantir, I run into Dr. Carb and he introduces me to someone and he says, Ethan, I think that you'll disagree with this person. And that was when I realized, you know, I really like this place. A company that not only stands up for their values, but goes out of their way to introduce people that they may disagree, that was very cool. Monday of my in-doc week, we had Dr. Carb AMA and a sham AMA in person in New York. And especially at the in-person one in New York with sham, I just seeing like everyone come and just ask the tough questions about why are we working with these people? Why do we determine that this is what we want to do? I think it really just opened my eyes to, oh my god, like there really is no hierarchy. It's hard to believe until you're in it because everyone says we're different. Everyone says, yeah, it's meritocratic and the more you do, the more you get involved. But this is the only place that I've seen that. What I think is surprising, scary but also very exciting is like people here have the ambition and I almost want to say the delusion to say we can solve any problem. And the more surprising thing that gets me every time is like wow, in a lot of cases we actually end up doing it. I feel like things that I'd maybe be punished for elsewhere, like passion or just like insane intensity I was rewarded for here and just felt from the beginning like it was a natural fit and like amplified all the characteristics that I took pride in myself but maybe weren't maybe to wield them as freely as I do here. Yeah, I feel like my brain's kind of been rewired in a good way just working here just. I feel like I'm just surrounded by just the equivalent in the workforce here of just elite level athletes. The ethos that exists within like those who serve and where they uniform is like met and matched by what's experienced here. I'm sure if you were to walk in to the back cave this weekend, you wouldn't, you wouldn't see an empty seat. And these are like young, extremely talented engineers and teammates that can be anywhere, they can do anything. But they choose to sit in a windowless basement. And it's a big deal. It's a big deal. And do that. Yeah, it comes with a door dash account. The mission is like the most important thing. Like honestly, like what else are you going to be doing with an engineering degree? You're going to be like building ad tech or you're going to be building things that matter. Like the most important things to you. You know what? One of my favorite things that like since I've joined is like getting a call from a close friend that's still in and he's like, I'm using your stuff in a room every day. Like this is awesome. You know, and like this is like, yeah, that's like why you do it. You're like, I'm helping somebody that's like still doing the job, which is really, really cool. Being in an environment with people that like care and don't necessarily treat it just like another job, but are like, I want to like make an impact. I want to make a difference. They want to make it real. And they want to make it real. They want to make it happen. And then I think you're just enabled to actually have a significant impact in an incredible time frame as well through the tools and all the frame work. And the people in the organization. And all the people in the organizational structure. Like if you need to, if you need to have something built that's super high priority, you can scrap together a group and you can get it. Just ping anyone on Slack if you need something. We don't have titles. Rolls are super undefined on any given team or any given project. And that basically means that you have to like look at the problem space ahead of you and be like, okay, here's all the stuff we have to do to solve the problem. And like we're just going to do it as opposed to like, here's your job. Here's my job. Like here's where my capabilities kind of like start and stop that kind of thing. It's much more chaotic. You're having a conversation with my CEO just yesterday. A part of the workload that I'm owning that I'm building. And I asked her for some advice and she was like, I have no visibility into that. But if you think that's best, go for it. And this is something that we're pitching. We're demoing. We're actively giving to users. And really I've been here five weeks, you know, four weeks on impulse. So it really does feel like I do get to own the things that I work on. Is there any other company where you would be like leading as much of the work in like two and a half years in or a me a year and a half in? It really don't think so. Yes, the younger sibling or like as the newer sibling when you come in, there is that side of like a chip on your shoulder like a crap. This person has actually been successful. This one has done this well. What if people are comparing me to it? What if? And like the more I'm here and the more I see like other siblings doing, the more I realize like it's a worry that should not exist. Everyone is so different and people spikes come through so much through the job.
