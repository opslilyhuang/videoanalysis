TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Thank you, Julie. And I'm going to be brief. I'm here really to do the welcome. I opened the first brew pub in Colorado. It was my real claim to fame. And then at the age of 50, I ran for mayor of Denver on the premise that the government should work for the people, for the small businesses. And I felt that too many decisions were made with re-election in mind. And I was just running to make points. And somehow I wanted a landslide. And I did that for eight years and worked to get the region to work together. And then I ran for governor. And I won that, not maybe not a landslide. But I had no business being in politics because I wasn't trained in it. But it did mean that I could bring a different perspective. And when I ran for the Senate, I wanted to take the lessons of what it's like to be in the mayor's office and in the governor's office and deal with legislation that comes from Washington. And it's funny, I got a great sense of the pitfalls that happened, the unintended consequences that come from over regulation. And when we first came in in the governor's office, we did a statewide bottom-up economic development plan. We went to all 64 counties, asked them, what did they see in their future for 25 years from then? And then they did jobs, what kind of industry did they want 25 years later? And then how could the state government help them? And we heard again and again, less red tape, less bureaucracy, better trained workforce, more access to capital, the normal things you would expect. And that's really what we did. My eight years as mayor, eight years as governor, we wanted to make Colorado a beacon for innovation and new ideas and technology. And the way we did that is we really made every capital investment, or almost every capital investment, based on what would a 32-year-old young professional, what would attract them? We wanted to be a catnip for the young generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. And it kind of worked. I mean, we now have 1,000 miles of bike trails in Metro Denver. We, you know, Red Rocks, some of you have been in Red Rocks, which is one of the most beautiful natural amphitheaters. It used to do 40 concerts a year now, it does 200 concerts a year. We have more brew pubs per capita than anywhere. But part of this also has allowed me to watch this transformation, this taking place right in front of our eyes, where we know that there's a new era of technology coming forward, AI, eventually quantum computing. But that transformation is coming with a whole new generation of young people that are rising up and haven't grown up with the same blinders on that I grew up on. You know, I'm a baby boomer, so I grew up, we were going to change the world. I marched in Washington, and we went to the Civil Rights protests. And for all the failures of my generation, the world's a different place than it was when we came in. This next generation, I think, is going to take us to a whole new level. And what I say all the time is, as vigilant as we have to be, these are dangerous times, very, very dangerous times, we should be very excited. And AI is a perfect case in point. You know, Aluskarth, the CEO of Palantir, was part of the panoply, the forum that Senate leader Chuck Schumer put together last week. He talked a little bit about national security and how the right technology, the right software can dramatically change the success of our national security, our military establishments, our intelligence community. That's true in every part of government. Right now, the internal revenue service, the IRS, the tax collectors are rebooting their whole culture, and we need to make sure that they get the right software. Because for too long, for government, they've always put making sure they keep everyone on the payroll when they're downturns and funding. They don't want to lay anyone off, or people take, you know, when I came in as mayor, we had a terrible budget crisis, and we had to, and this was tough, but every other week the people would take Friday afternoon's unpaid off. For people that are trying to make their rent, that was very difficult. Now, they got used to taking that long weekend pretty quickly. But we have to recognize that historically, city government, state government, and the federal government have favored maintaining their employee base and their infrastructure above their investments in technology. So if you look around the federal government, as I've done now for the last two years, I've been in the Senate, it's a mess. It's one band-aid after another in almost every agency. And yet when we see what good technology can do, it becomes transformational. And people are anxious about this, this notion of AI, that this machine learning that can get onto a loop and continue improving and move at lightning speeds is somehow going to, people are going to lose their jobs. That's not true. At the forum, the Chuck Schumer put together, a couple people noted how AI is going to provide the tools so that many, many more people can participate in the creation of software and the solution of problems. And that's a staggering thought. The number that was put forward last week, that right now, today, on this earth, there are about 100 million people that are part of creating software. But the 10 years from now, there'll be a billion. And that's probably an understatement. So the ecosystem in which software's created is going to change dramatically. It's going to cure things, it's going to find vaccines and cures for health issues that we've suffered from for centuries. And it's going to do it and make it look easy. It's going to allow us to look and improve all kinds of systems of getting clean water and making sure we grow our crops more wisely. But it's also going to create risk. And our adversaries are going to be right up there competing to figure out how to do war making with AI and put our country risk and in doing so, make their country risk. So there's obviously tremendous benefit and there should be tremendous excitement. But we've got to be vigilant and we've got to have a sense of urgency. And as I started off saying, government makes too often too much regulation. But we know that we need transparency. We know that people have to be able to trust AI. That's part of what you guys are all going to be working on today as you look at this. How do we think about government and technology in such a way that we really do have a transformational change? So I unfortunately have to go back to Senate and let deal with a lot of things that aren't going to be anywhere near as exciting as what you are. I'll leave you with a story when I first ran for mayor and I didn't have a chance everyone laughed at the idea that a bar owner would be there. And I had these young volunteers and they'd get frustrated because we always were 2% or 3% of the polls for the first couple of months. And I tell a story about an article I read in the Denver Post about a professor in Wyoming, a professor of public speaking teaching her class why it was important to use opposites in public speaking. If you talk about the worst of times, you talk about the best of times. If you talk about the agony, you talk about the ecstasy. And she asks her class is what's the opposite of despair? And the kid raised her head goes joy. She goes exactly what people feel despair. Use joy in the same sentence, both words gain emotional impact by being together. And then she said what's the opposite of what's the opposite of whoa? And the kid way in the back goes, give it up. And I leave you with that because right now the opposite of whoa, it's work a little hard the opposite of whoa is to get it up. Thank you.
