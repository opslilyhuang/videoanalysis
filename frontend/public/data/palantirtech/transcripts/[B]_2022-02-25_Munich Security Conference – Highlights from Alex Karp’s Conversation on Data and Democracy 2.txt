TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

What the West needs to do to win these things is to raise the standard of competence so high that you have both moral and technological superiority. And then the question you always get is, well, how do you do that? So in software, and I can't speak to other industries, software is a magical business which has certain ethical challenges because the magic can only be done by very few people and they end up with all the money. So that's a real issue for our societies that has to be dealt with in my view through some form of redistribution. But the one thing that's a caveat is Europe is weak in software. So if you're going to do this for cars and chemicals and clothes and everything else, you got to do it for software. And so that's something that has to be, and by the way, now's the moment to do it because there's a very strong working relationship between Europe and America and this will be co-beneficial. But Germany, by the way, is uniquely positioned to push this because, well, there's the financial reason which is it's absolutely in the interest of every German because how does Germany, Germany's an export country? It relies on open markets. Without open markets, Germany's economy will not work. Everybody in business knows that here. And to have open economies, you're going to have to have standards because the parties that you're shipping to don't like each other. And then, but Germany is uniquely positioned as a of the large countries. It's the only one that's plausibly neutral. And everyone associates Germany with a high level of competence and certain kinds of rigor. And not this is just the cultural association. Like Germany has a very positive reputation globally. Realistic, everyone knows German history. But I would say outside of Germany, the Germans and the diaspora are more positive about Germany than inside Germany. And as you know, as a Bolschauflow, it's like an amazing asset. In when you're negotiating complicated treaties, you got to find a standard that both people can live with by which is a standard. And by the way, maybe Germany is the best of software tomorrow and that's different. I do think Germany or Europe has laid out a lot of ideas about data protection which, in my view, or by the way, the ideas we conceived of in our product 20 years ago. So I happen to share these ideas. What are those ideas? Who does the data belong to under what conditions? What is the province of the data? Where is the data processed? Who has legal rights to the province of that data? Is it Germany or is it Palo Alto? Is it the US authorities because it gets processed in Palo Alto or is it the European authorities? Is there a distinction between data and processing? How do you prove the security model? Can that be proofs in a transparent way? How long does the data get held? One of the things that American civil libertarians prefer is that you can't get rid of the data because if you can get rid of the data, then maybe you could do weird things on the data and purge it. Germany in general, Europe sees that differently. They want you to purge the data because they want to have a personal life. I'm much more on the European side here personally and our product allows you to do those things which is why it's been very successful in Europe. So I do think Germany, Europe, does have a very unique way of conceiving the policy. And yes, we will all have to live with those things. But there is just, you could say, one of my, it's not exactly related, but one of my favorite quotes from victimist, a regal of Fogosugga, Almus, Nistana, regos of Fogum. So believing your following rule is not following the rule. You've got to follow the rule. And by the way, right now, for lots of geopolitical reasons, one of the things I learned at this conference, many things is American Europe is working very well together. You want to get these things done? Get them done now.
