TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

a Palantir CEO Alex Carp never won to hold back. He has now been calling out corporate America for its silence following Hamas's attack on his real October 7th. Here's what we had to say yesterday in Washington about the protests across college campuses and potentially hiring from them as well. Of course, I've been calling out the thin, curative, cancerous ideology that regresses below Judaism, Islam and Christianity and any way, foreign Western thought that is now a pagan religion infecting our universities because it's dangerous to America. It is dangerous to allow discrimination on our college campuses simply because the people are being discriminated against are viewed as successful. That is really dangerous. And we have, especially people like me who view themselves as progressive, need to stand up. What it's divided, I've had people, mostly in the corporate case, people are like, are you sure you should say that? And are like, supportive, I would say in my intellectual circles, yeah, there are a lot of people, especially on the Israel issue that are uncomfortable with my position. And I sometimes fight with them. But I'll tell you, it's important for building a software company that you say in public, what you say in private. We kind of just think these things that are happening across college campuses, especially are like a side show. No, they are the show. Because if we lose the intellectual debate, you will not be able to deploy any army in the West ever. And that's, and of course our adversaries, why don't we talk about why there's no tech scene in China or Russia? Like there is no tech scene. There are no software companies. Why don't we bring the intellectual battle to them? Hey, you want a tech scene that can support your GDP? You've got to have a free, open, meritocratic, diverse, intellectually curious environment where you get to keep the equity that you build. Like we're just not showing up for that debate. And that is the debate where we win or lose.
