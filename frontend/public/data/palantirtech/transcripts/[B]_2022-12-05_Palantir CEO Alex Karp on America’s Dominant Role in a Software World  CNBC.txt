TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Welcome back to Squack on the Street. Over the weekend I attended the annual Reagan National Defense Forum out in Simi Valley, California. In the first of a series of interviews that we will be bringing you this week, I caught up with Pound, your CEO and co-founder Alex Carp to discuss the data analytics company's role in the war in Ukraine, demand from government as well as commercial customers and businesses. Even as a reaction to Wall Street's reaction to the stock. Take a listen. We spent well over a decade. Certainly if you look from inception, building products for peace so you could distribute vaccines and organize many of the most important institutions in the world. But of course products of war, we believed and believed. Unlike most of our colleagues in Silicon Valley, if you are strong, you prevent the adversary from acting up. And that's why we thought this war might happen. We build products that allow you to do very high-end AI-enabled targeting. Most of the details we can't discuss, but our adversaries are very, very well aware now of their impact. These products have changed the course of history. They changed the power structure of America. And perhaps most importantly is a former academic. Our adversaries used to run around the world. Most we have a very significant business outside of America saying, well, America has liberty and entertainment and freedom, but we're better at fighting wars, we're better at building products of war, we're better at internal and surveillance. Now lo and behold, it turns out those of us who are purveyors, not just of war products, but of liberty, most importantly, the United States of America, are not only better at entertainment and having fun, we're also better at building products of war. And that narrative, I think, is going to change the world, is already changing the world. Because of the many things we're not allowed to say that have happened in the Ukraine, our adversaries know every single one of them. So we are no longer viewed America as just a place that produces the most important articles of liberty, but as a culture that builds the best software. There's a lot I want to pick up on there. I guess the first thing though is, I see these conversations happening in places like this forum, this idea that we have to move more quickly where things like software and new technologies are concerned. Do you know the other entities are not doing enough or not deploying enough, but then I hear you talk and it sounds like maybe that's not necessarily the case, at least we're a Palantirist concerned. A lot of tech companies are now there, not all, but when we had our conversation last year, we were still in a phase where most software companies, and certainly most companies in Silicon Valley, their basic view is how can we help the adversary while pretending to help America. So first and foremost, what we need to do in America is make sure that everyone in Silicon Valley is aligned with, we are going to give our best products and our best technology to the US government first, not second, fourth and fifth while pretending we care because we've got some crazy idea that no one cares about that makes us feel superior to everyone else. That's the most important thing. The US economy, we're seeing this in our software sales in the US, and especially the US government. Sure, there's a lot you can complain about, but it is the best at adaptation. We had to fight our way in the DOD, people because of the size and footprint of our work they think we're inside of us. We see the US government not once but twice, not to buy Palantir, but to buy the best software, and we won twice. And so the US government has been iterating and adopting and adopting, and adopting quite frankly the larger problem is many of our allies are living in the 70s where hardware alone could work and sending all their money on local industry that isn't really that good of software. So I think the onus of us in technology is to really invest, of course most companies can't be focused on the US military the way we are because it's a course of our mission, but they can't be focused last on the US military and then complain that it's too hard. Is it changing now because of Ukraine? Well, there's a lot to changing. It's an already fairly good situation is getting better for technology companies because the US economy and US people institutions in general are very pragmatic. They're much less ideological than in other countries are like, well what worked, how did it work, how much did we spend on it and what were the results? It's a very American way of looking at something and it is exactly the way you look at tech and limitation whether it's a company or a government. And you know there's the outside version of what you're allowed to say, but the inside version with all the data, a lot of which is classified, you see that it is not just a minority that we are in a software world, we are in a software world. And what's also interesting is what is the American indisputably the best in the world at doing building software? And no one doubts it's interesting if you ask most Americans about what we're good at football, we're good at films that I never watch. I don't know, we have a great finance industry, we're good at having politicians that none of us really understand. We have a lot of aptitudes, but actually what we're the best at is building software and it turns out for transforming your industry in hard times and winning against adversaries, it is the single most important thing. It sort of speaks to what you talked about in your recent letter which was you've shifted from insurgent outsider to incumbent, this idea of software as a prime, how big is that opportunity for a volunteer? Well America spends about $800 billion on software, by the way we're also very big in Britain and a number of other countries. So, you know, use a term I hate that financial people love, total addressable market is probably north of $900 billion. And we believe we have the single most important components for adaptive warfare against a large adversary that's willing to allow their troops to die. And that's exactly what you see us on the Ukraine, and that the percentage of the $900 billion that we would be able to capture is obviously very large because primatic people are like why can spend $100 billion on something that maybe has marginal impact that our adversaries by the way, when you're looking at value you always have to ask what is it that I can build the adversary can't build? So, there's a lot of things that are going to shift simply because we're building things adversaries can also build, but software they will not be able to keep up with us. And so, more and more of that market is going to come to not just in palatures direction, but in the direction of people that can build software that is useful or critical for warfare. I mean, we hear so much about China's investment in technologies. We mentioned surveillance states earlier in this conversation. I mean, it's the sort of king surveillance state case in point where we've seen play out in terms of protests and at least initial response to those protests in the last couple of days. Can we really counter China when technology and technology and software are concerned? Are we really that much more dominant when they have a different business model and they've been much more aggressive on the government side? They have a business model of control their citizens and we will not surpass them at that and thank God. We have a business model in America to increase liberty at home and to make sure adversaries that attack us or allies pay a very, very heavy price. We need to stay focused on our business model. If it's about central control, either of economy or of your citizens, they win. If it's about distributed systems where you share information that's crucial for weapons of war with your adversaries, we have a huge advantage. We actually have allies and friends. Let's talk a little bit about the commercial side of the business, especially when you're talking about technologies that have been applied to, for example, evacuations in Afghanistan being the same type of technologies that are now being purchased. By commercial entities. Well, what we see is that the most important market in the world, the U.S. of A is also the most adaptive market in the world. Our commercial offering is flying off the shelf. We grew in the last 12 months, 102% in the U.S. America adapts, adapts, adapts, adapts, adapts. And we'll, in the end, buy the single best products on the market. That's why we're succeeding. Despite the fact that we're new to this game and by building out a commercial sales force and doing all sorts of things, normal companies are doing communicating with normal, otherwise adult people is not our something we're particularly adept at. But we are very good at building software. That's the same software use cases that you have in government can be applied to America. Do you think Wall Street truly understands what Palantir is doing, particularly on the commercial side, particularly given the fact that stocks down something like 60% this year? Well, I think Wall Street largely understands where a tech company and punishes all tech companies right now. The interesting thing about Palantir is all of our products, historically, whether it's our Intel product, what's the mapping toggles, it's the AI product that's now changed the world, the product that we built for distributive vaccine, it's been five years ahead of the market. Our commercial offering is five years ahead, three, four years ahead of what Wall Street probably understands. Wall Street will very well understand the value of Palantir as they begin to take a fact of, take account of the fact that we're just outstripping everyone with our Foundry product. It will take a while, just like honestly, when we were talking last year and I was saying, hey, you know, we're going to do ABCD. Well, that looks bad. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's crazy when Russia goes into a country in the software. It's the exact same thing when it comes to Palantir's full value. And by the way, I would also say Palantir has always been over and undervalued and clearly we're undervalued, but at some point we'll be overvalued again.
