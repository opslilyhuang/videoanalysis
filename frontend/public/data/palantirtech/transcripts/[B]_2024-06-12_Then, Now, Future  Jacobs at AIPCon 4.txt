I'm great to hear all the conversations that people have been having around how they're continue to advance the development of Palantir on their platform to drive business decisions. So first of all, thank you for having us here again today. On behalf of the entire Jacobs family, we are so excited to share some of the advancements and developments that we're making on the Foundry platform and with AIP, with our partnership with Palantir. For those of you that aren't that familiar with Jacobs, dot, dot, dot, yet, we are one of the world's largest engineering and technology service providers across the world. And our business started with deep engineering routes really in the chemical process industry and over the course of nearly eight decades, we've expanded into many different markets. Most iconic projects that you see on the world stage, Jacobs' has had the opportunity to help bring that to life. Whether that's through scientific discovery with launching Artemis to the moon, developing new materials and science elements around NASA, that's core in parcel to what we do. As well as major program delivery to deliver new critical infrastructure to bring water from the Central Valley in California down to the south, whether it's a major Olympics program that we're helping deliver in places like London, bringing World Cup Soccer to Qatar or Dubai Expo. We're a part of all of that. And also in places like Advanced Manufacturing, we deliver help deliver semi-conductor chips to our clients. And we are very proud and joyful that we were helped, we were able to help a lot of our pharmaceutical customers deliver COVID vaccines. And we do this every day and our business is really around making our clients' businesses better businesses. And so our purpose at Jacobs is to challenge today to reinvent tomorrow. And we do that by solving some of the world's toughest challenges on the world stage with an aim to create a more connected and sustainable world. You can find us on www. Jacobs.com. All right. So just about two years ago we launched our partnership with Palantir and we joined forces specifically to look at how we can revolutionize wastewater management systems. And although some of you also might not think about the excitement that we can drive in this area, we're highly focused on taking things like reducing energy to fundamentally reduce the carbon footprint. We're helping solve chemical usage challenges. And of course like many people have talked about here today, solving the continued challenge with bringing talent, attracting and retaining talent in the workforce. And of course our core focus is to make sure that everybody goes home safer and better often when they start at each work day. And so for this, this is top of mind. This is obviously top of mind for our customers. And with the Palantir platform along with Jacobs' smart algorithms, we've been able to earn plant management staff and operators with the necessary data and science to help them enable their work with proactive data, data driven operations to help them maximize performance, drive cost savings and help us create that more connected and sustainable world. So I wanted to share with you just a couple examples from last year, really exactly a year ago this week, when we talked about some of the work that we're doing in wastewater treatment. And so the first one, if you think about rising sea levels, stronger and more frequent hurricanes, and of course the flooding that continues to increase are just some of the few impacts that the climate crisis is having on lives for Puerto Ricans. And so we're working with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sur Authority to develop a digital resiliency and response system to support those day to day operations, whether that's planning, response and recovery efforts, all related to catastrophic events. And this enterprise level digital solution really helps us integrate advanced sensing data, communication, hardware and software technologies to create an integrated digital platform that helps enhance that situational awareness, improve operational efficiency, and ensure durability and sustainability in their service for their customers. When we were excited, we just announced an Omaha that we're bringing a digitally enabled view to create a control network decision framework for them to operate their wastewater collection systems. And of course we continue to build out our intelligent own platform for our clients where we deliver chemical energy and maintenance optimization across the entire life cycle of their facilities. So whether it's our clients, most advanced challenges, we've found ways to leverage data and AI to continue to improve their operations. And so as we continue to evolve our partnership, we were implementing other solutions that bring together data from these disparate systems and deploy AI to our clients. Internally at Jacobs, we're using the AIP platform as well to really help us bring new internal enterprise tooling, leveraging AIP to facilitate a safe and responsible use of gendered at AI across all of our workflows. So this is things like knowledge management when we go to propose for our customers, whether that's best practices for our engineers to deliver programs or of course how we're building products leveraging generative AI to work through our product backlog. And then finally we're really excited here today to share with you that we are one of the first adopters to put some of our key workflows. We've put 10 workflows on the AIP now marketplace that makes it available to all of our current and future customers to see how we're leveraging our deep domain expertise in the industries in which we work to help them bring AI and data driven solutions to their operations. And we're using the Palantir Bootcamp approach to really ideate and find out how we can further iterate on those workflows to make that all come to life for our customers. So we're really excited about that. And as many of you have heard, I think it's always important to reiterate the work that we do puts a human at the center of everything. And we're looking at building this digitally enabled ecosystem around them. It's not to replace humans. It's to help them have a better human experience. And we really look at this three ways. So first of all, we're looking at future proofing our workforce. Talent is on demand. The speed and pace of change that we're dealing with. If it's internal to your own company or how you service your customers, it's absolutely core and critical. We're excited that our younger workforce loves technology. They come to work and they expect a digitally enabled world. We're going to show you some of the advancements that we're looking at on that front. And of course, helping drive that world for them is really important. The second is absolutely health and safety is critical to our employees. I'll say it again. We, at Jacobs, aspire that everybody goes home safer and better off than when they started their work day. And we think AI, generative AI, digitally enabled world helps deliver on that promise. And then lastly, the best innovation comes from those people that are working on the front line, hearing their ideas, their ways that we can leverage technology to make their experience even better is what fuels and propels us going forward from an innovation perspective. All right. So let's take a look at some of the future things that we're thinking about. So looking to the future, Palantir's front line mixed reality capabilities, we think people complement our technology goals of worker enablement and job site safety no matter what industrial site our teams are at. With integrated displays in their hard hat and their PPE, workers gain access to data and insights in the field, where it's most relevant and most critical. These can be utilized in a wide variety of work environments and settings. First and foremost, bringing a health and safety focus to ensure the well-being of our employees. An initial example of this integrated PPE display is pulling up a schematic on the fly for a system or a component that an engineer is working on. The evolution of this is in mixed reality. It's a full immersive experience showing our workers labeled components, their statuses and readings from connected sensors within the facility. And this obviously connects to the Palantir platform to highlight optimization, actions in the field and in real time assigning tasks to specific workers. And finally, while performing these operational tasks, the system will integrate workplace safety, alerting for hazardous environments to prevent accidents. So we're using this as a focal point to look at how we can drive technology going forward to improve the safety and well-being of all of our workers and operators at facilities all around the world. And lastly, I'll just leave you with, I think the future is really bright. I don't think there's any universe where a plant operator, an engineer, or somebody building not a capital program for their business operations is not digitally enabled. And the ability to bring data and AI to the forefront of that, to operate as that co-pilot, to make smarter decisions in the environment that we're working in is absolutely part of what we're trying to drive to bring a more connected and sustainable world to all of our customers. So thank you for your time today. I look forward to speaking with you all.
