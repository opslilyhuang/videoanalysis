TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning, everyone. They said usually they saved the best for last. I don't know why they stressed usually, but that's OK. But I do really appreciate the opportunity to talk about our journey. And so Nebraska Medicine is an academic medical center located in Omaha, Nebraska. And we provide clinical services that aren't available anywhere else in the region. And our goal is easy access to world-class health care. A couple of years ago, we were having challenges with operational efficiency cost as well as staffing. It was really difficult for us to accept transfers from other health systems and really meet the needs of the broader community. So we started looking for a partner that would help us create a new health system operating system that could really transform and rewrite the way that we do things. And my mantra is build confidence, earn trust. So we reached out to the leading health systems across the country. And one name kept being mentioned every single time, which was palindered. So we sat up meetings with Drew and Jeremy and others and realized that they got it. They got health care is too important to not transform to better serve people. And so we agreed to go together. Part of that build confidence, earn trust. They made it very clear that we could protect our patient data, keep it separate from others, and really work together to transform. So we set the battle cry of must go faster. And boy, have we. In fact, we've been using the term a palindere unit of time. And that represents when we're driving value and less than an hour. If you look at the revenue cycle, we generated an appeals letter and less than an hour and submitted it successfully to the insurance company in about 90 minutes total. We got estimates of rewriting a supply chain application. And we were told it would take 2 and 1 half to 3 months. In 46 minutes, they had a live product, inclusive of machine learning, and AI. This is allowing us to have real time solution decision making that is allowing us to think differently on how we take on challenges within the health system. In fact, we renamed forward deployment engineers forward success engineers, because they're really helping us engineer a more successful way to get things done within our system. We started with staffing and capacity management. Staffing, we needed a way to dynamically adjust the number of nurses taking care of patients based on acuity. We also wanted to factor in their preferences and take in consideration the higher cost of agency nurses in premium pay. This, as well as other efforts across our health system, we've been able to achieve less than 50% nurse turnover compared to national averages. If you look at our capacity management, efforts to shorten length of stay and get patients out of the hospital earlier, and I'll talk more about this in a second, we saw a 2100% increase use of our discharge lounge. You heard me correctly. Greater than a 2,000% improvement. This is resulted to the equivalent of adding another unit to our hospital. Very transformational for sure. As I said, we provide services that no one else does. And because two years ago, 18 months ago, in fact, when we started with Palantir, we had capacity constraints. Greater than 90% average daily census every single day. And so those efforts to reduce and improve throughput through the hospital, like I said, one unit, 35 additional beds, has now allowed us to see a 13% increase in transfers. So I'm going to walk you through that demonstration now. The system is going and looking at admissions through our emergency room, direct admissions, as well as discharges, and bringing forward patients that meet defined criteria based on ours. Urgent cases, we always take them, but urgent cases where there may be able to be served somewhere else in the community, we may not have the capacity. So if we drill in on Sally, Sally's here for what needs to be transferred at TAVR, a multidisciplinary, high complex surgery, we can drill in and look at the bigger picture, all of the admissions, all of the discharges, and pick Sally and get more information. Says why she needs to be transferred, and gives us minute by minute. In fact, it's a 95% discharge prediction accuracy. That is allowing us to more confidently accept patients transferred, improving quality and safety, as well as a better experience for them, and piece for their family that they know that they're going to receive the care they deserve. So TAVR is a trans catheter, aortic valve replacement, and it's not just a simple of slotting it into an OR. You need a special hybrid room, because it involves both cardiologists, as well as a cardiothoracic surgeon, as well as special radiology equipment. So it's not a matter of just drag and drop. It actually reads through the entire chart, and looks through what else might be planned, what are comorbidities, what are other risk factors, then it compares it to that unique surgeons, average time for similar cases. In this case, 57 similar cases, predicted a two hour and seven minute case time. We can then go back and start staffing that team. Figure out, think of your fantasy baseball team, is you want to have the right certification, the right training, and build out not only that case, but you have to move other people around on the schedule. So make sure that you have people with the right skills, and they get to do the cases that they want to do as well. And if you drill into that TAVR, you can see the other cases that had to be moved to make room. We'll talk about that baseball metaphor with the baseball cards. This looks at our HR service, our system, it looks at our time and attendance, it looks at our certification requirements, to make sure that the staff is done an appropriate number of these cases that our organization to confidently staff them out. So the right people in the right case, at the right time, also makes the staff happier, they get to do more advanced cases if they've had that training. We also have to free up space within the hospital, and I talked about the discharge lounge, and these are individuals that are ready to go home, but they're waiting for maybe medications for pharmacy, they're ride to pick them up, or other Venition and Fusion. This work not only benefited those patients, it's reduced our overall discharge time from order to discharge across the organization by one hour. So that's added to our capacity. This is based on our preference, our guidelines, and you see here is the authoring tool that allows you to create that capacity. So Sally will need a cardiac care unit. The system goes and looks right now, there's no room availability, and it analyzes what patients might be ready. This used to be multiple screens that you had to go through, you had to process the different guidelines and protocols, that's now all been ingested in the system. It's able to read the notes and make the determination is this patient ready to move into the discharge lounge. So, Palantir has allowed us to be impactful in multiple different parts of our organization to improve quality, experience, and safety. You can't jump a 20-foot chasm of problems with two 10-foot leaps. You really have to have a partner that helps build a bridge to the future, and Palantir is allowing us to do that. Like I said, things like the discharge lounge, length of stay, improving our perioperative, all together, making sure that we're improving quality and safety, but we also have to be appropriately reimbursed. There are occasions where insurance companies will challenge that reimbursement, and we have to go through utilization management process. And that's using physicians that are reviewing, and our average was 80 minutes now reduced down to seven. That's not the only benefit from 50 to 70 pages of documents are now down to two that are optimized to the specific needs of that insurer improving their experience as well. This capability to process huge amounts of information and look for, like a diagnostic machine, look for things that aren't readily available and visible on the surface, like a chest x-ray, we're also looking at errors across the system. And so medical errors, unfortunately, do happen. In 2016, Johns Hopkins published, it's the number three cause of death in the United States. We're doing everything we possibly can to make the safest health care. With Palantir, our partnership is going to allow us to achieve our goal of easy access to world-class health care. Thank you. I think that caused the stock to move so quickly. The technology to focus on social media, the science health community and the avait. I mean, the video of where ever the data has changed, is a huge big big range research. The police are open right now, and by the way, these people,
