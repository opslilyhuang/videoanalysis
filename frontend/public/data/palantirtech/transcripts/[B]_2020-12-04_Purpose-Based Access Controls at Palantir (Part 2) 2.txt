TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Now that we've discussed the basics of purpose-based access controls, let's talk about how data gets added to a purpose. In this demo, I will first take on the role of a purpose owner for PPE distribution, requesting the addition of data to my purpose. Then I'll take on the role of a data owner evaluating this request. As a purpose owner, I have access to this administrative view of my purpose. By adding purpose leads, I can assign qualified delegates to help evaluate access requests. Having multiple people available to evaluate these requests can help ensure that each one receives the appropriate amount of scrutiny. I can assign an expiry date to the purpose so that when the date is reached, foundry will refocus access, delete data, or flag the purpose to a senior data governance user for review. If a new data asset becomes available that I believe is well-scoped to my purpose, I can issue a request to the data owner of that asset asking approval for it to be added to my purpose. When I click Add Data Assets, I'm presented with a list of the data sets available on the platform. I select the appropriate data asset and initiate my request. I must then write a justification to the data asset owner, explaining why I believe this specific data asset is necessary, proportional, and compliant for my purpose. If this request is approved, this data asset will then become available to the approved users of my purpose. I'll now switch roles to the data asset owner. This data governance decision maker is a representative of the organization that owns the data set being requested. In this role, I have an inbox of requests from purpose owners asking for my data assets to be approved for use within their purpose. If I click into one of these requests, Fandry presents me with metadata to help inform my decision. I can see which data asset has been requested for which purpose, and who has made this request. I can see the justification provided, and if any similar requests have been denied in the past, by clicking into the relevant purpose, I can see which data assets are already available for this purpose. If the data set that has been requested contains de-identified personal data, I can evaluate re-identification risks that might come with other data already in this purpose. As before, I can request further information and the attachment of approvals in the platform. Once I'm confident that I have the information I need, I can make my final decision for which I must also enter a justification. Now we're all set, and I can approve this request. Thank you for watching this demo, and we look forward to providing more insights throughout the Palantir Explained series.
