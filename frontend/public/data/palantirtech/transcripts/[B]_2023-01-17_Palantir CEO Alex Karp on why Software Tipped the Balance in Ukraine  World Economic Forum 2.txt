TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Alex Carp, thank you for being here. How many times have we been doing this? Many, many times, yeah. And we've been through a bit of a roller coaster in terms of the economy, in terms of the world, geopolitics and everything. What is your sense now? And what do you think the sensibility is here right now? Look, we've been meeting for many, many years. And when we first met here and you filmed me the idea that the world is just joined to it violent, unlikely to be pure and global, that world leaders would fight more than they get along, that there would be derision and division into major democracies. And that we'd see a war in Europe looked like the nightmare fantasy of something that you would not believe could happen. And of course, we built our company on the idea that the world is disjuncted violent, but could be made better. I think the core issue for people behind closed doors at Davos is, OK, clearly the world is not going to be the way we thought it is. It clearly is not going to be more peaceful, less disjointed. How can we still make the world actually function in a separated disjuncted world where there is war in the character of Europe, where Western allies are having to mobilize against their adversaries, including Russia and China, where people still want to have industry, where supply chains are disrupted and where we have pandemics? Your personal optimism or pessimism, though right now, I mean, there's a lot of pessimism here. Yeah, I mean, look, we built our company and I believe in addressing the world as it is. We built our company around the way the world is now. I am pessimistic about the near future, very optimistic about what we can do to help that. So I agree with people around here, but you got to understand both in the especially in the tech industry. And to some extent here, but you have people that were just certain they were going to win. Everything was going to break their way. There were no one would go out with them in high school, but they're going to own the high school and they're going to own the whole state. And everything is going to work out and you know, they're gazillion dollars. And all of a sudden, all these assumptions aren't actually true. And you know, they're in a little bit of a depression funk. And that's normal when things are not breaking away when the world is changing away. But you know, there's a lot of ways to actually make the world a better place. First of all, the West can show we actually have superior technology. And we're showing that. When you said your pessimistic short term, what do you mean by that? Well, I mean, I think that we are just learning as world organizations how to live in a world that is very different than we thought. So I don't think the war is likely to end in you, Craig. You don't. I think, look, it's very hard to know what's going to happen, but you have an adversary who is zero sum. If Putin goes home and says, hey, we lost, he will lose his life, his friends will lose their life, they'll lose all their money. And he'll go to his grave feeling that he lost, which he does not want to do. We in the West, most of us in the West correctly believe if we allow these kind of things to happen, if we allow people to violate the sovereignty of a land and rape, pillage, and destroy people who are innocent in that land, that this will set a horrible precedent. So we can't allow that to happen. Also, we've shown that we developed superior technology and combined with heroes on the ground, we can actually win. And so this is just still a class of culture. That's a pessimistic view geopolitically of potential war and the like. What's your view of the economy and the ramifications? And maybe it's a ramification of war. Now, I think that the chief thing hurting the economy is we're an unknown zone where things are happening. We didn't plan like wars trying to deal with the wars, inflation. We're also highly divided inside of our countries in the West. What do you make of? You have a lot of corporate clients here. It's not just governments. The feeling from them, their ability to buy, spend more or not right now. Well, they're going to just like in a war situation because our clients are not in a war situation where it's like not like the Ukraine. But to fact, it was the same thing. We have to survive under much harder conditions. And what are they going to do? They're going to figure out what works, what doesn't, what's a power point, what's a fraud, what's actually transforming the business. American businesses here by and large have a huge advantage, which America underestimates. What makes Americans interesting? We are very, very pragmatic. We adapt. We learn. We change. You said, what's a power point and what's a fraud? And the reason I raise it is a lot of people who are running around trying to pretend they're businesses like yours or pretend they're all sorts of businesses. What do you think of the wash out that's happened in Silicon Valley across the world? It's very, very, very hard to be joyous because people are in pain. But I mean, we compete against power points and basic and technology that is useful but not transformative. What the situation like the current one we're in, whether it's war in Ukraine, like why did they adopt Paladir? Because you can't afford a power point or a power point when your life is on the line. What's happening to businesses? The revenues are going down. There's highly, the regulation is going up. The workforce is unhappy for lots of reasons. They have to somehow rebuild their culture and attack. And that exposes things in your business that are both good, bad, ugly and transformative. And of course everybody wants to be like, there's the palantir of mycockroach.com farm. And it's like, we are the best palantir for making sure that cockroaches and others get proper nutrition. And yeah, that works under bad conditions but it does not under good conditions. It does not work under bad conditions. What do you make though of the valuations that have taken place in Teclan, including to your own company? Look, we've been at this for almost 20 years. Our valuation has been very high and very low. What we're very interested in is how is the business doing? I run this business for better or worse. I know how the business is doing. And by the way, over the medium term, not the short term, valuations do affect our business. And in the short term, that fluctuation evaluations expose people are out on the beach naked. If you're out swimming naked, which by the way I embrace, it's kind of hard when, you know, it's just like, if you're out here without the proper coat, it exposes the weakness in certain businesses. In the end, especially in America, we're adaptive. Those stronger businesses will grow, thrive, expand. And we'll end up with a much higher. What do you tell investors to say, look, this stock has fallen. I mean, I tell you and tell you, well, investors, I tell our employees, look, there's market conditions that affects the share price. But is it market conditions? Is it the way the market views your particular company that there are investors who are frustrated with what they call dilution? They're legitimate and concerns we have to address. So dilution, what are the revenues going to be? Where are the revenues going to develop? How transformative the products, all legitimate concerns? What are the investors we have primarily, our most important investors are co-workers. What we believe is our business is stronger than it's ever been. And we have a lot of evidence that convinces us. We believe our conviction will convince the world over a multi-year period. And that's what I care about. And the question is, where the valuations before? When this is the case, when we're talking about the cost of the stock, we're talking about the cost of the stock. The question is, where the valuations before? When this stock was $40 stock. Look, let me tell you something. One of the things that's been most helpful about riding this company is that when you're kind of outside the norm, a little bit of a freak show, I never thought we were that good when the share price was $40, whatever. I didn't think we were that bad when the share price was $6, or whatever it is. I know that I know what makes the business strong and I'm focused on that. I honestly never thought I was that perfect at $40. I don't think I'm that bad now. I think it's just like you work on the business, you work on the... You have a huge problem if you're like full on normal Silicon Valley capitalists pretending you care about altruism or whatever, that you actually judge your life by the share price. Let me just ask you one other investor-related question, which is, who should the investor base compare your company to? So some people say, oh, it's a consulting company. We should look at Accenture. It should be a multiple of that or not. Other people say, oh, it's a software company. There's some words you'd be in the middle of maybe. What is... If you doubt what our company is, talk to the Ukrainians, talk to the CEO of Hertz, talk to BP, talk to the Special Forces, they'll tell you, this product saved my life or made my company better. And, you know, if you don't have to believe me, believe them. There was a fascinating piece in the Washington Post that really described what Palantir has done and its involvement in Ukraine in a very detailed way. I mean, you've alluded to it in some of the interviews that we've done over the years. How is that changing the business? And now that that's public, if you will, is it changed the kind of conversation you can have? Look, we built PG, which single-handedly stopped the rise of the far right in Europe. We built Foundry, which was used as tribute to COVID vaccine and saved millions of lives globally. We built what we call multi-conculation, and what's often called the digital-kill chain. And, they're category-defining products. So, when you deliver these products to the market, just honestly people say this isn't going to exist, this isn't valuable. But then it changes the market. And then the market is the Palantir market. Now, that doesn't mean everyone in the world is going to buy our product. But it means most of the sensible people in the world are going to define, buy from the category we defined. And that is exactly what's happening in the war-fighting context. And that's happening because of, I mean, you have to look at this. You have a small country that galvanizes its country, brings its heroes and forth. And they're up against the third most important army in the world. And they win. Every single country in the world that finds out that ask, well, how did you do it? What can we do? What is the cost of that? How long does the implementation take? I always ask you this, but given the increasing tensions, it appears between the US and China, where are we? What are our capabilities? What do you worry about? We are very lucky that Chinese government is very focused on internal security. The US has to heavily, heavily, and its allies, focus on external security. We are better at software than the Chinese, but we're also better at focusing on something we care about. How do you repel an adversary that wants to invade your territory? It should be the single focus of the, and we are partly because we're better at it and partly because that's the need. If we had a conversation here 10 years, time, with China taking Taiwan, tried to take Taiwan, what do you think happens? I think it largely depends on how powerful our software hardware hero quotient is. If we continue to do it, we're doing the Ukraine. If Russia had known what Russia knows now, I think there's a pretty strong chance they would not have invaded. Spacks. What was the lesson of investing in SPACS? Most companies were not prepared for bad weather, like we were. Stay away from companies that are not prepared for bad weather. That was the lesson, but you invested in companies that were not prepared for bad weather. Exactly. We should be more investing in ourselves, not investing in companies that are not prepared for bad weather. How did that happen? Look, we are the world's best in my view of building software before people need to software. You make mistakes along the way. We made a mistake. We corrected it. We're moved on.
