TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello. How are you? Good to see you. Nice to meet you. We work together for a long time. Yes, exactly. And you can tell us what you've come to the party. And then... Will you ask me for a few questions? Yes, of course. I'm going to the party. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good to see you. Nice to see you. We work together for a long time. Exactly. And maybe you can tell us what you've come to the party. And then... Will you ask me for a few questions? And then we'll see how it goes. It's going well. Yes, so I came to the party five years ago. I had a lot of fascination because I didn't come back to work in the team. But you had to tell me what you've done before. Yes. I was in the business, actually. I also had a business career in the business. I had the business in the company. I was fascinated by the protection of the data. Somehow, I was amazed that these topics are so exciting that I actually want to work on them. And that's what I've always wanted to do with my country. That we, in the open, are also in private areas, in extreme, exciting topics. And we actually also think about what role the digital technology plays in. In the presence of the future, we can also make a contribution to the responsibility of digital technology. And at the same time, I also worked effectively with it. And then I then had a scientific work with the private civil liberties teams in the Netherlands. So I would describe that as a data protection and data-ethic team. And I was totally fascinated by the quality of the team, and software engineers, data scientists. But you didn't start our company a little skeptical. I mean, you come from a scientific work room, from a secret service to our product. And what was your advantage? And how did you get to stay in the parliament, when these advantageers are nachvollziehwers? Yes. So that's true. And that's also a topic that I would like to talk to you about. Of course, it will be a palette after, as well as a critical, especially from a data protection perspective. I think, because we also work on very sensitive regions of the project. And of course, I was also asked why you go there? And then, to someone who, often times, also, is in this topic in the criticism, but I think what I had convinced over this was the fact that I actually work with people who, before these difficult questions, don't step back. You can say one side, okay. Police or secret services, of course, you have to work with data, but it will be more or less difficult, and you have to give control there. And also, on the technical level, you have to build a control. But at the end, you say, I don't want to do that. I often get up and I keep going out there. Or you get the airman up and try to actually make a positive contribution to the project. What I have convinced in the Netherlands, that I have learned from people who have really been involved in this topic and really wanted to make a positive contribution to the project. Especially from data protection and data protection. It is also my idea to imagine in Europe, but sometimes in America, that we have thought about the data protection in the afternoon. When in the summer, a big secret, which is not secret, it is all about the fact that we don't buy much. It is that the data integration of the beginning was the data protection of the data protection and the data protection was possible. But, yes, I have a question. Why is the case that the architecture from the parliament, the ability to deal with data protection and to go to the parliament, would this be the case when I bought our money? Yes. What I have experienced is that we work in a highly emotional area. Of course, digitalization is, as before, a lot of fear. What automatization works, jobs, we will be able to achieve a good intelligence. I mean, if you look at the platform as a parent, of course, our strengths are under the data integration. So, the different data can communicate with each other, what might not be the case. What I have experienced, and what is exciting for me, I had been in power before the data protection protection was created in the past two years. I can ask you again, can we work with the parliament platform, with the DESGVO, and what I am very excited about. Because this platform, the functionalities we have started, have been created in the platform. This is one of the most difficult to get data, but then it is also differentiated to work with it. This is exactly the functionality. This is also a way to protect our debt protection in Europe. The ARMYs, I am proud of them, are also installed. This is also an American-speaking representative, who has been in America for thousands of years, who have been created, and are a bit of an European-speaking, in America, in the US, in Europe. But one of the best examples of this statement, which is called the software in the UK, is that the state protection is so frappier, and the extreme, even the rest of the EU, that we have built in the past 10 years. Yes, and I mean, it must have been a bit of a mistake, because I have not been in America for thousands of years, and I have invested in data, so they do not have to look at it in the future. I have not looked at it in the future, they have tried to distribute the financials. What is not on the hand, when you have the software, is that the software is not able to go to a platform in the range of data protection. You have to build the possibilities of the basic needs, which can later be used to distribute data protection, as well as the rest of the EU. And that has still been done for a few years, to build it up, and only a small amount of software developed in the software is a way to build a motor. We have to say, but we also have to say, that the basic settings in the chiefs, which is something that is in Germany, is a very large role in the parliament, which is a very large role. The most software platforms are as deep as you need to sell them. The platforms from parliament are very, very deep, and are perhaps too complicated, so that it has been long since that the public can go there and set them up in the system to set them up in their institutions. That is why it is always a great disadvantage that we have been able to go into the deep, but how do we go into the deep? Are we extremely critical? Are we completely and extremely aware of the people who like to go into the deep? And then we get these products. What would you say to people between data protection and innovation? Because these debates, I think, often in Germany, with the Covid-19 pandemic, where it is often clear that we are in a lot of areas behind what they are doing often. Do we have data protection or is it the data protection that we would be in the way? I think so. I think it is nice that this diplomat is outstructed. So is this the most a very large percent of the number of swiss reported in jail. So do other things like So, also, actually, to avoid the software in the store is both the same. And the language is actually not a language, because my experience is almost 20 years old. It is so that exactly when you are forced to choose the data protection, you then see all the data you see. Without the use of the device, most of you have to choose the data you see, simply because the data is not a good thing. So, and I also find that, and for us in the Netherlands, it is so that we want all our software products to be in the store. Both are possible, and you also have to say that it is a huge advantage for us. Yes, and you need to understand this environment, about your data, about what life is, about which data are added, how data are being processed over time. I think it is a major important thing for us in Germany. Of course, the transparency of the data processing, the processing of the data processing, remains what is also very important in the area of artificial intelligence. KI is a very popular term. It is important for the German public first, in general, that the data management of data is transparent, and it is also very important for the company. Transparency also means that you can push it over, like an analyst or someone to an audience, or you have already seen that before, you can already imagine that the data you have looked at, not only are real data, but also very fast. As you said, you talk often of artificial intelligence, where many different types of software and hand-in-hand algorithms are understood. On one hand, you only have machine learning, that is just the probability of an algorithm to have a way back, what you already know, but faster. On the other hand, what is already available in artificial intelligence is that in the background, a computer can think like a person or better, faster, deeper and more widely. There are not yet come, but we are already on our way. What is also the case with the parent, is that we also have the platforms, so that the two are connected to the transparency of the parent in the motor, or that with algorithms that are also available with the data, in the M.R. and to the point where you have not yet come, you can also focus on people who are later doing it. I think the data protection law, as well as the German public, will be long enough to see how the hand-in-hand data can be developed. How can you generate the software development, but artificial intelligence, especially responsible, do you know how to develop it? Well, you can do a lot of things, but not everything. You have to see that all the technologies can be misused. So it is, so if a public, to say that the parent can never be misused, or artificial intelligence can not be a dangerous threat to humanity, then it can be somehow possible. What can be done in Europe and what all people can do, is to have a system that also has a hand-in-hand data in the range of artificial intelligence. And of course, they must have made a certain decision. You can force it where the data are coming from. You can force it as with data, as the data is generated from the other. You can take the model from the other side. You can do a third of the software development, which is to force these cats. You can actually have the system, and the country has a search for data. You have the system, a search for data, and the data, as well as the sovereignty of Europe or Germany. These things must of course be regulated by the people, and the architecture of a software company, where they have to be able to make use of these systems. I would also say, and that is perhaps also the line of my perspective, it must also be able to make use of all the systems, among which they can share the system. Where they can come from. That means, Germany has to make use of these systems. In France, America, Israel and the Suns, they can come with their software. They can say, okay, these are the rules. All the rules that they can make use of these systems can be made from Germany. Or they can sell their software. If it is not possible, then there is a problem where you can prove it, that you can make it on a certain day. Or you can't sell the software without it. Yes. You also talk about important topics, which are open debates in Germany. As a French, I am very present. This is the topic of digital sovereignty. And as an European company, or as an European government, you can always be aware that you are always at the same time, in control of your data, but also your decisions remain. I think, in fact, you will be an American software company, to be able to use criticism, whether you can make it to the world. How can we give our customers the insight that they can trust our software? But there are two points. Can't do that, or can't you mention that you can't do that. We can do that. So, the most software platforms and companies have the problem of it. First, you can't do that. Second, you can't do it tomorrow morning. And third, you can't do that. Because they know exactly what people are doing in the opposite way. They are lying and not going out of it, that the problem may be solved. And the software platforms in the US can also know that the ability to work in a country, but also in other countries, to be able to work in a country where the sovereignity for the legal land can be easily achieved, is a thing where your software is not in the state. We, in the Netherlands, are based on certain names. One of the biggest names was the spread of the world, a different world, for example, so that the West, not the West, but that the trade has, and that the West is completely different. What you see without it, the trade has, in England, Germany, in America, also with people who are the same as the law enforcement of the data protection, is also another. The further explanation is that it will not be built and will be over the past day, that you can work in the US in Germany, without the law enforcement, and the law enforcement of data not in the legal land, and that it can be over-proved. So, I think that there is a problem that is different from the others. We know that we can do that. We want to drive, which is over-proved, not only for us, but for all software companies. From moral reasons, but also from own reasons, because we have thought about it before 20 years, we work very well on these problems since 20 years, and those who are not able to work there, they have to be relatively fast. And from moral reasons, because no one in France, or Germany, can be used to know what the software identity of your data in the Palau Artus is. That is not necessary, and they will not accept it. They have not accepted it, because the people don't understand how their own data is in the past. So, Salau said, we have all the people of the village. I vote for you.
