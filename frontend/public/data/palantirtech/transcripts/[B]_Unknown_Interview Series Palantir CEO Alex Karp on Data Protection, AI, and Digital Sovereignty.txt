TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We are working for a long time together. Exactly. And maybe you can tell us what you've come to Palantir. And then, you'll have to find me. And then you'll have to find me. Servus. Hello. How are you? Good to see you. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. We've been working for a long time together. Exactly. And maybe you can tell us what you've come to Palantir. And then, you'll have to ask me a few questions. And then we'll see how it goes. That's great. So I came to Palantir before five years ago. I had to fascinate the film. Because it didn't come back to work in exciting topics. But you had to tell what you've done before. I was in the Wissenschaft actually. I also had a bit of a career in the Wissenschaft. I had the opportunity to fascinate the film. At some point, I was surprised that these topics are so exciting that I actually want to work on them. And that's why I've always fascinated Palantir. That we, in the open, work in private areas on extremely exciting topics. And we actually also think about what role digital technology plays in the present, but also in the future. And how can we achieve a goal to achieve the responsibility of digital technology? And I also worked on it effectively. And then I had a scientific work with the private civil liberties teams at Palantir. I would say that in German as a data protection and data-ethic team. And I was totally fascinated by the Palantir as a highly interdisciplinary team. And software engineers, data scientists. But you didn't start to be a bit skeptical. I mean, you come to the Wissenschaft for working in a range of secret services with our product. And what was your advantage? And how did you get to stay in Palantir when these advantageers are responsible for it? Yes. So that's true. And that's also a topic that I would like to talk to you about. Of course, Palantir will be, as before, a very critical, especially the data protection perspective. I think, because we also work on very sensitive government projects. And of course, I was also asked, why are you going? And then, to someone who, at times, also, especially in this topic in the criticism, but I think what I had convinced, what the fact that I actually work with people for these difficult questions, I'm not going back. You can say, one side, OK. Police or secret services, of course, also have to work with data. But what is being done is, you know, you have to give control over it. And also, on the technical level, you have to build a control. But at the same time, you say, I don't want to do it. I often get it up and I keep it out. Or you're afraid of the high-end and try to actually make a constructive contribution. What I have convinced Palantir, so that I have learned people who have really wanted to create positive and positive content for this topic. Especially the data protection and data-based perspective. It is also my opinion, the presentation in Europe, but sometimes in America, that we have thought about data protection in the afternoon. When in the state, one of the biggest secret services, there is no secret, it is everywhere, where we don't have to buy much. It is that the data integration of the beginning was the data's data protection, even that was the data protection possible. But, well, I have a question. Why is the case that the architecture from Palantir, the ability to use data protection to go out, would this be so many people bought it? Yes. So what I have experienced is that we work in a highly emotional area. Of course, digitalization is very much afraid of it. What do automatization jobs do? We will be able to get artificial intelligence and, I mean, if you look at Palantir as a platform, of course our strengths are that we can use data to communicate with each other. What can be the case when I was alive. For me, it was exciting. I had two years before the research of the foundation in power was to Palantir. Then I can ask you again, how do we work with Palantir platforms, also with the DESG-VO. What I was very excited about was that these platforms, the functionalities, we have started, we have built, we have not created platforms. This is one of the most important over-the-data platforms. We have also differentiated to work with it. This is a very possible and we have a wide range of research in Europe. The ARMYs, I am proud of, were in America, were in the hub ridges being constructed in Europe, in America, in the US, and in the US, in Europe. The best example of this statement, which we are talking about, in the general world, is that it is used in the future. It is in the state of the protection. So I mean, it is so frappier and extreme, even the rest of the lines of Europe, and that is what we have built for 10 years. Yes, and I mean, it must have been when you were not in the beginning of the 2000s. The ARMYs said, okay, I invest in it, and now in data, you don't have to look at it in the comments. I have not looked at it in the comments, they have threatened to destroy the financial system. And it is so that, what is not on the hand, when you have a software that is writing it back, on a platform in the data protection, does not go up. You have to build the possibilities of the data protection that will later be able to be able to be able to replace the rest of the lines. And that has still been done for a few years, to build it up. And only a small amount of software developed in the state is a way to build a motor. We have to say, but we also have to say, that the basic settings in the chiefs to go to, that once again something that is in Germany is a very large role in the parliament, and still plays. So most software platforms are just as deep as you need to sell them. The platforms from the parliament are very, very deep and perhaps too complicated. So that it has been long since the public has been able to replace the public and replace them in their institutions. And that is why it is always a big disadvantage that we have been a little too deep. But what we have to say is that we have a lot of people who are interested in the products. What would you say to people between data protection and innovation in the field of tension? Because these debates are often seen in Germany with the COVID-19 pandemic, where it is often clear that the digitalization often affects the data protection as well as the data protection that would be in the way. I think that it is nice that this diplomat is outstructed. So it is the most a very large number of data protection in the field of tension and the data protection is being released. It is true that when your software is not in the field of tension is being complicit in the field of tension. So, the key I would say to us and I would also say in Europe that software is both. And the language is actually not a language in the field of tension. So, it is true that when you have the data protection in the field of tension you will see all data that you see. Without the use of the software, the data that you see in the field of tension is not a good thing because the data is not a good thing. And I also think that for us in the field of tension is that we want that all our software products in the field are both possible and we also have to say that it is a huge advantage for us. Yes, and you need to understand about your data about your experience of life. So, in the field of tension we have to understand how the data is being processed by the time the data is processed because I think a big important thing for us in Germany and in Europe is of course the transparency of the data processing and the process of the data processing remains as well as in the field of tension and the process of the data processing is also very important for the company. Transparency also means that the ability to push the data through a list or a given to the product or by the time before someone has already been able to produce data that you have not only but also a fast-earned data processing and the way you talk is often a very complex intelligence where there are many different types of software and software of algorithms and software of algorithms and software of algorithms and software of algorithms and software of algorithms and software of algorithms from the first to the second which is making things more than the texts and not the others thinking of better technical cost sofces and we live on the way If this is algorithm, the data will go to the MMR area. And to the point where you are not yet arrived, you can also focus on people who are later marked. And I think the data protection law, and the German public, will be long enough to focus on people as the trade of your data will be launched. How can you develop the software development but artificial intelligence, especially responsible for development? Well, you can see a lot of things, but not everything. You have to see that all the technologies can be implemented. So if a main reason is to say that the volunteer can never be used or artificial intelligence, no fair amount of humanity can be used. What can be done in Europe and what all people can do, is to have a law that also has a hand-made data in the artificial intelligence. And of course, they must have made certain decisions. You can focus on where the data are coming from. You can focus on how data will be generated from the data. You can take the model from the company. There is no third of the software development. These data can be focused on the law. The law has a law that has a hand-made data in the digital world. The data has a hand-made data in the digital world. These things must be regulated by the company. The architecture of a software company, where they must be able to make a decision with this law. I would also say that this is perhaps also a line-up perspective. It must also be realized that all firms can share the law. I don't know where they come from. That means that German firms must also share the law. From France, America, Israel and the Sunsweau, should also come with their software. They can say, okay, these are the rules. All the laws that can be used can be used in Germany. Or they can sell their software. If you don't do that, you can prove it. You can do it on a certain day. Or you can't sell the software. Yes. You also say important topics that are open to Germany. In France, I am very present. I take the topic of digital sovereignty. As an European company or an European government, you can always be aware of your data and your decisions. I think that a software company will be able to take criticism when they can be aware of the data. How can we give our customers the insight that they can trust in our software? But there are two points. Can't do that. Or can't you talk about people that they can do that? We can do that. The most software platforms and companies have the problem. The first thing they can't do is to know if they can't do it tomorrow or tomorrow. They can't do it tomorrow. Because they know that in contrast to many people who are more popular and can't do it tomorrow, that the problem can be solved by a light. And the software companies in America can know that the ability to work in a country but also in other countries are able to work in a similar country where the sovereignty for a country is able to be used. It's a matter of where your software is not in the situation. We, in the Netherlands, start from certain names. One of the biggest names was the spread of the world. In different worlds, for example, so that the West is no longer the West, but that the trade is just in the frame of data and data protection. The West is completely different. What you see without it, the trade of data in England, Germany, in America, also with people who are the same, namely the power of data protection is also a different one. The further split is namely that it will not be built up and over the past. That you can work in Germany, in America, without the power of data and the implementation and the improvement of data not in the respective countries and that it can be over-proved. So, I think that there is a problem with something different from the others. We know that we can do that. We want to drive that over-proven, not only for us, but for all software companies. From moral reasons, but also from its own reasons, because we have thought about it before 20 years, we work very well on these problems since 20 years, and those who can't work there they have to be relatively fast and from moral reasons, because no one in France or Germany can be used to know what the software identity of your data in Palau has been. That is not necessary, and they will not accept it. They have not been accepted, because people do not understand how much your own data has been accepted. So, Salau said, everyone has the right to say that. I hope so.
