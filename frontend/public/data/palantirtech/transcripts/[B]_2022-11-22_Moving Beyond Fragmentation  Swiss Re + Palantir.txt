Please welcome Group Chief Data Officer and Chief Innovation and Transformation Officer for Corporate Solutions at Swiss Re, Ian Heycock. Hi, good morning everybody. So as introduced my name is Ian Heycock, I work at Swiss Re and what's interesting is I have this little talk today on the connected company and some of the topics have already been covered even though very very different industries. So it will be very interesting to convert notes afterwards. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to talk a little bit about what we call the connected company, the data connected company and the journey we've been on with Palantir. Making the world more resilient is at the heart of what we do. It gives us a real purpose and as I'll discuss today data is adding new possibilities to do that. Swiss Re established in 1863 there was a huge fire, destroyed a town called Glarris in Switzerland and that clearly showed that insurance alone is inadequate. In simple terms, reinsurance is insurance for insurers. Today we're one of the world's leading reinsurers and you can see some of the information on the slides behind me here. We literally cover millions of risks, some of the topics this morning are very relevant to us and in over 100 jurisdictions around the world. In addition to reinsurance we have specialist insurance solutions in particular for our corporate clients and one of our goals would be to move beyond insurance and into a world of risk insights which I'll talk to shortly. Just a couple of examples to try and make it real. Recently you will have seen in Florida this is enormous hurricane, Hurricane Ian. It is not a good time to be called Ian. In the insurance industry I can tell you I'm responsible for billions of losses but huge damage to lives, property, massive losses for the industry. The reality is the small insurers in Florida would not have been able to cover those losses without reinsurance, exactly like in Glarris or those years ago. Generally small insurers want to grow their businesses, if they hand off risk to reinsurers they can grow their businesses. Other examples you can look at building projects, if you want to build a skyscraper that would typically exceed the risk capacity of any insurance company again, reinsurance can help. There's many, many examples of where we as a risk company get involved with our clients and look to make the world more resilient. We consider ourselves to be a risk knowledge company. What do I mean by that? Why? Not only do we see every type of risk across the world but we actually assess it and we put a value on it and we put it on our balance sheet. The dynamics of our balance sheet is extremely complicated if you consider the number of enforced risks that switch reruns. Also insurance companies and rein insurance companies are also investors, right? The fundamental things that we do is we have to invest the premiums, we receive to pay out claims in the future which can be very, very far in the future. Financial market risks are highly relevant for insurers, equity, credit, inflation, interest rate and so on. Essentially we look at the world through the lens of risk. Our job is to understand it, to find ways to cover it and to mitigate it. What sets us apart from a typical insurer is diversification across all of these risks globally. It's just central to our business model. You can't hedge these risks. You diversify and this will help profitability over time but from a data point of view it leads to fragmentation. Diversification of risk is good for business, it's not so good for data. Increasingly simply ensuring risks is no longer sufficient. We see complicated things, cyber risks, inflation, what the cause is, what that's doing to society, climate change, longevity, really having a profound impact on how we live. And insurance is only one tool. So we need to move beyond that. We need to do more and this is where data and insights can really help. So to achieve our mission we need to broaden our services by increasingly combining human expertise and real data and state-of-the-art analytics to understand the risk better. We can provide additional services to our clients and society. So as I start coming on to data and data connectivity I want to talk about fragmentation. Fragmentation is a real challenge in insurers and possibly some of the other businesses we've heard today. I would say it's the default natural state of an insurance company, at least to date. As mentioned we have three businesses. Each of these businesses, their own CEO, their own executive committee, we have an investment decision that likewise set up. They all want their own data and they all want it in the way that they want to see it. But then so does the group. I mentioned we are in over a hundred jurisdictions, what that actually means is that we have individual, legally regulated insurance and reinsurance companies in those countries that have their own board, that want their own data and so forth. And then the other one which I think is a little orthogonal is the contract itself. Like one of the key products of an insurance company is the contract that we produce between ourselves and the client. These contracts are massively complicated. Often reinsurance treaties, commercial insurance policies, many, many hundreds of pages, all of them, many of them very bespoke. We have millions of treaties and policies. And the question is, does the data that's in your system really represent what's in that policy? And we know about technologies like NLP and so on, but they're still nascent and have limited impact on supporting this. So when I talk about a connected company, I'm really talking about gaining mastery over all of this data that represents swissery and then joining it up so it makes sense from any needed perspective. So whether I want to look at an individual line of business or a policy or a client perspective or a particular portfolio, I want to be able to pick the company up, twist it around and find the answer that I need. What we did at swissery is we defined a data strategy around six fundamental pillars. The first one is it starts with the business. It has to start with the business. It can't start with the IT or the tech. What are the business needs? Where is it going? How does data fit in? We make the business leaders make the call. It shapes everything else. And the other thing that we do is in our different units, they're free to set these priorities and how they do this themselves. We have a common framework so we can then join up across the group. We need good foundations. Make the data discoverable, know what we have, good architecture design, data models which represent our business, good plans for shared master data and so forth. Crucially, we have to advance our governance capabilities at the same rate as we accelerate our ability to use and analyze the data. The workforce, the culture. We need not only upskill the workforce but we need to change the mindset of many traditional thinking staff and this is not an easy thing to do. It has to be a priority. Analytics, we need to position these new advanced analytic capabilities, data science and so on alongside the traditional ones that we have. Insurance companies are full of very smart. Analytical people, actuaries, quants and so forth and how do these things coexist, what techniques should we use at that's also a focus. And then finally the technology itself and this is when we finally come to the foundry which is at the heart of our data strategy. So how do we do it? How do we really make the connected company and this has been an interesting journey for us and you can see on the slide behind me about a third of the company is now active user of the foundry. The journey was in three stages and I'd like to say it was by design but it wasn't but looking back I could make the argument we went this way but it is a very, very good evolution. We started with use cases. Like a real problem that has a huge impact on the company and we had several very good successors together with Palantir but then it became clear that this fragmentation challenge was limiting us. Did we really have mastery of our own data? So the next thing that we had to do was to connect. So you give the individual business the most important information it needs to run itself to steer itself. So we move away from these historical IT siloed organized data worlds to a single what we call analytical data model. An analytical data model is a single representation of our businesses data. So all of the users pricing actualies, observing actualies, underwriters, people talking to clients are looking at the same data at the same time. People in the business using the data directly so we'll have people using Palantir Foundry who are business people who are being trained up. People have our own technology data science experts and then we have colleagues at Palantir. So really upskilling the workforce. We've done this now in our major business areas or we are in the process, some are more advanced than others. The next step is can we really connect across the company? Can we truly create a data connected company at the group level? And we believe we can and we've built one of these analytical data models in each major part and we've been working on designing what we call a logical data model which is essentially the common language to go across a different part of the company. And it's clear for all to see and we move away from this hidden operationally difficult to manage semi-connected environment. We've got to be pragmatic. It's super hard to do this. So what we did is we started with problems that the company needed to solve. If we make this a theoretical architecture exercise, it will fail. And finally going back to making the world more resilient, this is the opportunity to go beyond insurance and think about insights. What about data connectivity for the wider world? With Palantir we're building a risk data services market neutral platform that will enable clients to see their risks using swissery insights or they could use insights from any other provider and then choose to publish that on the platform. This is a really exciting step in our goal to wake them.
