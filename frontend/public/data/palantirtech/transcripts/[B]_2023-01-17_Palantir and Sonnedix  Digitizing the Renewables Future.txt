The Sonatics is at the forefront of the renewables revolution any moment that we're not producing clean energy Means more time rely on force of use. We're trying to do things differently leveraging our data intelligence in parenting foundry to power strategic decision-making and push the energy transition forward We're gathering data from across multiple business units, continents and even the stratosphere We throw 100 solar tracker farms across the globe often located in remote areas regular and targeted maintenance can be extremely difficult and complex With foundry we're able to integrate disparate data sources from the wetter production time series satellite images and Models of course into one single source of truth made of different objects known as the foundry ontology Digital twin of our assets break down the site into different components the solar trackers the inverters and the modules This allow our different teams to collaborate across a common platform and to capture different decisions and actions at the object level So that we can monitor performance optimize maintenance and take actions in real time Being able to join all our data stream via the ontology allow us to model complex scenario that previously Where inaccessible to us once the ontology is defined increasing the number of individual objects and the data stream associated to those object is essentially effortless Our trackers rotate to much the direction of the sun at times they can get stuck on they can have component issues Which resulting in downtime and of course such underperformance and in the worst case scenario severe damages to the components using Palantirs met a constellation software we able to monitor solar fields under percent remotely with commercial satellite imagery and machine learning models Those models automatically detect misaligned trackers in it of maintenance Then leveraging the digital twin we can remotely monitor our assets and not only detect under performance But also understand what is the root cause of that underperformance and the financial impact associated the system alert us when a tracker is Misaligned and so we can take action and send a team directly to the precise location to the exact tracker on site and Executement from the earlier results of this use case We're confident we can beat our goal of reducing the revenue losses associated to tracker failures by at least 20% Also to reduce to zero catastrophic mechanical failures due to tracker being stuck in a vertical position under strong wind We Now have immediate notification when a problem arises with the solar tracker for example Which has severely reduced idle time between identification of a problem and resolution by a needed repairs with the ability To monitor our trackers remotely now We don't need to make long drives out to the fields to conduct maintenance checks So we are also reducing our carbon footprint and our teams are responding a lot faster and work in a lot smarter way than they used to do in the past As a world transitions to renewable energy sources our goal is to implement foundry through all areas of the company So our teams can rely on real-time data and fully integrated tools to make critical business decisions around producing clean energy So
