Good evening everyone. My name is Gabriel Dombach and I lead the growth commercial PMO for Johnson Controls in Emea. I'm joining you today from beautiful Switzerland and I want to show you how we are reshaping our 140 year old company. So we are a world leader for smart buildings. That means that we create safe, healthy and sustainable places. And our customers are commercial and industrial building owners and operators, think of offices, hotels, data centers, schools, universities and airports. And many of those are truly mission critical to society. And actually because of this pretty iconic location here, we are also a key supplier to the US Navy. So we provide a truck fire and security solutions to ships like this. It also happens that we have the world's largest portfolio in building technologies. And with that comes a lot of complexity. So what you see in the back end is our enterprise operating system. You can see that the agent is running, is mapping data, is adding location IDs together with assets. Another agent is crafting a value proposition for that specific asset. And this automation of our lifecycle covers literally everything from production to installation to maintenance. And the actual power of this is automation first. So we actually reimagine the way we do the process so that it adapts to automation first. And what you see on top is the key metrics that we care about. And they are actually very simple. The first one is the dollar value we generate with this. The second one, and that is a crucial one for us, it's the conversion rate from lead to opportunity. And it really shows the quality and the effectiveness of everything we do. The third one is the number of leads you can see. So it's 180,000. But actually that's the twofolded numbers. So one thing we do is we create leads looking into the history in the actions with our customers that have not happened. But the second thing we do is we actually create leads looking into the future. So in other words, what we have here is the key to build the future pipeline for our salespeople. And in only 18 months we have actually increased with this project our lead to opportunity conversion rate by 5x. And now I want to show you how we have digitalized the lifecycle. So it all starts with mapping the data. You see about 200 data sources, ERPs, service tools, SaaS tools. It all comes into one place. We have the entire region mapped out. And the reason why we do this is because we need to make the data visible, to make it accessible, and then usable. So we dive into it and what you see is the accessible part of the data. So we have our deployed items, our customer contracts, we have addresses, locations, LNM's, it's all there. And on the far right you have the agents which are grabbing the clean, structured data and they use that to automate the process. Now how do we identify those leads? Well on the left you see that we take all our product lifecycle knowledge and we code it into Foundry. So we have an example here of a fire panel that has no maintenance contracts. So there is an upsell opportunity. We can ask also Foundry questions like show me the customers that have smoked it, that does which are obsolete because we want to replace them. I can ask Foundry make me a campaign of all the customers that have a license, a software license which needs an upgrade so I can sell them an upgrade. And we also partner with our salespeople. And that's actually really crucial because if you think of our sales people that have 20, 30, 40 years of experience at some point they leave the company, they retire, they change positions, and we take all that knowledge and we make actionable rules out of it. And that's actually critical to us because this tribal knowledge is this way preserved and we can leverage across the entire organization. What is even more powerful is because we can decide the type of leads. We want our salespeople to focus on. We tell the system, focus on deals with the higher margins or we can tell the system focus on deals that have more volume. And we can predict for every single lead the individual customer conversion rate. That's like a remote control for your business because you steer the business into the direction you want to. And through that engine we have encoded over 100,000 leads at this point. Now if I dive into one lead I can see that AIP has already mapped out the seven steps fully automatically. It has mapped the individual asset. It has understood the customer journey. It makes sense of some kind of physical evidence, a service technician that was on site, took pictures. The pictures go into the ontology. Again, this circular process is starting. The data is being reused. And AIP has now generated an individual value proposition. And we want to ship that lead to a seller. But AIP is pausing and is asking a human operator to interact. Because AIP has understood that it's a specific customer situation. Where we have one customer with two buildings. In one building we have a chiller with a maintenance contract. In the next building we have a security device. There is no maintenance contract. So now AIP is giving the human operator the chance to say, hey, don't do you want to give him a special condition, a special offer. So that actually this second device that has no maintenance contract will be impackaged in the first maintenance contract. It's better for the business, it's better for the customer. The operator takes the information, keys it in and sends it out. The system will select the best sales channel to execute the lead. Account managers, insert sales, service technicians. And every technician is becoming a trusted advisor for our customers. So they do not just longer maintain equipment. They are actually now proactive. They are predictive. So they come to the customer and say, hey, Mr. customer, I'm here for my routine maintenance. But actually my iPad has shown me that your building is in critical conditions because of a couple of assets. Let me walk you through that. That's the type of conversation we want to have with our customers. And it is really exciting to see that once you have all this data mapped out, there's really no limit to anything. So we have deployed this same human AI partnering across the entire organization. Now we are doing it in procurement. We have AIP that is scanning, spanning patterns and surfacing cost opportunities, cost saving opportunities throughout the organization. We are picking those opportunities and we are driving them into an automated RFQ workflow end-to-end. And it is really incredible to see that you can transform a 140-year-old company with the power of AI. Thank you.
