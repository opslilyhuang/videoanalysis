TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The kid was Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, a joyous New Year, and a happy holiday to everyone celebrating. We have a talent here, are deeply grateful for your support, your generosity. We know how courageous many of you have to be to support us in public and in private. While we attempt to support the war fighters and others who do deeply important and often a dangerous thing to secure our way of life that undergird the superior out of the West, we believe talentiers are metaphor for the splendor in artistry and discipline necessary to build great things, what has made the West great over thousands of years. In one of the reasons I do this video on Cross Country's King is it's a very similar analogy. You train and train and train to get your VO2 Max work at work. You train the technique, you train strength, you train all year while everyone is having fun. You're just training and sleeping and training and working and then you get to enjoy the splendor of gliding across the snow, gliding uphill, suspending gravity. In many ways that's what Palantir did in the last couple of years. We suspended the gravity that was apparently the viscosity that was going to hold down the true greatness of our ability to make institutions especially in the West stronger, better, more secure. Make American and other workers better in their job, raise their pricing parity. Make American soldiers, war fighters, deadlier, safer, protect data. Do these things that are cornerstone to the West. We could not have done it without your help and we are deeply grateful and hope every single one of you who supported us has a wonderful and joyous holiday. Thank you for all your help.
