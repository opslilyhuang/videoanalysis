TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm very focused. We're very focused on things that make institutions run better, work better. By the way, work doesn't mean taking out terrorists without data protection. It means solving both problems. Delivering PPE, delivering masks, delivering vaccines, while protecting data, while making sure it's actually fair and just, it doesn't go just to the wealthy that you can actually have a transparent system. And why are we focused on that? Because I believe that actual creation of value is actually what underscores and underpins democracy.
