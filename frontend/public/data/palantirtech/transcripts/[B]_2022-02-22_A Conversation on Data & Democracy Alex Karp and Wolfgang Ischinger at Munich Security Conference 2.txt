TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Welcome to this conversation about data and democracy, and I'm sure a number of other issues. I should confess at the outset, I'm probably the least qualified moderator for this. But I'm eager to learn, and I know I have someone here with me who knows everything about these complex issues. Alex Carp, of course, is known as the Mr. Palantir. He has done other things before, but he's the man behind or in front of Palantir as a enormously innovative company that has also created headlines and attracted enormous interest. And it is exactly, but not only about issues that have to do with protecting our countries, defending our countries, but also defending our private values, our privacy rights, at the possible dilemma, dilemma-ta that are contained in this. So I would welcome all those. This is one of the last events in this conference, in an hour or so, we'll all go to lunch and conclude the conference. But I'm really pleased that we were able to include this. So Alex, I don't think I need to read your entire CV here. You're known. The one thing that distinguishes Alex Carp from other transatlantic personalities, other Americans who have an interest in Europe is actually that he spent quite a bit of time at the University of Frankfurt and actually got, if my information is correct, actually got a PhD as an doctor in Frankfurt, above and beyond his other degrees from Stanford and his college degree. So that's unusual. I don't know anyone else in my network who actually took one of these leftist seminars at the Neue Frankfurt Schule. That's really quite amazing. So a very warm welcome to you, Alex. This is not supposed to be, you know, an seminar where Dr. Carp speaks and you guys listen. This is supposed to be a discussion. So if you wish to intervene and offer comments or questions to Alex, just feel free to make yourself seen or use the electronic chat room function, which I have the tablet here in front of me and I already have two questions. So I'm looking forward to active participation. I can promise that we can deal with all the questions but we'll do our best. So Alex, maybe just to offer you a chance to get us kicked off, tell us a little bit about how you personally deal with, I mean, you tell us what the objectives are for your company and how do you deal with this question of on the one hand, the technology that you have developed and you're developing designed to help law enforcement and many other institutions to gather and interpret data and this dilemma which I try to describe, which some people are worried about concerning their own privacy rights, et cetera. Alex. Well, I'm happy to be here and just to comment. Firstly, you don't know anyone who studied philosophy in Germany because the rest of my colleagues were mostly as a past unemployment and, you know, it may not exactly be in your circles. And I have known you over the years and I've admired your work and I would say if we were half as good at being ambassadors as you are, we would be even more successful. So maybe we'll make a good team because we're not ambassadors. But you know that the, you know, it's interesting. Tech and the reception of tech is very jurisdictional. So you really can't talk about the global reception to data and use of software. If you just take England, America and Germany as examples, the constitutional frameworks are very, very different. In England, you don't have a right of privacy. You do have a right to not be prosecuted with the data. In America, you have a right of privacy. But it's very much on a civil liberties advocacy background where the civil liberties and the advocacy advocacy out there are pretty equally weighted depending on the period you're in. And in Germany, you have the home of dot and shorts. And it's very easy. There's an Anglo-American way at looking at German law, which is to assume dot and shorts is grafted on to German law and culture post-World War II. It's actually not really true. And it is in the form of the way, which it's treated, is very much part of German philosophy and goes back to a root of assuming that there is a right as to have ownership over something that is really much like a product without going off courses. It's kind of epistemological. It's something that exists as a value independent of societal perspectives, which is a very Germanic way of viewing things and is not the same as you would find in France, which is a different tradition. And in the Anglo sphere, it's a varied. And these are traditions I think that one could agree equally, but definitely protect a civil liberty. So the reception of software and technologies is very different. So if you just take some form in Germany, what I would call a Germanic perspective, there is great skepticism about what could be viewed as violations of your private sphere, which already doesn't translate well into English. And the law, but as importantly, the law, the cultural reception to products that would allow you to do things like surveil people, is there's a great deal of worry. And I would also say there's a worry that Germany is an export nation. Most of the great products of the world that one uses in other areas are heavily influenced by the German economy. And so Germany mostly imports products from itself at home. So if you're living in Germany, most of the products you have in your home, your architecture, your car, without you being particularly pro-German, are going to be German. This isn't the case in software, which is very much dominated by American companies. Now, the American version is it's dominated by companies from the West Coast, but I think that gets lost in translation. So you have a weird convergence of skepticism towards what it would mean. Part of it is partly obviously historical, both West and East Germany and, you know, Diefegangenheit Deutschlands. But it's actually not, in my view, it's something that has a positive philosophical trend that we've threw that, and then you have a cultural reception. And so there's a great deal of skepticism, and then the company's doing this not just mine, but that are winning are from America, which also has a certain kind of bikishmuck, which is not always an advantage. There are very legitimate issues here, like in Germany, actually very much more personally, and conceive of these things in a way that you find in the European Union, but of how do you protect your right to have a private area that's your own as an asset, which is very much, it's not just in the, there's another distinction between America and say, Angus here, in German culture, people really want that in their personal life and in relation to government. So the American view of this protects you from the government, it doesn't protect you from a consumer internet company, and that's cultural and legal. So there's great specificity about what has to be delivered. I would say, and there is clear, and we'll get it as I want to take the whole time on this one question, but you know, in whose, how has this been doing, being done, who's doing it, where's the data going, who controls the data, is it transparent, is the data something I own and manage or not, converges with fantasies of how this could be abused. And in my view, so that's kind of my left wing side, but you know, Palantir has always been involved in finding the data and protecting civilizat. So on the kind of more realist side, but it can't be the case that because of that, you can't find people who are involved in criminal, serious criminal behavior or involvement terrorism or are going to war with you or these things require the use of data. So Palantir's view is you do both, and I'll leave a deeper rendering of the question to questions. Well, thanks a lot already. I mean, this raises a whole bunch of questions, and I already have a couple of them. So you know, get into the game if you wish to. I mean, we have this catch-but in the European Union discussions about the EU being or the European Union being about to become quote unquote a regulatory superpower. I think this is one of the things that many, some of us believe is a great asset. We're going to be the regulatory superpower that dominates in that sense, global standards. So my question to you is, does this approach, the regulatory superpower ambition, to what extent, in your view, does this hinder? To what extent is it an obstacle to the use of innovative technologies in our markets, in our societies? Is it also possible that it could provide benefits to us? So tell us a little bit how you think about this regulatory system in the EU, which of course is quite different as I understand from what you're facing in the US. Well, the classic answer from almost every tech person in the world is it's going to hurt you and don't do it. And I'm sure there's lobbyists in Brussels lobbying against us every day. In full disclosure, the more Europe pushes great, no standards, the better it is for my company. And what I care about personally morally, but again, I think it's important to always kind of put your, you know, your self interest is, is it going to be regulation that is enforced by a neutral party, which, you know, honestly, I would support as a company or personally, because I think, A, that's the way to do it. There's some reasons why that's crucial in the national defense context, which is that the West does build in enterprise software by far the best software, but you have massive procurement issues like the people who decide who gets what gets perfured may prefer ancient software that, you know, is built by a local provider. And now, by the way, I don't mean that primarily in regard to Europe, but like we had to battle through the integrators in America, none of them wanted the best software. Right? So we want neutral adjudication of strict standards. It would caution that neutral adjudication, though, means it has to be neutral adjudication. You know, it's like if you have, as an example, you know, pure data protection people are skeptical of, volunteer, great. Let's see neutral adjudication. If it's about skeptical of me because I disagree with you politically, that's not going to work. But what I would really like to see both for moral and particularistic reasons is I think it's a great idea. And then you get to the technical thing. Will it hurt or help? I think, you know, what the West needs to do to win these things is to raise the standard of competence so high that you have both moral and technological superiority. And then the question you always get is, well, how do you do that? Well, in software, and I can't speak to other industries, software is a magical business which has certain ethical challenges because the magic can only be done by very few people and they end up with all the money. So that's a real issue for our societies that has to be dealt with, in my view, through some form of redistribution. But it is a magical industry because the people who can do these things are going to be inspired by high ethical and high technology challenges. And you actually do better. I mean, pound my companies, an example. We know if someone came to us and said, hey, we want to find the terrorists and we don't care what you do with the data, we didn't hire them. And that's why we have my humble opinion, the best products in the world. And that's exactly a European approach. So I very much support it. But the one thing that's a caveat is Europe is weak in software. So if you're going to do this for cars and chemicals and clothes and everything else, you got to do it for software. And so that's something that has to be, and by the way, now's the moment to do it because there's a very strong working relationship between Europe and America. And this will be co-beneficial. But if it's slippage where we apply strict standards to cars and chemicals and clothes and things that notoriously Europe is good at, but suddenly in software, we don't have equal standards, you'll find that that's not going to work. And so very much supportive of this, but equal, I would honestly go to Switzerland. You know, I understand this. I would get some authority that is super obviously neutral. It's like we are all going on data. We are all going to conform to these standards. If you do not conform to these standards, whether you're from America, Taiwan, Israel, or Germany, your software cannot be used. If you do, I don't want to hear what someone's political baggage is. To the same way, we don't ask in America when I'm buying a BMW. Yeah, I don't know what it's like. So it has to be absolutely neutral. And by the way, it applies to America, it applies it. Other obviously restriction security services, for example, will need different kinds of, like for example, when we deliver software to, despite what one may read, almost every intel service in Europe, not every intel service. And of course, when we deliver the software, it gets checked and they look for things about God bless them. They should look for ever. That's their job. You know, there's an absolute neutrality. Germany, by the way, is uniquely positioned to pull, to push this because, well, there's the financial reason, which is, it's an absolutely in the interest of every German because, how does Germany, Germany's an export country? It relies on open markets. Without open markets, Germany's economy will not work. Everybody in business knows that here. And to have open economies, you're going to have to have standards because the parties that you're shipping to don't like each other. And then, but Germany is uniquely positioned as a, of the large countries. It's the only one that's plausibly neutral. And everyone associates Germany with a high level of competence and certain kinds of rigor. True or not, this is just the cultural association. And so it's going to, it will be, there's, there's always the action and the appearance of the action. So for example, a pound here, I love data protection. I want it to be enforced everywhere. I want it to be enforced neutral. I want, I don't want to have a political discussion about what we think politically, who someone in my company supported. I want to talk about data protection. And then we want a neutral adjudicator and hub. But then there's a question of do people believe that? Most people, many people don't believe me. Great. But I don't care if they believe me. I know what the facts are. Well, it depends on how you adjudicate. If you adjudicate on the facts, it's not great. It's great. If you adjudicate. And there I think Germany has a very, also I would say something Germans underestimate is just, you know, the largest immigrant population in America still are Germans. They're just like Germany has a very positive reputation globally. Realistic, everyone knows German history. But I would say outside of Germany, the Germans and the diaspora are more positive about Germany, the inside Germany. And as you know, as a Bolshevlar, it's like an amazing asset. By the way, here I'm including Austria, Lieschenstein, Dysvijitz. It's not just... Exactly. Laura would terminate her contract with parliamentier if you didn't do that. I'm looking around the room for any first questions that are coming up. Stefan Götz, please. I mean, the problem for Germany in this moment is that we have been setting industrial standards over a long period of time. But it was because we were masters of those industries. That's why we could set the standards. We cannot do that because we're not masters of software. We have a lot of B2B solutions now in Germany. There's actually a whole host of things, but it's kind of all relatively technical and specific purpose-specific. We don't have the broad competence that would give us the chance to build standards as we did in the past. So, they're parts that I obviously agree with that Germany is and was... Whatever, it's not dominant in every industry, but anything involving metals, chemical. There's a long list where, and even when you look at the companies that aren't German, somehow they have like Germanic names in America. So, I don't quite agree on the data. I do think, yes, it's going to be a give and take. You can't just have standards where you're winning. That are not standards. That's called being smart. That's just different. And you want to have standards where you just... You'll notice there'll be a lot of pushback. I mean, this isn't my area, but like in when you're negotiating complicated treaties, you got to find a standard that both people can live with, by which is a standard. And by the way, maybe Germany is the best of software tomorrow and that's different. I do think Germany or Europe has laid out a lot of ideas about data protection, which in my view, or by the way, the ideas we conceived of in our product 20 years ago. So I happen to share these ideas. What are those ideas? Who does the data belong to under what conditions? What is the province of the data? Where's the data processed? Who has legal rights to the province of that data? Is it Germany or is it Palo Alto? Is it the US authorities because it gets processed in Palo Alto? Or is it the European authorities? Is there a distinction between data and processing? How do you prove the security model? Can that be proofs in a transparent way? How long does the data get held? One of the things that American civil libertarians prefer is that you can't get rid of the data because if you can get rid of the data, then maybe you could do weird things on the data and purge it. Germany in general, Europe sees that differently. They want you to purge the data because they want to have a personal life. I'm much more on the European side here personally, and our product allows you to do those things, which is why it's been very successful in Europe. So I do think Germany, Europe does have a very unique way of conceiving the policy. And yes, we will all have to live with those things. But there is just, you could say, you know, one of my, it's not exactly related, but one of my favorite quotes from victimist, Enregal Fogosugga, Almisnistein, Enregal Sufogum. So believing you're following a rule is not following a rule. You got to follow the rule. And by the way, right now, for lots of geopolitical reasons, one of the things I learned at this conference, many things is American Europe is working very well together. You want to get these things done? Get them done now. One of the things you learn in business, if you succeed is you don't have time to wait. You have an opportunity for a lot of reasons, mostly bad people like each other again. You want to wait till people don't like each other again? To get the rules to work, they're not going to work. They will work now. I have a couple of questions on my tablet, so let me use the technology here. Is Monika, Emma, in the room? She's asked the question. So if he's not in the room, I'm going to ask her a question. And I think you referred to that problem already. Question is this, do you have a good proposal how to allow for neutral adjudication, slash control of software, slash algorithms by authorities? Well, again, I can tell you how to do this. Lots of people got to do this. I don't think that's the problem. You need, there's reality and perception to get this to work. They have to converge. You could use Paladir. We could do a very good job of this. That's not what you want. You need a neutral adjudicator. It should be, in my view, part of a non-avocacy culture. So I would just go to the obviously most neutral people and make sure those people, by the way, in this has to be, this has to go under enormous scrutiny. You cannot have people from a company that are somehow going to go back to that company evaluating the standards. So it's like, and this happens, by the way, as another question, it's like, people always ask me, we maybe get this, but like, what is the West going to do in the AI race with China, which is always the question, right? So, but they're very much linked. The West, especially America, and that hopefully will change. I really think Germany needs to focus on changing this and France doing a lot, but some things I would do differently in making sure that tomorrow is not like today, where the strongest software companies all come from a tiny patch in America. But the procurement is crucial. It's like, if you leave it up to entrenched actors, whether it's me or your local industry or whatever, to decide what the best software is, you're going to find loan behold is their software. So it's like, you have to have, it's both the standards. I think people could agree to the standards pretty quickly. They're already, but then who adjudicates this. And then that's got to be something where when you lose, you know, you lost. You didn't lose because the person is trying to get people to buy. So that's the credibility issue. Honestly, that question is much more better addressed to you than me. I don't know who exactly those people were, but I bet you, if you, if you, and other sat down said, this is someone I would believe if they gave me an answer I disagree with. That's always the crucial thing. Who would you believe if they gave you an answer you thought was wrong? Well, you're not going to believe me. Okay, I, I happen to know where they're on right or up, but you don't know that. But there are people where you're like, okay, I believe that person believes that they're telling the truth. And it has to be a group of people like that. And they do exist in the world. They can be found. And they want to do this because it's the most crucial thing for your culture, our culture. And that is like the single most important answer to a lot of these questions. And it doesn't really exist currently. It exists in various forms and various countries. So please. Ken. Excuse me. All right. I'm I can't bother from human rights watch. I know. Who knows who you are? I wanted to kind of go back to basics in terms of not data protection, but you know, who owns the data to begin with. And I mean, go have this philosophical because you've been speaking philosophically. The US in my impression kind of got off on the wrong foot from like the chocolate egg era. I mean, I used to be a prosecutor in a former life. And I was a former life. Okay. That's a unique interpretation of what you do for a living. All right. Fair enough. I used to, there was something called pen registers in the old days, which, which said that I could just, you know, without any warrant, get the phone numbers that somebody dialed. I couldn't, you know, I couldn't listen to the phone conversation without a warrant, but I could get the numbers they dialed because the dialers shared the number with the phone company. That was the rationale. Therefore, there was no right to privacy. And that, you know, old fashioned exception where, you know, the FBI agent would have to follow up one by one on each call. And so there was actual practical limit to how much your privacy could be invaded. Has just been, you know, a massive hole blown through it because it's going to all be done automatically with computers. And this data, which is all shared with the internet company, can completely reconstruct your life. And in fact, that's sort of the basis of what surveillance capital is mis right now. It's the basis of your company that you, you collect all this data. It's not a basis of my company. That part for all of the data. Fair enough. Okay, fair enough. So my question really is, do we need to kind of reconceptualize practically what the right to privacy means in this modern world where, in no longer, you know, consider this data shared just because I happen to, you know, punch in something into a search engine or, or, you know, visit a website. You know, should I genuinely own my data, you know, not in a kind of, you know, only if I can figure out at the bottom of all the waivers, is the right thing to check. But just presumptively, it's my data unless I very consciously give it to your company, or some other company. There's a lot I agree with the gist of the question. And with great respect to the question, which I think, and what you're intending to ask, it's not asked precisely enough to give you the right answer. So let me reformulate the question so that you get a technical version. See, you're putting a couple things together, which is what is exactly right philosophically. There's been a move from what I would call a nodal society to a network society, where when you, when the FBI or whatever authorities were getting the access to phone numbers, that was ethically somehow understandable, leading the law side, because in fact, they were getting access to the numbers. They weren't getting access to you. When you move to a network society, in fact, the network of your behaviors is actually you. Like you can know more about the network than the person knows about themselves. So no to network. And this happened where you are right technically is that insight does power the way in which you do certain security. So for example, if you in cyber, if you want to know who's going where, where's the data? Who's robbing you that you look at the network? You don't look at the node. You figure out the node by looking at the network. You're then imposing that onto software companies in general. And that's where it goes a little wrong. And so for example, you're taking consumer and enterprise and putting them into one bucket, where in fact, and merging distinctions that are different in America and in Europe. So in Europe, you would be protected in consumer and government interactions equal. So you have data protection as a consumer and as a, in your interaction with government, somewhat equal. It's not the same. Obviously if you are involved in criminal behavior, they can see the data. And you're using the ownership to, by the way, I happen to agree with you on that. Like, but it's a very subtle thing in the consumer space. Since you've signed up to give it to a consumer, I happen to think one of the reasons why we've been very critical of consumers, they de facto are making you into product. They're monetizing your data and then you're getting nothing. And in fact, they do know more about you than you know about yourself. And they're in not only that, they're influencing who you are, which is has enormous political problems for democracies, which in my view, you see on extremes left and right. You might just think on the right, I think, and both. But, but and then you're imposing that onto what we just completely separate thing because, in fact, in enterprise, there are various things, but in general, in enterprise, like in my case, we have, we don't own the data, we don't collect the data, we don't keep the data, we do process the data. So now you could say a version of being critical if you accepted that architecture, which would be even a harder question is, yeah, but you don't have to own the data. If in fact, your interaction with the data is so powerful that you get to the same place. Now there you're doing in a moral distinction on top of a legal distinction. You can argue that I can't anything that you need to look at both. But in Europe and in European law, there's a difference between the data owner and the data processor. And this is a big distinction, just like in American law, there's a distinction between access to the data and moving the data. You could call it academic and we could litigate that and I'm not on either side, but that's just the way it is. And I think both makes sense. Both have huge weaknesses. What you're getting at though, are two things I broadly very much agree with. Yes, I don't know if you can call it data, data ownership when you get to an anti-terror legal context where you have certain rights to get access to the data. But there should be a great deal of skepticism and rigor about what you're doing with the data, even when you to use your model move from I own the data to I have a warrant. The police have a warrant can look at it precisely because of the assumption of your question, which is that in pen testing, pen, pen actual looking at these numbers, it's not super powerful. Whereas when the police get your or the surveillance state gets your as you get they actually can have insights into your movement, your data, your personal life. Is it really necessary for the government to know who you actually see and what you're doing with them, unless you're like some severe criminal. And then where I would say I'm very much on the advocacy side of this would be if I were a personal person, people outside the company don't always believe me, people inside the company know this is true is well, you you're saying basically to people trust me. But no one trusts large industry or government, certainly not America, actually in Europe it's different people trust. But in any case, then you get to the verification. So when you move to this, you need there's a distinction that the primary distinction in my view is under what circumstances would broader society believe it's okay to move to hyper powerful techniques. So I would say most people society are okay with warrant based hyper power techniques against terror suspects. And most people do not want this against normal criminals, meaning you're stealing a piece of bread or or they're being a slippage. So like what happens when they're still running this program. I mean, this is the classic migration thing. It starts with the terrorist and all of a sudden it's the political. And so that's again where I would say you like the way this works is people like you and me who would broadly probably disagree on a lot of issues. I assume we might agree quite a bit on how you actually get these things to work technically. And if we agreed and we are like I trust that third party to enforce our agreement, you might find the world is a lot better place because in fact technically and by the way you could say well, is this guy just mad. I would tell you is commercially my interest because I know we can do this and I know that the one thing I would say that typically advocates, which I respect on your end, should often underestimate is how technically difficult it is to do what is ethically correct. This what you're describing. Honestly, I don't know any other company that can do that part of reasons why advocate for it. But it's very, very, very and what I would call it is a distinction between the is a broad in position on the data of an ownership category where the rebuttal presumption to use a legal term is that you own the data and to take the shift the rebuttal switch the rebuttal presumption you need a high standard of scrutiny that always gets scrutinized. I kind of suspect you and I agree on that. Okay, so now that has to be enforced and that there you need technical specificity and you need an enforcement engine and that by the way is going to have to be done in the West globally with some modification. There are real differences in how America, Germany, England see this. But the commonality is what you outlined and that can be achieved. All right. Any question for you? Sure. Please go ahead. I have a much more profane question. Your private business has been increasing a lot. Awesome. Europe. And I wonder how can we increase the competitiveness of European companies in the usage of AI and in the usage of integrated data. What are the prerequisites to make them more competitive and other disadvantages to date due to the regulatory framework for European companies in using, for example, your products, but also to use more advanced products that are to come. Well, there's a lot of questions in there and they're super important. I would just disambiguate it into two of those. It's like, how could Europe be more competitive on the tech scene and then how can Europe adapt adopt technology is quicker and like it. And so I'll give you the more palatable version and then what I actually think is more interesting is just how what can Europe do because, you know, to the points here Europe lives, forget your Germany lives from having the best products people buy German products because they believe, in any case, I believe German products are among the best in the world and not just the raw tech version of it, but they somehow weave technology into a kind of moral standard of competence. It's very powerful and and then there's how can you adopt you do have this issue America is just is a very, very, in my view, there are issues with over advocacy and one of the reasons I like these standards beyond that are just not how it's related is that I think I think the hyper advocacy culture of America. It's very pleasant to be sometimes we back in Germany. It's just like everything has to be avic litigated and it's like it's it's like everything it's like there are there are something like facts that exist also but it's like it's much more hyper advocacy and you know, but America is just more adaptive in adopting new things and technology that works is new and is built for tomorrow and deliver today America just it's a massive advantage. And then in the so there I think on the enterprise side adopting things is just building different adoption ports into your company that are more willing to do things that look odd, you know, and you know technology that is different and new does look odd to people who build it don't look normal. We are just that's just a different world and in Europe has to be will learn to be better at that because the other industries are so strong and they know this is a commonly known thing on building a tech community here. You know, it's I you know I often get in trouble for this but you know spend less bring the people over here many of us are have like you know some European but Suks are open. I don't know why like you know there's a great German texting it's one of the best in the world in fact it might be the best in the world. It's just in powellton Canada. It's not here. Now and I it's like this should be the highest priority priority for every European official. And I I won't mention names but I've in my you know pound chairs like I often think we're like the partner on the side you don't acknowledge because I like I end up talking almost everyone in private. But and I've told all these people want to know the pound chair agenda which I probably spend more time I tell them basically I don't put it this way because I'm trying to be polite well how many of the Titans from your country that I all know have you talked to in the last year. But don't like why aren't they living in your country. Why do I know them in the diaspora. You know and then it's like well I don't agree with this person politically or there are an arrogant blah blah blah might all be true. But you know what if your economy depends on this you'll talk to some people you don't like the minute people people it's like your future depends on these people and they are from your culture they speak often speak your language. They're building you know we have German terms at Palantir that Americans can't pronounce they run around saying them about how do you build a company. I mean it's crazy that like there's not like and don't send your third fourth advisor happens to be your cousin like go yourself get these people talk to them listen to what they're saying and get them to come but you know another one of my lectures here is part of the problem is and this is a I'll go to the TV their doich it tech in a in Germany is viewed as a science project. But this is a it is actually an art project built by entrepreneurs who are more artists it's not a science project it's not about being like like it's not the same thing is mech molecular biology it's delivering something someone buys. And there the in the world's best people are sitting in one place in a lot of more from this region. But and so that that should be like priority one two three four and like this spending money it's it's a really bad idea because then you get advocacy around the money. Well this isn't working but the person spending it says it's the best in the world. This is very absolute disaster and by the way it's like all these things are going to be much harder even for Palantir if there's no competition like you know people are always like why did this article be get written by you about you it's not true they don't like somebody at our company or whatever that those are problems and we're miserable dealing with them. That's not what we're good at but but I'll tell you another problem if you're in a market where there's no competition the people competing against you make sure they're bad articles about you all the time because they're not going to win on the tech. And Germany German French Swiss listening companies you all know that when you're delivering your best product and no there's no competition suddenly there's 5,000 articles about why it's not the best product or they're bad or they're evil or they're too it's like so it's a problem for us to. Like you know get some competition you know stop talking about these like salacious things that make no sense talk about the product you prefer don't stop writing articles about somebody you hate because they disagree with you politically ask them what is it that you can learn from them. So this is how you build a business you think everyone I talk to a building Palantir I like. I read with politically. I kind of look for people I don't expect I'm going to agree with politically I want to talk to them at least when we're actually talking obviously is an advocate context or maybe we have to advocate but like it's like and by the way it's I don't know what you guys are learning now in school in Germany but you know where I learned this the most besides at home in my somewhat German family. German University if you hand in a paper in German University and you write this article this author is an idiot because of something they said in paragraph 5. Your your professor actually the American version would be I'll give you a B and but in Germany professor won't even talk to you again it's like you're an idiot like you it's like that's what will happen it's like you write a paper that that's that then you'll have no second medium. And why is it that this is lost on the political culture now in both cultures is beyond me. Great. Let me go back to my tablet. I hope I'm not overlooking anyone. Okay let me take one question and go to you sir. There's a question on AI how can we enable AI based predictive policing systems to improve police effectiveness without exacerbating the problem of ethnic or I guess of ethnic or racial profiling. So again I there's the there's there are a lot of these things come down to moral and legal so like legally you know there's a lot of discussions jurisdictions I I kind of personally believe that the more powerful versions of technology should be left to the anti terror context now where I might disagree with people is like they might think this shouldn't be used in the anti terror context. That's a legitimate debate ultimately it's paling to your position that we believe in the sovereign sovereign entity of Western democracies to choose that's a for example I'm there are a lot of AI programs that are being built in America that I support we support we're part of that I think the German government would not support maybe that will change I think that's a legitimate debate then you get to the importation more to Ken's question of like these technologies under what conditions. Kenna and I'll just change us to make it slightly legal a non predicate based search meaning they don't know that you are guilty you may not know your guilty but they get you before your guilty kind of thing. I think we should be very careful about that now there there's also their racial ethical ethical various versions of this are particularly bad but I think that's largely starts with it just being something to be very careful. I think we should be careful about with regard to all human behavior and we in the West have a standard of innocence that means at the very least you have to be engaged in something for us to prevent it so pre preventing things which by the way is technically feasible and you will find non Western countries or if you talk to people they are thinking it's also ethical I tend to think is a mistake and I think that's a very important thing. I'm not in favor of that and then there's the obviously the the way in which it can be used in certain communities which is particularly heinous but it's just I do you think it's a mistake not to recognize this is just a technical it's it's taking something that may be appropriate when it's like in a war zone and bringing it to general societies with equal efficacy. You're you're basically saying that there needs to be no predicate and the predicate is that in the end the deliverables that you reduce crime independent of predicates I think that's a slippery slope and something we should avoid. Okay let's turn to the gentleman yes please correct me please if I miss an assorted you said first that we lack this girls in Germany which I totally agree and this is that okay I didn't say that but yeah but yes yeah. I think you have Germany has the skills but there's a cultural shift there's a difference. Okay and additionally said there are your restrictions that you would like to have so sorry what is the your restriction but you mean it's the conscious rule of Germany and then it should be resettian. No I'm sorry yeah um they say to me on the other hand of course we have not the skills or not the understanding and also they had a good strict clear beforehand so that they can just use it. Then the first question is if we don't have the skills how we should control the implementation of this program and the second question is not to say we are skills and to build it up or we have the skills that you bring in Germany but but a quasi or go in front of a frame that you have to be able to control if we are we are ourselves that we don't understand that they are our programs to set up questions and the second one then in this context we should not even build the skills itself as up to buy from the outside. Okay I just I think there's a misunderstanding in my English on the first one what I'm saying is you do have the skills to control it and I don't mean you they exist in this country there are very Germany has among the best engineers in the world we hire German engineers every day by the way they come to us because they can be partly in a almost German environment but in an American company there are more than enough skills to build companies here and control what's being done with the software. So that part it's it's it's like so there's a building the company and then watching what what is happening and that's the first part of the question. And and then in some ways no I believe that there's a second part of the question which is why is it that certain products have to be bought from us and can't be bought from Germans and that look I wanted to I'm very happy to advise Germany how to change that but right now if you do you do an outstribe and you list 50 characteristics you need for a product you will buy pound here. You may not want to buy pound is like there are certain things that are written in the regulation that we provide no one else provides and that should change but that's going to be a five year process and or four year process it's start now and I'm very in favor of that what what I'm largely critical of is why is it that we hire so many German engineers that are so good there should be more of a startup culture here and there is a startup culture but it is not at the level it should be. Hello. Okay. We have a very cool. Petry microphone coming. Okay. So thank you Alex for the very clear words and I'm running a jet air foundation trying to set up either a DARPA or in Qtell in Europe and I can tell you a request and a question. The request is totally right with the money that is spent but then you probably not you but your colleagues in the Silicon Valley should stop flattering European leaders when they build up these billion dollar funds because why do you think they flatter them but that's the question and smart. We can't tell them to stop being smart it's your problem you need to tell them that we're not that dumb but that's what we're trying to do but you know there's a bit of Stockholm syndrome here is we hate Facebook. But we love to welcome Mark Zuckerberg either at the LZ or the Kansler and I think that needs to this this this cognitive manipulation that we are engaged in the question to you is more on the on the foresight could we see how much authoritarian systems are using technologies for authoritarian. Where would you see the most interesting technology development for what we could call democracy supporting or the more crazy affirming technologies could you give us some sense about where do you think these new companies products should be developing from by the way on the. My personal assessment is the problem in Europe is that the town is so high but the output is not high enough so it's like the talent is still. Among the best in the world and by the way it's like I don't know where you're from but you know we recruit a lot of people from European countries France Germany German speaking world like the French educational system. Produces very very quantitative people the rigor of it's just a very very special culture with very unique attributes that you know are very valuable to us commercially and not just. It's not just that we deliver the products here we're building our largest offices in England in London we have the foundry product I want to get into the details of it commercial details but my humble opinion is the single most successful product in the world now. I'm pure you can see this in the numbers and by a lot built in London used across Europe and industry. So I there's just like it's not the town it's harnessing the talent and again I do think it would be really crucial to harness the town with people who've done this before a lot of them are European they're just not here that something set of meeting with maybe you know well known figures all time you can meet with some people that are one actually culturally want to be here or believe in the culture I include myself. And not because they want to question or they want to say they were they saw leader Hosam and biome it's like something like that. And and then so on the second question I to like raise the standards in AI but my version of it is in the military context of AI simultaneously raise the standards so that there's some transparency. So I think it's a very evaluated evaluatable by third parties but it's still the best AI in the world and that's a very compelling project because in the end the future will be litigated by whoever owns these things and in my view this is where we probably would actually disagree I believe if you want human rights watch to have a huge role in the world it will only work if the West is dominant otherwise it would be completely academic. And if you want people to listen people you know in my view of very naive again most of my friends are progressive I view myself as progressive when maybe a more 70s version of it but people believe America adopted basically an American norms because they're the best norms is what a lot of people believe I believe they did it because they were the best norms that also made people's lives wealthier more ethical and it was the combination that got people to do it. And if Europe and America which have very different ideas on many issues but broadly share certain notions want to have a big influence culturally on the world you have to win this battle then you can adjudicate the and that's an area where you know Europeans could lead Americans can play a role I kind of a more optimistic on that than I was before simply because look at this conference people are like pretty interested all of a sudden in working together. It's amazing how that can change it would I mean you know it's better than me but I only know I'm in these meetings with clients all day but my sense is people are kind of working together and happier to see each other than the past. I'm sure that's true can I ask one last question I mean I guess it's very naive question. When we talk about deficiencies in Europe and potentials as compared to the US in your estimation what is the relative weight in this race that government has versus the private sector I mean in this country needless to explain this to you there's always this sense the government needs to take the initiative the government needs to come up with a plan so that we have a more competitive digital software industry etc. Has Silicon Valley been invented by creative business people or to what extent was that an outflow of government activities like DARPA for example etc. Let me give you an outflow info argument that is more but so it's not silicon there's two phases of Silicon Valley the Silicon Valley we all think about now which in my view has quite obvious problems but Silicon Valley one post war which was crucial in winning World War II but then part of that were German speaking immigrants moving to America and building technologies that were dual use meaning they were using the military first. And then they were used for society Silicon Valley two is we turn your data into product we make all the money and you get to feel bad about not like near cousin anymore and and and and Silicon Valley three I think and where it will be often dual use and so then that brings to Europe like again I think Europe is as enormous benefits and lots of areas I kind of internally view my self as this has been a very important part of my life my family's life other it's but there it's like I could give you a neutral example like people are always talking about reforming Americans institutions and I constantly tell them well stop talking to other Americans go to Germany like it's like it actually works in Germany do allow do allow the hospital just like having like this works Germans have a much higher standard of living in general than America. Americans and like why are we always talking to ourselves about what can work in America why don't you go to a country that works at scale so you can't just go to like stand and have it's too small and bring them over why don't you hire some of them like why are we constantly talking about it's we're clearly not good at this but there is a country that's very good at this and it happens to be a friend and I would just say the same thing it's like okay who knows why we're so good at this in our tiny sliver in America but it's indisputable that we're good at it and instead of again that's where I would say stuff that I you know people in Europe probably was like stop the spending get to the know how it did tech and I'll and we're probably the clock the interesting thing about tech is it's it I mean it's obvious we forget this it's disruptive like our little foundry product in technical financial terms has a is growing at a internal rate of growth in the last couple years at 150% in America commercial and 240% in government which means it's like this thing is just sprouting up everywhere. We started a company with five people and a couple million dollars okay that's how you build tech less money or work you go get the money it's how it's done there's no point having an academic discussion about how to do it just like in America the academic discussions are like should we have vocational education should we as okay get the experts higher you has anyone called you and asked you would you like to be in charge of education Alex thank you very much we've reached our time limit I really want to thank you I think this was at least for me highly informative educational will will I will need to think about some of these aspects a lot more going forward so I think on behalf of the whole group can I just invite you all to thank Alex. Thank you. It makes me feel really good when when when I hear you say that you enjoy and and it gives you something to participate in in our activities in our in our events makes me feel good because I do think that's my final word. I my team and I we we've discovered not this year a few years ago that if we don't include these types of issues tech high tech innovate innovation not only will we lose the connection to to you know to what's happening but we would also lose the ability to be useful to our government's decisions to companies to our clients and sponsors so I'm I just want to conclude by saying that by creating a tech innovation arm within the Munich security conference activities I think this has been one of the most fascinating activities that my team and I have conducted over the last last three years and we will certainly want to continue that it is I think almost as certainly as important in the longer term as our effort to help people understand how important pandemic prevention is international health security or or energy and climate for policy so thank you for making us helping us understand these relationships and do come again we need people with your with your transatlantic expertise at background you understand I think chairman the better than most Germans so thanks a lot thank you I really enjoy
