Good afternoon. So I wanted to start today by challenging all the think about a nagging issue that you have in your business. A real problem that year after year after year shows up on your strategic planning list and initiatives. That's what we did and we did it and we had the same problem for the last decade and I was told that we had it for the last 40 years. We solved it and we solved it by starting with who experiences that issue every day. That's our factories. We make car batteries and our front line the way in which when they go to pick a battery from the shelf and how do they get that on a pallet to get to one of our customers was a problem and they didn't do it efficiently and I would issue guidance to say no I need to prioritize this customer. Well guess what they didn't do it. That wasn't because they weren't trying not to do it. They didn't have the right technology to do it and so we went ahead and partnered with Palantir to solve this and it was really successful because we started at what is the issue that we were trying to solve and we're just getting started so I would please visit table five, Lisa Wenders, I'm a team we'll be going through and showing you all kinds of great inventory work and what I spend my time thinking about is we get into the next fiscal year and planning and other activities is what should we do next right because we've all built ontologies now and it's pretty amazing right and where can you go and what use case can you do and then I stop and I say what why am I doing all this is for the customer make no mistake everyone in this room every one of our customers has a choice I think I'm gonna go with you or they can go with somebody else so what I'm thinking about and what we're investing in is where do we have different making sure that that choice is always clear else and how do we do that better every single day by providing them more optionality and faster lead times and better delivery there's over 300 million automotive batteries out there in the US market and every day we need to make sure that our customers have the right battery in the right place so they can service their customers and that's what we do day in and day out so look I you know yes it's time to celebrate and it's the holiday season that's great but some every one of us in this room somebody is trying to take what we have and I'd ask you to think about it you continue to build out your ontology how is that customer in mind how are potentially your factories or other people that you have to make that more efficient in mind that's what this allows you to do and the and the use cases are endless what I struggle with is how do you prioritize them all right you can go out there and be like well that sounds fun does that help my customer does that help me be more efficient ultimately does that maintain my market share position so it's a great year happy to be here and please visit station five thank you
