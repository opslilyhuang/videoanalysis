TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The pandemic has led to the lack of information through the safety of the six safe-reliability regions, together with volunteer technologies, to technical tools, where the safety regions are the version of information that is understood by the members of the measures in a large crisis such as COVID-19. Through integrating public-to-bank data from a scale of information, such as demographic and economic information, we have given it to tourism and market and COVID-19 data from the RIVM, we have built a broad image of the safety region. This image gives an overview of the crisis situation, in this case the pandemic. Every authorized team like the safety region director and information managers can take the COVID-19 measures and a geografic distribution, which will soon be very soon monitored. Let's say that I have been working on information management for Zuit Limburg, with the strong identifying of the communities we can possibly be able to do our job in the coming weeks. The warning to the right side is to learn new languages so that the affected communities can quickly and efficiently look after the measures. Let's look at the measures. We see that these measures have a higher than average risk population, and that they are less positive tested people than the national measures are more visible at home and overlaid people. After the COVID-19-specific information, I can diversify in other information about the measures, such as demographic, socio-economic and mobility data. The integrated public mobility data of Google lets us see how the mobility of the residents reacts to the measures of the pandemic. Now I'm looking for my own radar state, which I want to look for in the area, which have been in the coming two weeks. Here I see the information for Limburg Zuit in the coming two weeks. Before I start the analysis, I would like to introduce the latest policy measures, to prepare the collective data. My colleague and I can now continue to talk about future analyses. Let's now look at the situation in the region. The weather conditions let me know where extra attention is. These weather conditions combine data about regional events, with the world's expectation of the economy, information about the weather conditions and data about COVID-19. The triggers for these weather conditions are the team's own dynamics. There is a football match between Zoroah and YC in the coming months of December 14th. I can look at the context of the event, as the current situation of the weather conditions and the weather conditions of the weather conditions. Also, as well as supporters in the stadium that have stood up, they are still in the middle of the building, where the pressure and risk can be formed to the extent of the other half-meter distance. To set up a colleague of this area on the high ground, I can now take this part, so that they can receive a mail-in. When the last step is completed, I can combine these conditions in a report to see the ROT or RBT over the summer. Or to share with a colleague. This report is live and is always the most updated image of the situation. Thanks to the most significant data phenomena, this report can be parameterised, so that we can share the between the regions and the cooperation possible. The southern six regions in the field lab have used these tools to support the pandemic. Together we will continue to work on this and evaluate our safety and crisis tools for the safety regions.
