But I really make you feel like the 97 Chicago Bulls here don't take. When I entered the room this morning I thought wait a minute it's only been six months since I was in the audience. This is a moment that Palantir predicted the only rule we care about in our products and working with you is your company becomes more valuable. Zero chance for error when you're thinking about national security needs, space-based operations, hypersonic vehicles that have temperatures inside of them at five to six thousand degrees. America is absolutely unique country in the history of humanity. The way we fight is different than how other people fight. This is fundamentally about American competitiveness. If we were to rely on humans solely to accept or reject these suggestions every 15 minutes across 4,000 stores that are already rolled out that would amount to about 384 billion decisions every day. I think about it in terms of agents being part of our workforce. AT&T has been working with Palantir for well over five years with over 39,000 people at AT&T having touched Foundry with 8,500 active users every month and over 600 different use cases. It could happen to you as well because penalty is about speed. That took me five minutes. A year ago that would have taken us 15 people all day calling distribution centers, manufacturing points, checking with individual restaurants and then the beauty of it is we would have come in the next day and done the exact same time. It really enables our medical coders to work at an unprecedented scale and speed on behalf of providers and physicians. Gone from 20 million tickets a day that we have to look through in seven different circuit sources, let alone all the other inventory systems everything we have to bring together. That was a revolutionary moment. To that point everyone told us all of the reasons we couldn't do what we wanted to do. The moment that Palantir said yes it was one of those times we're like wait a minute we're not crazy we can actually do this. No one wants to hear oh we didn't get you something because of our MRP system was down or wrong. I told them what I didn't want. I did not want a dashboard to tell me I was in trouble. I didn't need an ERP MRP system not that those are bad but those are five years of instant mutations just to find out you did it wrong. Foundry is founded or executives in a way that Linar has never seen before. We've organized our entire team around this. For the first time the technology or the college like the IT organization Amacia Yo we are at the front-end center of taking the company to a very different time.
