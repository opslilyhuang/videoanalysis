All right. Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Last talk of the session, then we get to go watch one more keynote and then hang out. So I'm going to talk to you all this afternoon about the role of early detection and wastewater surveillance and driving health outcomes. My name is Nusha Galey and I am president and co-founder of Biobot Analytics. All right. So many of you are probably familiar with wastewater surveillance through the work that's been done during the COVID-19 pandemic. It gained a lot of popularity this approach over the last few years. And it's really based on a very simple idea. If you don't know much about it, water epidemiology, as many call it wastewater monitoring, wastewater surveillance, is based on the idea that there's a ton of information on our health and our urine and stool. We're excreting that every single day where it's passively collecting in our city sewers and presents this tremendous opportunity for us to understand very rapidly in a very cost effective way, relatively cost effective way, understand the health of entire communities, very large population sets. At Biobot, we are experts. We are experts at collecting and analyzing information on infectious disease pathogens that we're excreting information on chemical biomarkers, of things that we're consuming and excreting to understand and really create this additional tool in our toolkit about community health and population health. So we are turning our sewers into data observatories. All right. And so we at Biobot think about this opportunity as wastewater intelligence to save lives. Our vision is very expansive. So yes, it is about preventing the next pandemic before it happens, but it's also about detecting waves and illicit drug use and manufacturing. It's about improving national security through the identification of man-made threats in our communities. It's about identifying asymptomatic and invisible patient populations to bring services to them. And it's about ensuring food security and the stability of our food supply chain. Think about monitoring livestock health, for example. So today I'm going to give you a little bit of background on Biobot as a company. Talk about how we very rapidly scaled up to meet the demands of COVID-19 and then share some few use cases with you. So before I dive in, Biobot was founded in 2017 by myself and my co-founder, Dr. Mariana Matus. We met at MIT back in 2014, so almost 10 years ago now. And Mariana was completing a PhD in computational biology. She went on to actually write her PhD dissertation on wastewater epidemiology. So at the time, she was one of very few technical experts in this space and experts in this space. I myself came into this world with a background in architecture and engineering. And for all the data folks out there when I say architecture, I mean architecture like buildings, not data. And so I had started a research fellowship looking at smart cities and the opportunities presented to us in thinking about how we can improve our cities and communities based on just the proliferation of data, geo-located data in our communities. And so Mariana and I brought our very different backgrounds together in order to basically think about our sewer systems as our collective microbiome or our urban gut. We were very fortunate in receiving quite a generous amount of academic grant funding that sponsored our work for about three years and in 2017 Biobot was born. So when we first started Biobot, we focused on what was the biggest public health crisis at that time, the opioid epidemic. Around the same time that we were getting the company off the ground, we came across a study published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health where they observed they estimated that our overdose data represents overdose death data, represents less than 1% of people that are suffering from substance use disorder. Yet we know that this data is driving billions of dollars of aid and resources at the federal, state, and local level. So basically we're flying blind a little bit. The more and more we learned about this, the more we knew that communities, jurisdictions just needed better data, better complimentary data to help them understand the size of the population at risk for opioid-related harms in order to allocate resources, appropriately plan, and implement prevention treatment and recovery services. So this was really the problem we set out to tackle at the onset. So in 2018, we launched our first product that was analyzing over a dozen prescription opioids, differentiating actually between the different types of prescription opioids, illicit opioids like heroin and fentanyl and substitution therapies like methadone, buprenorphine, and the overdose reversal drug, Narcan. Our first customer was the town of Kerry in North Carolina, and the mayor's office came to us because they were seeing an increase in overdose deaths year over year, and they didn't know what to do about that. They weren't doing as badly as others in their county or others in the state, so weren't getting a ton of support from local public health departments, but the mayor's office still wanted to do something. So together we worked with them to start collecting data from several communities throughout the city, and actually what we saw was that the data was consistently showing that the most commonly consumed drugs were prescription opioids actually, and not in the downtown core where they expected a lot of the drug activity was happening, but rather in the outskirts of the city that had very different demographics than the downtown core. We didn't see a lot of heroin, we didn't see a lot of fentanyl, we actually saw no medication-assisted treatments, and so what the city did was divert quite a bit of the funding that they were putting into needle exchange units in the downtown area, and set up and advertised medication take-back programs all across the city. They held some like 50-some odd town hall-style meetings in public schools, and for the first time we're able to actually engage the community in a dialogue, not about this scary overdose epidemic or heroin problem, but rather about the adverse effects of medication painkillers, so change their language, and they actually collected three times as many prescription opioids in weight that year than any prior year, and reduced overdoses ultimately by 40%, they saw reduction in overdoses by 40% moving into the subsequent year, and they credit that to just knowing what to do, basically they were able to implement the right solutions that were uniquely tailored for their community and the problems that they were seeing. So then COVID hit, so we deployed and carried in 2018, an early-stage young startup just getting things off the ground, working in public health, and COVID hit, and at the time we were only five employees and had our opioid product deployed in eight cities. Very exciting for us. So being a venture-backed company, we were having a hard time convincing investors to invest in a company focused on public health, selling to government, but we had succeeded at the beginning of 2020 and enclosing a small seed round. So that despite the challenges we were facing to scale, we were well funded at the beginning of 2020 for being five employees. And COVID hit, and in February, I remember someone on our team came across a study that showed that a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was actually excreting the virus in their stool. And so that's when we knew that, okay, we should be able to find this virus in sewage. So we spent a couple weeks calling up all the state and federal government officials that we had met over the three prior years of having started the company, asking for some funding to fund R&D to develop the assay to test for SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, and we're largely unsuccessful. But we decided, we're going to tap into our expensive venture dollars and do this anyways because we need to respond as a public health company. So by mid-March 2020, we successfully developed the assay, and by the end of March, our five percent, well, we were six people at this point, our six-person company had scaled to deploy our SARS-CoV-2 assay in over 100 cities across the company by the end of March. We were fully funding this work, by the way, ourselves. We hadn't succeeded in getting much, much commercial support from cities. We would go on to fund this pro bono COVID-19 campaign through June of 2020 and expand to almost 400 sites across the country. Things look very different today, so to date, our database represents over 1,000 sampling locations across the US and Canada. We operate in all 50 states, including territories like Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, and Guam. Our data represents, yeah, over 40% of the US population and our labs and data pipelines have now processed over 100,000 samples. And we are about over 100 employees. And we, oh, if we can go back one slide, please, sorry. And we no longer need to do this work pro bono. So we have been awarded contracts from agencies across all levels of government. I think most notably to the folks in this room, you're probably aware of our work with the CDC News team. We've been working with them and HHS since middle of 2021. And it's through that work that we've been working very closely with Herschen, the team at Palantir. But we also do a tremendous amount of work with state and local governments. And actually, today, we just announced a few hours ago on national opioid awareness day that we actually just secured another federal contract that was awarded by NIDA to actually scale our substance use monitoring across the country. So that was just announced today and kicked off, actually about a week ago or so. So very excited about that. And what all of these folks see is really the value in wastewater data as a predictive, inclusive, and versatile source data source on human health and human well-being. All right. So let's dive into the data itself. So first, as I said, wastewater data has been shown to be predictive. It's been shown to be a leading indicator of clinical cases. So this was made particularly clear earlier in the pandemic when clinical data was very robust. And so here we're looking at the Omicron wave of early 2022. The dates are quite small on the plot, but the first date is January, February through March. The plot starts somewhere in December, 2021. And what you can see with the dark blue line is the wastewater data. So the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage. So we measure it by RNA copies per liter. And this is data from the state of Massachusetts. And the bars in behind is actually the CDC clinically reported data of case counts per day. So at the time, we were very robustly reporting clinical cases every single day. And what you can see is that the peak where that wastewater data peaked is very different from where the clinical data peaked. And what we actually see there is a two-week leading indicator, a two-week time. And the reason for this is because, you know, by the time people develop symptoms and then make the decision to go get tested and then get those test results back and those test results get reported, that's what introduces this time lag. Whereas by that point, they've already been excreting the virus for days in their stool. So from 2020 to 2022, we've observed anywhere from a five to 15-day leading indicator in wastewater as compared to clinical data. We also see this trend when we look at sewage sequencing data. So here we're looking at data from Massachusetts statewide data, variant data, that shows the takeover of the XBB variant and sublinearges this past winter. So in hot pink, we start to see that hot pink bar start around December 2022 through June this, sorry, December 2022. Through June of 2023 and we see how rapidly XBB just took over in the samples that we were analyzing. So second, wastewater data is inclusive. So as clinical data has become less readily available throughout the pandemic, wastewater has become this more reliable source of disease prevalence. So you can see here very early in the pandemic, so this plot is starting actually in 2020. So you can see very early in the pandemic that the wastewater data in the sick or blue line tracks very well with the clinical data in behind. But as we get now past January 2022, past that Omicron surge, we see this huge divergence in data. And a lot of the local communities in particular that we work with tell us that they really rely on this information because it's the only information that gives them a little bit of a pulse check on what is going on in their communities. One thing we like to say at Biobot is that everybody has a voice in our sewer systems. So we don't rely on people accessing the healthcare system in order to be counted and represent it in the information. As long as people are peeing and pooping, you know, we have a pulse on what they're doing. Waste water data is also being collected at different site types beyond just the city or wastewater treatment plant level. So this is a plot from some of the work that we're doing, that we are doing with a major international airport here in the United States. Where you can see that the airport wastewater data is a leading indicator on the already leading indicator of community level wastewater data. So in blue is the airport data where we're looking at the EG5 variant. And we can see that EG5 variant is present in the airport data earlier and in higher concentrations than it starts to be represented in that regional data, which is the entire sort of like region that our EP team has outlined as kind of being the tributary of that airport. So this is incredibly important. You know, because as we know biology knows no borders, infectious disease pathogens that originate outside the US will come through our airports. And so this goes beyond public health and international security, our ability to be able to actually keep a pulse on on what is coming into our airports. So one concrete example I like to use to just really drive home what communities can do with this information is talked about in this New York Times article that was published in January of 2022 during the Omicron surge where the journalist is interviewing Boston Children's Hospital's chief medical officer, where he's quoted saying that actually based on the observed surge in wastewater data, they canceled or postponed rather all non-emergency medical procedure at procedures at the hospital. They had seen time and time again through the pandemic up until that point, clinical cases follow wastewater, hospitalizations follow clinical cases. And so they postponed non-emergency procedures in order to free up capacity for a potential surge in hospitalizations. And then he goes on to say that if the wastewater data looks encouraging, the hospital may begin scheduling more elective procedures for the second half of February. So here is a very concrete example of just very real time operational decisions that the healthcare community can start to make using wastewater data. And then going back to my list, so wastewater data is predictive, it's inclusive, finally it is versatile. So we are using wastewater intelligence to track beyond COVID-19 within that infectious disease world. Last summer we very rapidly expanded M-Pox monitoring across the U.S. through our engagement with the news team through our work already with the CDC. We have since this year launched capabilities to monitor for Naurovirus, as well as we are about to launch a more comprehensive respiratory illness panel that is not just looking at COVID-19 and COVID-19 variants, but also influenza A and B as well as RSV, particularly important heading into this year's flu season. And that's just the beginning. Looking at metagenomics data from sewage around the world, that's what we're looking at here. What we can see is there is a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens that are detected in sewage. The axis is a little too small to read, so these include hepatitis C, HEPI, HIV, various Pox viruses, STI, CDIF. So this is what we're building towards, right? Being able to look at all sorts of different pathogens. And we roll all of this information into a single data platform where our partners can view and access data across sites and across pathogens. So what we do is we use this data, we add to it as referencing the keynote, one of the keynotes this morning, we're adding to this raw data, and then we're adding to it and adding to it, and we're building data products. And that's what our customers are using. And they're left with tremendous potential to be able to address this list of things. So wastewater intelligence to save lives. I've talked about how we can use this information to prevent the next pandemic and detect illicit consumption monitoring. But really, you know, where we're moving to now is leveraging this information to improve national security, identify invisible patient populations and ensure food security. So if there's one thought that I can leave you with today, it's that wastewater intelligence needs to be core to our global bio security strategy. We need a global platform of Sentinel wastewater sites around the world that is our vision at Biobot is a world that has this. And now is the time to scale. Our mission is to build this and our vision is to see this happen. Now is the time to scale because monumental societal shifts, like climate change, like urbanization and overpopulation, and increasingly connected and globalized world are just increasing the potential of outbreaks with with pandemic potential. And as Senator Hickenlooper said this morning, this might feel a little woe, but I hope I shared the giddy up that that we have an opportunity here. And so with that, thank you. And if there's any questions, I can take them. I'm an epidemiologist. You shared a lot of advantages to wastewater. I want to hear from you the limitations of wastewater and how you're kind of thinking about those and how we communicate those during response. Yeah, so I think one of the key kind of like challenges that we had at the beginning of the of the pandemic when working with local public health departments was also talking, we're working with a community and groups of people who are used to using very precise accurate data. And with wastewater data, it's an approximation, right? It is, we're looking at averages of what we might find in our community. We don't know if data represents a single supersheter, for example, or multiple, you know, folks who are shedding just a little bit of the virus. There's all these caveats in the data. So at the beginning of the pandemic, we were really pushed by a lot of local public health folks that we worked with to try and give case estimates, for example, how can this data tell us exactly or even within an order of magnitude how many people are infected. And there was a lot of thought that went into, can we answer this question? And I think where we landed was this and for and I loved the analogy that Dylan shared about the weather map, like this information should be used a little bit like a weather forecast, right? It's not precise in that way. The advantage there is that it's preserving anonymity, it's a data source that is inherently aggregated and anonymized at that population level or the level that you're testing for and that makes it really powerful then and easy to share. I would say another limitation right now, just very technically speaking, is that we can only detect things and look for things that we know to look, that we are looking for, right? And so one of the things on our road map and that we're working towards, because we see tremendous potential there is pathogen agnostic testing. And we're doing research around, you know, technology, just R&D and technologies like Madaginomics and really excited that, you know, we have, there is a line of sight to getting there but the technology is just not there right now. All right, thank you.
