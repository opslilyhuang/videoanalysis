TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Many workflows depend on harnessing large-scale sensor data to track transient events and thrive in the new normal of shorter cycles of command-evolatility. Streaming and processing thousands of data points isn't enough. The Foundryontology brings together streaming data, analytics, and real-world action, allowing you to simulate the future and take proactive steps to achieve a valuable outcome, from preventing failures and disruption to decreasing emissions, to increasing production. The Foundryontology is a base plate built on top of your existing software investments. Data engineers are able to model the world into intuitive objects, like a well. They can bind streaming data to the well object, and bring together related events data, with tabular and unstructured data using a point-and-click interface. Data scientists are able to add models, providing a real-time state for every asset, while engineers define the relationships between objects, and subject matter experts compose logic on top, to monitor these assets and set up alerts when things change unexpectedly. With the data in the ontology, intelligent operations are unlocked. We start with a pump, in this case ESP. An engineer has alerted that the motor temperature has increased on an ESP, that corresponds with an increasing GR. She alerts the operator who shuts down the pump. The engineer can then review the pump design and evaluate an operational change to prevent future shutdowns and potentially costly damage. The pump in question is written back to the list of well objects in the ontology, for potential intervention. This means that the context from this particular incident is applied to inform future completion designs, as well as preventative shutdowns. The original alert is updated based on this event, so that the next time this happens, operators are able to evaluate and learn, getting smarter over time.
