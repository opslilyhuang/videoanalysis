TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Welcome back to Squack Box this morning. Our next guest is soundly alarm that Silicon Valley and the West have lost their way. Joining us right now is Alex Carp Palantir, CEO and co-founder. His first book is out this morning the technological, republic hard power, soft belief and the future of the West. We want to thank you for joining us. It's kind of risque. It's a little risque. It's a little risque. The title, it's like it's hard to know if it's like an off-color movie hard power soft. But oh, he goes there early. It's hard to know. It's hard to know. I have a lot of many questions about the book but before we get there I just want to ask you a couple things about the news because interestingly I would say the book which you wrote a year ago in a way you were predicting where we were today in terms of some of the big issues. You know the interesting thing basically where people say it's not actually a standard book is comes in two forms either promote yourself it should be Carp AI, Carp AI or it's somebody running for president I'm doing neither. And so the book really is an attempt to say look everything you learned at your school in college about how the world works is intellectually and correct. And here is a way of seeing the world that may not be right but it's not wrong. And so trying to be right is very hard but you can definitely know what's wrong. And what what you've been taught in college that you basically should have no beliefs that the West isn't fearier that the intellectual tradition of the West it leads to self-flagulation and losing on the battlefield losing intellectually losing your party losing your country losing your border that your institutions can't work because we're so good it's actually wrong. And the West was actually never about that and you can be good decent and win and be intellectually correct and what was absolutely spot on about what's in the book is we have this technological revolution it's no longer fake. Two four three four years ago institutions basically thought I'd rather have a good steak dinner and a bad product and at least I get the steak dinner because the software product doesn't work. Now we are in a software defined world and the nation that leads software is the USA and then so what does that mean for all institutions? What it means as institutions have to actually live up to their core their core mandate so a country has to have a border the educational institutions have to work the military actually has to be scary you actually can have things function in a way where the outputs are much greater than the inputs and and people who ignore this are going to be washed away. Why'd you write this? Is it were you mad at the educational system? Did you think that they were teaching the wrong things? I think I think the West as a notion and as a principle upon which it is actually again is obviously superior and not acknowledging that because by not acknowledging it or denying it you could pretend you were smarter or better than you were has led to enormous problems in our society and also for the sake of humanity we have been blessed with a resource called talent and talent management and software production that no other country has. So what does that mean for us? What does it mean for the world? How do you manage that ethically? How do you and how do you prevent what we had essentially? We had a pagan religion that is infiltrated our universities and that pagan religion basically says everything that's good about America everything that actually works is Ipsophacto bad and and by the way you can't talk about it not working because it's a religion so what it's not even it's a it's a new religion it's not an old great religion Judaism Christianity Islam it's it's a new religion and the tenants are West is bad nothing can work if it works it's bad and the West is and and and that way of thinking has corroded every aspect of a site last not least it leads to a situation where you get a complete corrosion of all institutions and and to a legitimacy crisis so no one actually believes anyone's an expert I'll just make this last point in the fifties if there was this famous professor Ken Arrow and if Ken Arrow said you were smart you got tenure and why did that happen is because people knew Ken Arrow is smart the institution he represents is the best in the world there is no one like Ashley the only thing like that currently in tech as a pound here to agree if you work for pound chair everyone knows you're good and that's basically none of these like when we went to school the schools actually had credibility the people the science was actually science you could let me just ask and then I want to actually get into some of the news but what would you do to bring it back and and you think we're on that path now well I think actually so one of the things that's not in the book I think if you would read the book it reads like it was written today but so I'll just one of the things I that that I would if I were writing the book today there's a sense that people have that there's a pendulum swing so if you like like if you look at institutions that are failing and you talk to the smart people there universities new and democratic party they'll tell you there's going to be a pendulum swing back but AI is actually breaking the pendulum spring so what what Europe thinks you feel like I spent half my life in Germany you talk to smart Germans like okay we're having a bad time we're gonna have a good time we did this under shooter it'll come back we don't actually agree with all the stuff that people say we can't say it publicly that's what they say okay but what they're not understanding is the technical revolution now is so great you got to get on the train because that train is leaving and it will there is not going to be a swingback so what I'm trying to say to people who are on the pendulum people who are builders is like we have a responsibility we have to be dedicated to our nation what I'm saying to people who may have think they can get off the train university intellectuals united nations dedicated to undermining America and anyone who's due or something you're being left behind and by the way I'm happy you're being left behind but just know if you get left behind do not cry that you're not part of the dialogue right and that's actually what's happening they're like crying cry like all these people are becoming protest parties it's like I grew up protesting in DC with my parents and no one listened if you want to go back to that just do not read the book pretend this isn't happening Alex how did so many whoever's hiring a college is how did it was just sort of a massive stereotype all be on the same page for who gets tenure and in what dogma and orthodoxy makes you attractive the car because it's everywhere I don't understand how it happened I don't I don't think we ever get it back well I understand how it happens it's like the basic this country is fundamentally Calvinist so that when that's one of the great strengths of this country what Calvinism basically says as opposed to like Lutheranism and other is if you've done something being and important you've probably a good person and well you had a university's was an inversion and rejection of that and so all the intellectual movements are downstream from that and so the the and that inversion is very very charismatic if you want to assume that you are right because you're you're wrong basically and it's a very very charismatic movement but I think the area where we bear responsibility who disagree with it is we have to stand up and say but this doesn't work we have to we have to you know one of the things in the book that's unusual as I'm quoting like judge them by the fruits they bear like we have okay you're in favor of this world order what have you built that works what just like show me any institution that you've created any institution and and I want to see that institution where the inputs are less than the outputs which okay and I don't care what it is it can be an intellectual project it can be a road it can be a size skyscraper it can be a weapon system and what what you will find is they will they'll they'll literally say I reject that frame and that's okay but it's our responsibility to hold them to account you rejected the frame of something that could work I'm not saying that everything I'm saying is right I don't know that but I am sure it's certain that what you're saying does not work and you will be left behind in history Alex let me ask you a couple of things that are in the news and I just want to actually relate one of them to something you to say you lived in Germany for half your life yeah and there is a big debate going on about the politics in Germany right now you're also Jewish and there is support and you've been seen it over the weekend Marco Rubio and Elon Musk and others have been very supportive of the alt-right movement in Germany while there've been questions about their association with some supporting Nazis and other things I'm curious where you land on that so like I'm sympathetic with non-discrimination I don't believe in discrimination across any variable but you're being turned into a product by a certain small sector of the left because you're not allowed to talk about facts like in the last couple weeks every week there's a you know what happens in Germany is there's a tear attack in the morning and the greens in the left protest the far right in the afternoon this literally what's happening and the average German I know so many Germans who would never even use the term alternative for Deutsche Land four weeks ago they're telling me like yeah screw it I'm gonna vote for them and the reason why is it's our responsibility and you see this by the way why is the Democratic Party committing suicide it's because it was in the US you're talking in the US it's the same thing it's like we're not allowed to admit we're not allowed to true false like okay I agree with this person I don't agree with this we literally have to say anything that's ever been uttered from this person and their toll timeline has to be wrong including border defense and and this is this is happening in every Western country and again it's a very similar to the question you asked okay we know why they do it the greens and others are really smart to do this because then in the end they define how the societies run but none of us want that society and it's not bigoted to say wait a minute this is not working and then you have fallen on issues it's like then by the way then on the outside would I tell my German friends and pop and private is okay you don't like what people are saying but if you're not taking your immigration policy seriously you have no texting the Germany had the most important texting in the world pre-war bar none like in America it has de facto almost no texting it's nascent no one believes in it no one's investing in the energy policies make no sense and then you wonder why people don't take you seriously you got to fit in in this book it's basically like fix your thing at home or no one's taking you seriously and then when people don't take you seriously you get mad honestly though I'll tell you what I shouldn't even say this but what I tell Europeans and private is you know how when you get to the inner city in America and the the mayor's talking about safety and you're like get me out of this country I tell them this in German that's what we're thinking about your texting no one's to anyone seriously is telling you this is a joke let me ask you one question and by the way like yeah I want to ask you a Ukraine but I'm just as you one German question which is but how do you feel about some of the folks that are part of that far right party and how do you have to deal with it again let me just tell you let me take a trick from the old thing let's if you focus on all some of those people I obviously don't like and probably don't like me and there is there any semitism on the right yes but the structural issue in Germany is actually any semitism in an immigrant population that is like like that is the biggest issue in Europe but by the way the point I'm trying to teach people is focus on what you believe I don't really want to talk like yes there are people who will vote for me I don't like and they don't like me it's like in every issue like there are people who agree with me on Israel and don't I don't agree with on first and second amendment there it's like you you have to focus on what do I believe and you know what they're gonna be people some people come with me I don't like and don't like me that's okay speak to this because we've been talking about Ukraine all morning and you've been very involved in that in that battle I want to show you this real quick if I could I don't know if we even have time Secretary of State Marco Rubio was just speaking literally moments ago and after a four and a half hour meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia to reset relations with Moscow and I would get to your thoughts on it if we could the goal of today's meeting was to follow up on the phone call the president how to week ago and begin to establish those lines of communication the work remains today is the first step of a long and difficult journey but an important one and president Trump is committed to bringing an end to this conflict we're trying to bring an end to the conflict apparently we're also asking for something on the order of 500 was it 500 billion dollars in terms of access to minerals and other things from Ukraine is that a fair deal look yeah I don't know anything about the deal or in the intricacies of it what I would say is first of all you put up people on the screen who are very talented so I if I look at this from an entrepreneurial perspective the first thing I'm looking at is okay those three people are very talented the second thing I think I'll tell you something I think Trump does very very well he says I'm not going to accept a paradigm that essentially leads to a stupid conclusion when he's like okay great I'm gonna give you a new paradigm you don't like that my paradigm give me another one and I think he's I don't say I think he's quite brilliant at this so what I see is he's like I'm not accepting a paradigm where America just keeps financing thing there's no real discussion I'm sending three of the most talented people there let's figure it out and but and again what I would say to people who are trying to figure out how to make themselves how to be builders is do not accept a paradigm that is stupid no matter who tells you that you should have it okay let me ask a different question about paradigm shifting so one of the things that's going on right now Elon Musk working with the Doge team in Washington to try to get at some of the misspending that's been going on over the years I think there's a lot of people who are super supportive of that at the same time you're hearing about resignations and all sorts of other things of folks who are questioning the access that they're getting to data you are somebody who lives within data you care about safety and security of data do you think we should have those concerns and is there a way to do whatever's being done right now so that you can take the country and those who are questioning all this with you well I you know look I would I don't like about what's going on is I just view this as what let's watch the Democratic Party commit suicide and like I've been a Democrat most of my life I would still I kind of view myself as outside it but I don't like watching the Democrats just commit suicide and what I see is most of the country doesn't really at this point given the fraud waste and abuse we know is there 90% of the countries like get right at the front-wasting abuse and I I just view this as yet another example of the progressive left boxing themselves in into a suicide dance now if you what what the progressive left should be doing is saying okay you want you're clearly the most qualified person in the world to do something like this we want to dialogue with you about how you're doing what are you doing I don't believe that's actually what happened and again I probably I liking on and I I think he's the he's obviously the most important builder in the world and I I just think if you want to say my former side I don't believe that they're actually engaging I think is it's like another dance where I'm supposed to say of course like whatever it's like there's this one issue where I might and then you get boxed in to you cannot solve the problem and then I would say what is the biggest problem in this society biggest problem this society from my perspective is legitimacy of our institutions why aren't they legitimate they're not legitimate because okay does it do any of you really believe that 99% of your taxpayer dollars are being spent but last and not least and probably arguably most importantly there's two revolutions happening one is transparency and one is AI okay so why is it that we do not know where every penny of our money goes like how do you explain that to people and got and by the way slightly more technically what large language models do is they mean you can go into the contracts and see exactly what happened so in the past we couldn't do this now we can the right responses we want this to happen we want to happen we want to be involved in the dialogue the real responses it feels like the people criticizing Elon don't want it to happen and this is going to destroy those people Alex Carp the book is called the technological republic thank you for being back to you come back tomorrow you can come back tomorrow can you come back tomorrow we're gonna do this we're gonna I like you know I was I thought that this is a joke because I'm not used to being re-invited no we're starting at six we'll see it's time to six we got three hours we're not off we're not off we got 15 seconds before we can tell it I just told everybody I want you back okay well I I'm not used to like you know the Groucho Marx thing I wouldn't have they would have me as a man but I'm not used to being re-invited and see it tomorrow morning take care make sure you find a squawk on the tree this next
