TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I'm back. It's my privilege to resume tonight's program as you all enjoy your dessert if you haven't found your way to it already. As we heard earlier from Secretary Romando, there are many reasons to feel optimistic about America's ability to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities ahead. And yet we know much work remains if we're to achieve our goals in this area to defend a free and prosperous world as essential we commit ourselves to this work here and now. And what many scholars have grown to describe as the decisive decade. Indeed, and the strategic competition to shape the future of the international order, we face rivals on every front, militarily, technologically, cyberspace to intellectual property diplomacy to trade. In such an environment, it may be tempting to try to divide our priorities into separate realms, a security issue or an economic issue, a problem that is the government's responsibility to solve or something only the private sector can address. But this either or mentality isn't how Ben sees the world, not at all. It isn't how we operate. To us, the blueprint for winning in this competitive landscape and sustaining our influence on the world states comes down to a single, powerful idea, an idea that has distinguished American leadership in times of war and at times of peace and prosperity. And the idea is this, safeguarding our nation is a shared responsibility, one in which we all have a valuable role to play as business executives, as public servants and as citizens. And tonight I have the unique opportunity to add a category even as students. It's fitting that with us tonight at the Eisenhower Awards event, our students who will graduate tomorrow from the Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy at National Defense University. These bright minds demonstrate... These bright minds demonstrate how the next generation of American leaders is answering President Eisenhower's call to preserve our security liberty and the degrees they will receive are powerful illustration of how our national security curriculum in the military is evolving to confront this new era of great power competition. To the representatives with us tonight and they should be in uniform, please stand so we can recognize you all. Come on. Thank you. These students have spent the past year closely studying fields like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, semiconductors, and strategic materials, fields that as Secretary of Monto made clear earlier in this evening are essential to maintaining our competitive edge. To earn their master's degree in national security studies, they were required to meet not just with government leaders or military officials, but also with corporate executives, labor leaders. Indeed, true to President Eisenhower's belief that our security and prosperity are two sides of the same coin, their education is a reflection of the fact that the only way to work ahead is to work together across the sectors and industries. As a result of their efforts, our nation will be far more prepared to pounce on any opportunity and to defeat any adversary that may come our way. So we just want to say thank you for serving our country. Thank you for staying on the gap. And if you really knew the score, the world that they join the military in is a very different world than they're in today. So their entire scope of what they do in the military has absolutely changed. So thanks for for dealing with the change. These soon to be graduates like our honorees tonight understand that the battlefields of our future span, not just war zones, but labs, factories, data centers, emerging victorious and each of these domains will require all of us to do our part. President Eisenhower called for this whole of nation approach to our security and during his farewell address, he said, and I quote, only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that the security and liberty may prosper together. President Eisenhower believed that this was the timeless source of American strength, but fundamentally distinguished us from our adversaries abroad. While tyrants invading a Moscow employee force and exploitation to manipulate the markets, bolster their militaries and undermine the international order, the United States is a nation that draws on creativity from our diversity, strength from our freedom and unity from our shared values. And to anyone who made doubt the fact, I say look around you tonight, look at this incredible room, this incredible gathering, the mission, think of the mission that brings us together in this room tonight. We've gathered a tremendous crowd from diverse industries, generations and backgrounds. Secretary Romando embodies this idea at the high level of government of government and our next honoree brings that idea of the high level in the business sector. Dr. Carp is the 21st century version of a Renaissance man, a multilingual philosopher with a PhD in social theory and a law degree from Stanford, across country skier who also swims and practices chigong meditation every day. And an entrepreneur has spent the last 20 years developing cutting edge analytical technology to solve society's toughest problems. But most importantly tonight with us here, he is a patriot. Two decades ago when Dr. Carp was approached by a former law school classmate to co-found and lead Palantir, the idea of using code to counter terrorism was unheard of to some even laughable. In the company's earliest days, Palantir's funding pitches were rejected left and right. Emails went unanswered. Phone calls were unreturned. This burgeoning data centric defense technical industry as we know it today didn't exist back then. But Dr. Carp is anyone who's worked with him will tell you he's never been won the back down. He didn't buckle under the pressure of investors or let his convictions waver. Instead he just worked harder. And thank God he did because he's made the world a far better place. Today Palantir is a $50 billion publicly traded company. And under his leadership Palantir has written the algorithms that help us do several things. In our allies of course, the work tourists plots shut down human trafficking rings and detect financial crimes. They're in the height of COVID, the COVID-19 pandemic Palantir pivoted to support the public health officials empowering leaders with the tools and the data sets to distribute the lifesaving PPE and vaccines to tens of millions of people, not just in America but across the world. And what sets Dr. Carp's leadership apart goes beyond just the organization's achievements. It's the mission that animates his why, the why he does the essential work in the first place. Dr. Carp believes that Western businesses have an obligation to defend Western values. Let me say that again. They have an obligation to defend Western values, to partner with government, to preserve our security and liberty. And whether we're talking about sustaining our leadership in AI or protecting Americans from harm, we need that spirit of the public private unity to secure our advantage in this very competitive world. Dr. Carp, sir if I could ask you to come forward. We're setting the standard of what a public and private sector should really look like. For your uncompromising belief in American ingenuity and democratic values and to further submit our technological leadership, we are very proud to say congratulations on being in Eisenhower award recipient. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, very cool. Okay, we'll get out of your way. I am first of all to begin with the end of the speech. I'm impossibly honored to be awarded an award that really no one could live up to. First of all, you have my co-recipient who is, when I meet people around the country and in private, you say, well, who do you, you know, there's always discussion, who do you respect most in government? And it's kind of an inside joke. We all start with who do you respect second most? We all have the same person obviously on the list. It's, you know, I don't think anyone in this room needs me to say is tremendously talented force for good and a rare treasure in our government and maybe honestly a source of pain that I hope your future is bright. And so, and then you have Eisenhower, you know, he, son of a man and a knight of religious, German, minority came to America, allied commander, president of Columbia, when our values were in question integrated schools with force became arguably one of the most successful presidents. And then you have the obvious fact that I'm a civilian and I've never served and not put myself in harm's way and no civilian really earns an award that you have served deserve. So, it's a, it's an interesting place to be awarded an award that you possibly could not possibly have earned. And I asked myself, you know, then how are why am I, I'm here? And truth is, when I got this email saying I'd won this award, I kind of turned the page. That's exactly as like, well, it's kind of used to getting awards I might not actually want or maybe I deserved. And, you know, there's this famous Groucho Marx thing, I would never join a club that had me as a member, what about getting an award that you possibly could never have deserved to get? Now, I'm deeply honored and I'm a little bit under the weather and, and I'm legitimately introvert and I would have used any excuse and any other award in the world I would have canceled. And sent in a video. But I didn't, I didn't think I could do that. And I, you know, I always think there's, there's a lot of things and I want to get to one of my favorite, a couple of my favorite riffs, most of which have gotten me pilloried or attacked and, and, and, and, and public that I'm proud of. But I, I would say that for me, you know, there's always these memories you have as a young adult or as an adult. And my first, and then, I think these memories actually, in my life, have played a big role. The, the, one, the first memories not that related to this, but it did affect building the business, which was I remember is sitting there thinking I'm, I'm massively dyslexic and how can I escape my dyslexia. And if I could, I would be very successful. And that worked out. And, and then my other, other one of my other formative memories I was working, I did a PhD and I had this office and it was basically I got a job in Germany, which is nearly impossible. I was like the re-immigrated immigrant. So I had like eight jobs. And I, every when anything had to happen, I did all of it. So I wrote the papers. I wrote everything. It was like only one honestly working. And, and so, and in, in the place I worked at the Civilian Foreign Institute, there were these double doors and a red light. And they told you when you started the Civilian Foreign Institute, you can literally do anything. You will never be fired, but you can never go in the room when, when the, the door is closed and the red lights on. And they were a little graphic about all things you could do and nothing would happen to you. I won't go into that civilized audience. But, and I sat there and it's almost all my reading. Unfortunately, I have since I've been building Poundary of Reading Less. But, and I sat there and I thought about a lot of things and one of the things I thought about the most was why did young men from Iowa and Kansas risk their lives knowing they could die to free Europe and to free people like me. And I, I, so moved. And I think about those people a lot. Of course, at the time, it was mostly young men, now it's men and women. You know, I built products I'm proud of, actually changed the course of history by stopping terror attacks and augmenting several liberties and has protected our men and women on the battlefield. And, and, and also have taken the lives of our enemies and I don't think that's something to be ashamed of. I, and, and I, I always think when, you know, you build a business and I'm very proud of our business and I'm very proud of Poundarians and they may actually deserve this award. And, but, you know, you think about these people, they're going out and they're married and they have kids and they're going into battle and they may not come home. And you just, you know, it's like, yeah, I'm building a business and I'm very proud of it and I, I, I, I, we have, you know, especially currently on the battlefield, the central advantage the US has is software empowered hardware systems and software and I'm proud that PoundCheers has been at the forefront of them. I'm also proud that we've dragged and kicked and conjoiled and humiliated and that many people in the corporate world to participate. And now there's a tech ecosystem and we were at the beginning to use the language of Poundarians. We are the OG and very proud of that. The, but, but we are not the people who like people in this room who are going out and know they may not come home and that's a very special thing and I'm proud to support you. Very proud. And I would, I would tell you that pride seeps into a lot of things and part of the reason we're doing so well and commercial is we are very aligned with the people we serve. But it also quite frankly seeps into a lot of the positions that we take internally and externally. You know, we were, I was the first CEO to go to Ukraine. I, we do not believe in appeasement. We've publicly stood up for Israel. We, you know, I often find that people, some people, want to appease in Europe, some people want to appease in Tehran and it doesn't work. And it, and, and one of the things I've been yelled at currently for is particularly in, in, what they call themselves progressive. I, I actually am a progressive. I want less war. You only stop war by having the best technology and by scaring the bjburs. I'm trying to be nice here out of our adversaries. If they are not scared, they don't wake up scared, they don't go to bed scared. They don't fear that they, that the wrath of America will come down on them. They will attack us. They will attack us everywhere. And the, the idea that is being prevailed at our elite institutions by once progressive now conformist purveyors of what I call a thin religion and it's religious in the sense that every failure proves that it could succeed if you only try it again. And it's not going to work. And we in the corporate world must stand up to this. We must stand up to this. This is not a side show. If we do not win the battle of ideas and reassert basic norms and the basic obvious idea that America is a noble, great, wonderful aspiration of a dream that we are blessed to be a part of. We will have a much, much worse world for all of us, including. And I'm going to a final note for reasons that are impossible for people to explain outside of America. We are a blessed with a tech ecosystem that it rivaled by none. And a government duck back is here and others that is beginning to accelerate and embrace technology. Our adversaries, Americans often underestimate how good we are at software and AI. But our adversaries do not. Their pound share has no adversarial competition in software, in managing software, in AI, in AI, systems or anything like that. And we have to double down on these things. Something like 86% adjusted by market cap percent of the top 50 tech companies in the world are American. And we just have to take our advantages and double and triple down on them and fight for that and fight to integrate these technologies, invest in the things that we are better at. Don't compete with your adversary, use technologies and you're at your advantage to out, to beat them without entering a useless competition. And then again, last, not least, we have to, we in the corporate world have to grow a spine. It's interesting and private, private people agree. And it's easy, Eisenhower is also president of Columbia, it's a long way. And it's easy to blame the students but then no one stands up and says, well this is idiotic and wrong. And so with that, a quote from Eisenhower, you know, the history, he said, of free men, we'll say free people, it's never really written by chance, but by choice, their choice. And it's our choice. I'm honored that I was part of this choice. I'm honored to be in front of this room. It's one of, if not the greatest honor that I and I accept the word for Palaterians who co-built the company with me. And obviously, as I mentioned in a modest role, vis-a-vis the people here who really deserve these awards. And thank you for your time and thank you for honoring me.
