TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning everyone and welcome to AIPCON 8. My 
name is Jack Dobson, AIP lead here at Palanteer and it's my absolute pleasure to welcome you to 
the show. For those of you that are returning, welcome back. Those of you that are new to 
the show, thank you so much for joining us. We have a great morning's content lined up 
for you. A whole set of customer keynotes, including also our CEO, Dr. Karp, taking to 
the stage. But before any of that, we have a very special pre-show to kick off the show. I am 
delighted to be joined with two of my colleagues from Andretti Global. We've got Zack Porter, 
senior simulation engineer within Indie Car, and then Carl Kirkwood, Indie Car driver with 
the team. Thank you so much, guys, for joining me. Thank you for having us. Awesome. So, we're 
going to be kicking off the show with a little bit of a run through and actually a launch of the 
partnership between Palanteer and Andretti. We're going to be showcasing some of the work we've been 
building over just the last few weeks and setting a vision for what we're going to go and achieve in 
2026. So with that, let's hop into a little demo and we're going to actually drive all of this by 
showcasing some of the work we've been building together. Perhaps Zach, do you want to kick us 
off? Introduce us to the world of Indie Car, the world of Andretti, and kind of the beginnings 
of our partnership. Yeah, so Indie Car is uh it's 11 teams. It's 27 full-time entries, 33 at 
the Indy500. We compete on road courses, street courses, short ovals, speedways, this 
massive amount of data, this massive different kinds of racing and all across the globe uh with 
massive number of variables. Uh and and all that we have to work together to make decisions in in 
in real time really really really quickly between sessions. Um it it's quite a challenge. That's 
incredible. And obviously I mean as with a lot of the challenges we face out in the field like 
this is a heavy data challenge, right? So Carl, for you I'm curious like as we think about 
we're going to be talking a lot about data, a lot about workflows and things like that. As the 
race weekend progresses, like how is it for you? Like what's the progression of the weekend? How do 
you think about the technology and the data you're working with? And I guess what's the experience 
from the driver side of all of this? Yeah, I mean there's so much to experience and and I don't 
even know where to start if I'm being honest, but um as a driver you don't get a lot of time to to 
look over things. you are um between media events, you're driving the car, you're or meeting with 
sponsors, um partners, uh whoever it might be, and you get a very short period to actually focus 
on the data that's in front of you. And um you're you're typically always trying to find lap time. 
You're always looking at sectors. You're looking at uh speed traces, throttle traces, brake traces, 
steering traces, and and trying to understand where you can find lap time because ultimately 
everything leading up into the race is is all about just how can you make a car go as fast as 
possible around a single lap or a single sector. So for us, it's it's focusing on that, trying to 
find exactly how we can optimize the corners, the speeds, everything um for a driver standpoint, but 
also for the car. So, um, it's really important and and we like like Zach just said, we have so 
much data to look at and it's crucial to pinpoint and find exactly what you need, but there's also 
so many variables, right? So, a lot of times you'll look at a a portion of data and then you 
also need to um compare it to another portion of data and you kind of just keep falling down rabbit 
holes um trying to understand things and there's always questions and we always run out of time and 
that that's ultimately our our sport, right? It's time. It's it's time on the racetrack. It's time 
looking at data. It's time in in every format. So, um it's important to get through it quickly to to 
optimize everything. That's incredible. I mean, as you say, it's as much a race off track as it is on 
track. Right. Exactly. Like that is the challenge we're fundamentally solving. So, great segue into 
the problems we're solving together, right? So, this is race OS. This is what we've been building 
over just the last few weeks, right? The last handful of races as we closed out the 2025 
season. Congrats again in the championship. That's incredible. Um Zach, do you want to kind of tee up 
this demo a little bit? talk us through race and we'll also talk through a little bit about how we 
actually went about building this as well. Yeah, so race here is like a it's a central point for 
all the work we do between sessions. So we have, you know, everything from a quick snapshot of 
timing and scoring. In the bottom left corner, maybe some actions uh in the bottom right there 
of of sensor anomalies or some things that come up that we need to take action on. You know, 
in the top right, we have weather information, a countdown to the next session, um outings along 
the left hand side, and then a series of of apps along the left that are all the workflows that 
we need to work through to get from where we are right now and make decisions for the next session. 
100%. And as always, like with any race, this is now just a timing game to see how long it takes 
me to say the word ontology. And that is exactly what we're going to start by talking about. So 
obviously everything with regards to race OS, everything we've built is built on Andrett's 
unique ontology, right? That is the coalescing of the data, the logic, the actions that make up 
the team and every single decision you make off and on track. So maybe like Zach, talk me talk 
to me a little bit about the kind of systems that you're working with, how you work with data 
within the team, and I guess what were some of those challenges that we went in to go and solve? 
Yeah, I mean part of the big problem we have is we we have a ton of data and we're really good with 
data. We have a ton of tools and we've been doing this a very long time as as my colleagues say 
we we're big data before big data was a thing sometimes uh and we're really good at that but 
it it sits in silos and it sits in buckets and it sits in in unconnected ways. So timing and 
scoring comes from Indie car but you know data and telemetry comes from the car and those two things 
are not directly connected in any way. And what Foundaries allowed us to do is is create those 
connections to all these like unique individual buckets of of data and serve them all up in one 
way and in in relationships that make sense. Yeah, 100%. So that's obviously where it starts, right? 
You start with the data component of that sort of holy trinity. So this is our broader ontology. 
This is the circuitry behind the entirety of race and as we dive in, we'll see that data component 
to begin with. So you can see obviously we're not thinking about spreadsheets. We're not thinking 
about data sets. We're thinking about the the sort of concepts and the entities you work with 
on a day-to-day basis, right? You got the tracks, the drivers, the sessions, lap times, performance. 
Like this basically allows the team to stop thinking about, oh, where do I need to go to get 
to that information and instead everything is connected, contextualized. So, I mean, Zach, kind 
of what's your thoughts around how this is going to speed up operations for the team? For us, we we 
need to serve like kind like kind like kind like kind like kind like kind like kind like kind like 
kind like kind like kind of like Kyle said too, we need to serve all of these disparate pieces of 
data up in one way to allow our race engineers and performance engineers and systems engineers to 
make decisions quicker. So as we connect these things, you know, tracks to sectors to sessions 
to timing to setups to all the important pieces of our puzzle if we can serve them up in one 
way and present them to our race engineers, we can be more informed to make better decisions 
sooner. 100%. And I think that's also where AIP comes in, right? The ability to not only just 
have the data, but also then start adding logic, layering logic on top of that information so 
we can actually start getting closer to driving decisions, right? KL, I'm curious for you like if 
you put yourself in the position of you've just come straight off track, right? you're in that 
time between sessions. I've seen you you sit down in the engineering truck, you sit with the team 
and start digging through what just happened, right? What did we learn? How to improve for the 
next session. Talk me through some of that process in your mind. Like what kind of things do you want 
to see? How do you go about sort of evaluating what just happened? Well, it it solely depends 
on how you do in a session, of course. Um, but I would say in in general, you're always looking at 
teammates data and um, there's many many sensors that we can look at as as drivers comparative 
to to our teammates. We get raw data from there, but you also look at telemetry, GPS data from 
other cars that we can also get from from the series. And um, you kind of use both of those 
along with some some video as well. You kind of go back to the raw formats of of things, right? 
where you're just looking at offtrack video, um, car on boards from the broadcast even. Um, 
just a combination of many things that if you're looking for one piece of you, you typically start 
with the data. You start with the data compared to teammates or data compared to another car and then 
you find that and you're like, okay, what's going on here? Why why do we need to find pace here? 
And then you translate that into video, um, oncar or incar footage, I should say, um, broadcast 
footage, whatever it might be. and then you try and just put the whole picture together. Um, so 
you're always just bouncing around from a lot of different things to to find out exactly what you 
need for pace in the race car. And and our our job with that on the engineering side is to take his 
sensations and his view and the things his talents in the race car and turn that into data and and 
find actions in the data that back up what he said and helps us understand with context the the level 
of of under steer that we need to fix or the level of power down problems or whatever it might be. 
So we can um make a datadriven decision to to help him go faster. Makes total sense. And that action 
component exactly is the next piece of this, right? The ontology is it's data, it's logic, 
but it's also the ability to take action on that information as well. So a lot of what we've been 
building is really kind of empowering your team, right? Like we're not looking to replace people 
like you guys, as you said, are extremely adept at working with this data. This is about getting 
the right data into users hands quicker. And these applications you see on the screen is just a 
subset of all the apps we've built, right? Like tell me more Zach about like some of the pace 
that you've seen and actually building this out. We've been working together for a handful of 
weeks, right? Yeah. I mean truly we spent about I don't know 5 days getting all the different data 
sources connected and and and streaming in and then from there we've we've had some use cases 
with our systems engineers for example just fall out and and build something uh that they can take 
action on in like 24 hours. That's the that's the power of this whole thing is once we get all the 
data in, once we once we understand really what the end goals are, some some applications just 
kind of fall out of the bottom and usefulness just comes right away. That's incredible. So, 
speaking of that, we're sort of in the context now of we are 30 minutes, just over 30 minutes 
out from the race. We're thinking about car setup, right? Like that's step one of this. How do we 
start applying everything we've learned not just this weekend, but also previous weekends at 
the same track. How do we pull that together to start configuring the car to perform as best as 
possible on track? So what we see here is actually we're looking at one particular setup that we've 
run in the past and you can see we've even got our own Kyle represented in the ontology but we've 
also got your performance on track your laps your segment times as you mentioned and of course even 
your commentary there so every driver comment we get every engineering change made as a result of 
those comments it's all captured that ontology and this view I actually kind of like the ability 
to see like if we focus in on Kyle you can see all of that context that with just one click you 
can jump to right so I mean Zach how would this have worked in the past like if you wanted to jump 
from Kyle to like show me every race, every timing performance, every sector. Like what would that 
have looked like previously for a while? That's really difficult. Um yeah, in the past, you know, 
we we have like a setup database that has setups that have been run that is broken down across 
tracks and years and and sessions and drivers and uh you know, then a different database that has 
timing and scoring information. And so you'd have to one by one in all these different programs, 
go to different places and try and drill down to find, you know, there's not even an easy way to 
search like, hey, what's the fastest we've ever been around this track? uh you kind of have to 
just know that and then go to that session and find that setup and find that information and then 
navigate somewhere else to find all the timing and scoring data and navigate to a different program 
to find all the time series data that's associated with that and that's what we're trying to make 
those connections here. Yeah, makes total sense and I think that's also a good segue there of 
like you mentioned you just have to sort of know that that kind of intuition you're running 
on. So the way I've certainly thought about it is like how do we bring more of the data backing 
more of the actual like datadriven insights and actions beyond just ins uh the sort of intuition 
that you guys have built because obviously you've got a ton of experience but this is about backing 
it up with the right data and also identifying the things that you may have missed right like 
what are those things kind of in the gaps in the noise that you may not have otherwise spotted so I 
guess Carl for you as well like as you think about working with this data and say you're literally 
30 minutes out from a race session like where's your mind at and also what are you thinking 
about what do I need to know to perform as good as best as possible in this next session? 
Well, I mean that that's a great question, right? It depends which session you're going into, 
but I'd say into the race, we're we're focused a lot on the actual strategy of the race and how is 
it going to play out? How can we run the fastest, say 80 laps from from the green flag to the 
checkered? And and a lot of that comes down to tire de uh fuel saving uh performance. When 
when is the car fast? When is the car slow? How is traffic going to be involved in your race? How 
how are um at what point are pit stops going to be the the fastest time to to to optimize your 
race? Right? So you're you're there's a lot of variables that that you're trying to pull together 
and you're trying to understand it, but a lot of things change as the race um progresses, right? 
So understanding how um the race progresses and how things may change also dictates a lot of of 
how you're ultimately going to end up in a race, right? And um trying to understand those things 
is extremely important. Yeah, 100%. And and Zach, we were talking about this earlier, but I think 
as we look at this view on the screen now, we've actually like the system AIP has assisted us with 
finding four potential setups that we can compare, right? I think the cool thing about this 
is when we start to layer in AIP as well, you start pulling out some of those proactive 
insights of here are the things that have happened in the past, things that you may have forgotten, 
yellow flag in that session or that person going off track or whatever it is. What the system 
can actually do is pull all of that information together alongside the setup data to actually 
contextualize it with performance information with session information beyond just trying to remember 
why did we run that setup. You now have everything at your fingertips, right? So talk me through how 
you're thinking about this helping the team in the future. Yeah, I mean this particular view here has 
as along the left the fastest lap we've ever run around and the setup associated with it that we've 
ever run around Long Beach in this particular case. Uh and in the in the previous slide, we were 
searching for something, you know, a setup change that maybe Kyle or or Jeremy as race engineer 
have gone through and something that they want to explore for this next session. And this AIP 
has has gone through and found inside our database three setups that are very similar to that change 
that they wanted to make and all the associated data that is that that's with that. So we have the 
setup differences that are listed here and then down below there's also the key metrics that are 
associated with that. Um and it's it's it's quite a powerful tool to really quickly drill down. We 
we had no way to do this before. No way of like making a setup change or proposing a setup change 
and then understanding all the things that go along with that that we've ever done historically. 
That's a brand new tool for us. That's awesome. That's incredible. So, I think what we're going 
to see now is obviously that was all the setup information that we quite rightly have hidden from 
the audience a little bit. We don't want to give away the secret source, but you can see all of 
those parameters, right? The difference here, the deltas from session to session. This is all well 
and good like it's useful seeing that comparison, but I think it's then how do you actually apply 
logic on top of that, right? It's not just show me the delta, but show me maybe some of the context 
behind some of that delta, right? Like why did you make those decisions? Yeah, each each of those 
setups were run in different years and different sessions in different conditions. Uh, and the 
ability for AIP to go through and and provide the context like we see here on the left. So that's 
a specific setup picked, but then it provides the story of how we got there. So each outing in 
that session that led up to this, its performance relative to the field, which is the second part 
we see there. Uh, and then its comparison to the reference, the fastest time we've ever gone around 
that racetrack. and what things are different and what things sort of tell the story of why this 
is maybe a good direction to go or maybe why it's a bad direction to go. Exactly. And talk me 
through I know I've heard you in the truck a few times be like I remember we did this last year 
or I remember we ran this setup or something like that. Like are you often just going off like 
oh what did we do last time what worked? What didn't? Like how do you think this would change 
maybe your flow getting ready for a session? You know it's extremely interesting looking at at 
some of this stuff right and and talking about it beforehand in this in this pre-show. It's there's 
a lot of bins in in silos as you said that that information um topics, setups, everything is kind 
of spread out and we're always finding that we have to go to a different folder, a different a 
different area or a different server to to find things that we want. And simplifying it and 
putting it all in one spot saves us so much time. And I go back to the time that it that our 
our whole motorsports career is about. counts, you know, every minute counts. Off the track, on 
the track, everything is is important and it just it allows us to make more educated decisions um 
with with valid information. That's awesome. So, I think what we're going to do now is we're 
going to segue. So, like this was all pre-race, right? Like we're looking ahead of Long Beach, 
which was a race of the season, which actually Carl won. Not to give away the lead there. Um but 
I think what's important is okay, great. We've got our setup down. We can obviously capture that 
in the ontology. Then we transition to postra, right? Like so obviously we get the car ready, 
we optimize the setup going into the session. That's all well and good. What you can see here is 
we're actually capturing all of that those setup decisions and all the edits that have been made in 
the ontology. So it's you're continually adding to those breadcrumbs, right? Like adding to the asset 
that you have to draw upon next time. I think where this gets particularly exciting is when we 
start to get into the more telemetrydriven stuff, right? As we start to think about sensors, 
how the car is performing. So, as we now kind of transition to that post-race, you can see 
there KL, you're you're at the top of the timing stands. That's pretty good. Um, now the next 
stage is like, well, what worked, what didn't, how did the car perform, and what can we learn 
from for next time. And I think we've built some pretty cool stuff around session review. So, 
Zach, talk me through some of the behind the scenes of how we went around building this and I 
guess also like how's this compare to how you guys work with particularly tire information and tire 
sensor based data today. Yeah, when when we get to post session, we have this dump of data that's 
arrived in all these different forms. Uh and and all of them represent a performance or a piece of 
performance of the car and and and how tells the story of how we can go faster someday. Um so this 
session review piece, specifically this view with with tire information here, helps us understand 
like how we're developing grip over the lap, over a session. Um and and all this stuff is is 
coming in automatically in the background and it's ready within two or two or three minutes from post 
session. Um, that's really the powerful thing is is being able to just serve this information 
up right away instead of our tire engineer, for example, having to go and calculate these 
reports and put this stuff together and then it gets sent out 30 or 40 or 50 minutes later and 
it gives us a significantly less amount of time to take action upon it. How do you actually think 
that's going to compare then? You mentioned they like it could take 10, 20, like an hour tops to 
actually coales this information. When you've got these I mean we've got some great custom widgets 
here that actually kind of show that information in the format that your users your team are 
familiar with. like in terms of the time cut down, what do you expect like the impact of this is 
going to be? I I think what what it really does is it allows our our engineering group, you know, 
his Kyle's race engineer and and Kyle to sit down and and in five or six minutes as they sort 
of debrief in detail with themselves from the session to immediately go and like, hey, like what 
happened with tire pressure? What happened with the tire temperatures? You know, why did I have 
this sensation of over steer after three or four laps? Like what what was the temperature 
distribution front to rear of the tires, for example, or something? And it just serves 
that information right away. So as they debrief from the session, they can answer their own 
questions right away. We we find that a lot of times we we we just don't have time to look at 
things like this, right? We we there's a lot of important things to look at and it's kind of in in 
order what you should be looking at. And a lot of times some of this stuff falls behind. So having a 
clearcut um informative place to just click on it, review it within seconds, and then get out of 
it and understand it is absolutely crucial for between sessions, right? A lot of times we don't 
find things until after a race or after a session at night when engineers are staying up till 
midnight looking at things. So um it's extremely interesting and what we saw there in the previous 
screen was actually some of your comments right you've got the evolution of your comments coming 
out of the car the changes that the engineers have made as a result and then you can actually 
see that outing to outing right so KL how do you think about communicating with your team right I 
know that there's a lot of nuance around like you could say oh this doesn't feel great this doesn't 
feel good but you're always thinking about how can I give my team the right information for them 
to take the right action so how do you think about that when communicating with the team on 
track of Of course. And and you you want to give them simple um terms that they can understand 
where you talked about over steer, under steer, um things that are just going to help the balance 
of the car that you know intuitively that that will make it faster. And that that's kind of 
just kind of the seat of the pants of the driver, but you also want it to correlate directly with 
what the data says. And um it's important that you that you compare each one of those and understand 
that because a lot of times you can find yourself where the data completely contradicts what the 
driver says. And that is a pretty disappointing thing as a driver if I'm being honest. Um 
because usually the data is right. So, so you're always trying to wanting or you're always 
wanting to match those things up. And when you do match them up, which is 90% of the time I would 
say, um you usually get good things out of it. That's awesome. And on that note, talking of data 
and like backing up your commentary, let's talk sensors for a second. We've done a lot of work to 
pull in all of the telemetry coming off the car. I think this is amassed something like a quarter 
of a trillion data points that we're working with within the platform. Just got started. Just got 
started. Yeah, this is like days weeks in. I we actually ran this little experiment in Nashville 
just last weekend when we saw that the time it takes for you to walk from the timing stand on 
the pit wall back to the garage. In that time, all of that data is flowing off the car into the 
platform and actually contextualizing within that within that ontology ready to start working with. 
So, Zach, I mean, that's firstly insane. It's just so impressive we'd be able to do that so quickly. 
How do you think that's going to transform the way that Andretti operates? I mean, the big challenge, 
especially with the time series data that we have, is it comes in these big chunks, these big splats 
between between outings. Uh, and there's over 2,000 channels of data in there and and much of 
it is things that we don't necessarily need or they are channels that are calculating something 
that we need further downstream that help that help us inform. You know, Kyle's talking about a 
a high-speed imbalance and we go look at the the center of pressure of the car and understand 
where the aerero balance of the car is. Um, and so making sure that that data is accurate 
and is not having failing sensors or or missing stuff. You know, these these are not gentle road 
cars that drive around all day. These are race cars that are smashed around the racetrack and 
occasionally crash. And it's a never- ending battle, unfortunately. It's a never- ending battle 
to keep every sensor on the car in prime condition and operating correctly. And and that's the the 
biggest challenge of this kind of data. Yeah, that's incredible. And K, I mean, I guess for you 
as well, I think we've we've talked a lot about how do we make sure that that data is in the best 
possible form, right? Like everything's working, you're getting all the telemetry you need. Like 
how does that I guess that makes a massive impact for you, right? When you have those that stuff to 
hand ready to use as quickly as possible. Yeah, certainly. Right. And there's always questions 
whether the data that you're looking at is correct or or incorrect, and you're always basing it off 
of multiple other sensors kind of around the car to just correlate and tie the whole picture 
together. So, um, yeah, you you and that goes back to what I'm talking about like in between 
sessions where you look at one thing, you're like, "Okay, I see this is what's happening, but what 
what is happening here and what's happening here?" And you're always you're always kind of tying 
the whole picture together. So, to to have a data point that is that you know is accurate 
and you know you can trust is something that also saves time for us, right? And and it's very 
important for performance. That's awesome. And I think the big thing for us, and I know I've been 
working with the team a lot on this, is okay, it's one thing seeing the data. It's one thing having 
visibility, but it's really about being proactive around like what can we alert upon, like what can 
we actually push to the team proactively to say, hey, this is something you should take a look at. 
So, I mean, tell me the story, Zach. We built this tire pressure and monitoring system workflow, 
right, where we were building off some of those tire sensors that we're working with to actually 
identify anomalies and even like something around battery levels, right? So, tell me a bit of the 
story about how this workflow came to be. Yeah, we we were at Toronto uh and and struggling. 
Actually, Kyle's car specifically in a session had a TPMS sensor that failed. Um and that that 
that sensor tells us not just the tire pressure, but tire temperatures and all kinds of things that 
represent performance. Um and when that fails, that that's a huge bit of information that he 
doesn't have, that we don't have that we can't make decisions on. So, uh uh Joe and and the group 
kind of overheard this challenge. And because we were already scooping the data up, because we were 
already parsing it and and doing all the things we were, they in about 24 hours, we're able to to 
push this app out to our systems engineers to help them see the status of every sensor that's ever 
been on the car, when the last time it was run, all the times it was run, what its battery 
level was, and a little prediction of of when that battery might get to a place where they got 
to take it out of service. And and truthfully, since then, since Toronto, Kyle's not had a single 
TPMS problem on the car because of this app. We've we've been able to to to peel the sensors out at 
the right time and replace them with new ones. That's awesome. And I think it also speaks to 
a little bit of our approach of building with Andretti, especially in these last few weeks where 
once you get that foundational ontology down, the ability to very quickly stand up new solutions, 
new apps, like we hear a bit of feedback from the team, we implement it 24 hours later or even 
less. Like it's kind of enabling the team to move faster, right? Like obviously challenges 
are always showing up and the nature of your performance on track, the evolution of the season, 
the team is constantly evolving, right? So, it's a little bit like how do we keep pace with 
that and build to exactly what the team needs at any given point, right? Yeah. And I and I think 
like things like this, our systems engineers are really good. They're really bright. They they they 
keep the car in a really good running condition, but there are so many sensors and there's so much 
stuff that humans are bound to miss something. But if we if we can peel them up and and and serve 
them better information sooner, they're happier. Awesome. That's perfect. So to wrap us up, I think 
we're going to be talking a little bit about some of that anomaly detection. Like what are those 
things that we spot where okay, obviously the the tire battery stuff, pretty simple, like go change 
this, go solve this problem. I think as you start to talk about identifying those sensor anomalies 
and those sort of behaviors that are maybe harder to deduce like what exactly is going on, we're 
building more of a sort of investigation workflow around that, right? So I guess like Zach, tell 
me a little bit more about how like when you see that behavior like how did you work with that data 
previously? How would you go through that process? And as we see in the demo, like how is that going 
to change when building a palenteer? Yeah. So, so the the current workflow would be every time a a 
data file comes off the car, the systems engineer is going to page through very quickly by eye and 
just make sure that all the critical sensors, all the things that we were testing, everything was 
working and in working order. And they're humans, so we're going to miss things. Um, so if we 
can add some some machine learning on top of that to help flag things that that h that maybe 
just failed for a split second on a lap that we weren't particularly looking at, we can flag that 
to go investigate eventually. Uh, I I think that's that's really powerful. And then from there, we 
can drill down into like here's all the anomalies we saw. Here's how many of them there were. Here's 
the corner they keep showing up on. You know, can we can we flag that for someone else to follow up 
with later. Is there a a build of the car that we have to move around in a different way uh to to to 
prevent these problems from happening? And I think that's the that's the beauty of of this deeper 
dive. That's awesome. And it's actually a perfect segue as we sort of start to wrap up thinking 
about 2026, right, Carl? As I mentioned, solid performance this championship really exciting to 
see the speed that the team's moving at. How does that set you up for the 26 season, right? Like 
what some of the focuses, what's top of mind for you in terms of improvement. Yeah. What does the 
the next few months look like in the offseason? Well, we're in a constantly evolving sport. You 
always need to progress. You always need to get better. And we have a long time to do that now. 
And and things like this will help us immensely. And for me as a driver, I'm always just trying 
to figure out, okay, what what is our what is our best tracks? Yeah. How do we improve on that? How 
do we continue down this route? And then also what is our worst tracks and how can we adjust to make 
those better? So, um that's really the the topic of of focus um for the offseason for us. Awesome. 
And Zach, final remarks from you. What are you most excited about looking forward to the next 12 
months with Palanteer? I I think the the workflows that we can build that we can uh take some time 
away, get our race engineers specifically to go to bed a little earlier and not be staying up so 
late so they're not so cranky the next morning. Um and and and help them make better decisions cuz 
winning races is why we're here. That's awesome. Well, K's going to be upset I got him up bright 
and early for little pre-show. But honestly, guys, thank you so much for joining us. This 
has been great fun. Great to work through all the work that we've built so far in just a few 
short weeks. I've never been more excited for the next season. Honestly, it's only the start, 
too. It's only the start, literally. Um, well, with that, thank you so much, everyone at home for 
tuning in. This is only the start of the show. Do not go anywhere. Thank you so much for joining 
us. This is AIPCON 8. Thank you for watching.
