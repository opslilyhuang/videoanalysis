TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I like sometimes playing around with this and telling like, little prank or a joke, it's not true, but the real, the real way that I got my name is that my dad used to come home from work and pat my mom's pregnant tummy and say, how's my little tiger? And that's the story that everyone just goes, oh, it's so cute. I mean, that is so cute. Do you have any siblings or other animals? Not other animals, I've got a brother called Biff. So I grew up in the UK in East Anglia, in a small town, a seaside town called Loastoft. I spent the first 18 years in my life there and just doing, went to a state school and just did maths, further maths, physics and chemistry at A levels. And then I came to university in London. I studied at Imperial College London and studied computer science there. For four years I did an integrated masters studying that. So nice light start on the education to life. Just a couple of, you know, easy courses to get on with. Let's make it to Imperial. Is that where you hear about Palanta? How do we get from Imperial to Palanta? Yeah, so in my second year at Palanta, there's a guy from Defence called Guy who came and gave a big presentation about Palanta. Imperial hosted these events on a pretty regular basis where different tech companies could come in and give a presentation or do a workshop. And the guy from Defence was giving a presentation about Gotham. And I remember just being sat there in the audience just looking at this Gotham demo being like, wow, this is such an amazing software, this is so cool. I want to work on this, I want to work with it. And that was kind of where I first heard about Palanta, yeah. Awesome, so you apply? Why don't you tell me a bit about that process? Sure, so I actually applied to Palanta for five years in a row. That first year when I've heard about Palanta, it was my second year of union, I was applying for an internship. I didn't quite meet the criteria because you had to be in your penultimate year and I had two more years to go. So then I try again in my third year and didn't make it past that one. So then I applied again in my fourth year, didn't make that one. And then I graduated, applied again when I joined my first graduate job. Didn't make that one. And then finally after five years, I made it and got the offer to join as an FDRE. Which I have now. What was it that made you apply five years running? It wasn't just a software, you know, when I sort of got them and I thought that was super cool, like that was great, but I think it was just the nature of the forward deployed role. I haven't seen anywhere where you can be that close to customer, you can be as involved, but also get to do a lot of really cool problem solving and engineering. And that's what appealed to me at the time. Oh, I mean, still does. You entered under this title. How does that look relative to the standard FDE role? With a lot of the day-to-day stuff, I think it's very similar. It's basically equivalent to a delta. I applied to delta. For all of those five years, I was applying to the role of a delta. It was only in that last time that I applied. After the onsite, I got redirected, had a slightly different final hiring manager interview and then made it in as an FDERE. The role itself is pretty new. Less than three years old, I think. And I think we're still figuring out what the definition of it is. We have a little Slack channel for FDERE's. Shout out to the FDERE channel. We have some interesting discussions on there. There was actually an FDERE show and tell this morning. We do monthly ones, which is quite fun. What's the experience like compared to the expectation? Well, when I joined Palinta, I got a signed a mentor who was also an FDERE and he wasn't really sure what an FDERE was meant to be either. So I kind of asked him and his main answer, which kind of stuck with me, was that roles mean nothing really in Palinta. You forge your own, everyone forges their own path. I think that's kind of what I've done my best to do. And we had lunch together and this is in the middle of the cafeteria in London. And I felt like we couldn't get through our lunch because so many people came up and had different things to say to you. Maybe it was arranging to grab a coffee, something to do with work, something about the living situation. I think there was one more. Maybe you can talk a bit about that network piece or how you thought about building connections outside maybe the immediate work. I mean, first of all with a name like Tiger, it comes as standard that everyone wants to come up to and say your name. But I think in honesty, the real thing that's built my network is kind of a desire to jump in and help at any point. There's a lot of times when people feel snowed under and if you know they're the person that you need to talk to that helps sometimes I'll be like I'm really sorry I've got to get this thing done, but it'll help you after and that's fine, right? And I think for me it's like I've often just kind of found a way to drop what I'm doing without like lowering the bar and then help out that person when they need it as much as possible. It's a pretty good mantra to live by. As well as that. I'd also add like whilst that when that network grows you know who knows what and then instead instead of you giving all your bandwidth to help someone you can just point them in the right direction if someone who could do better. Couldn't agree more with that. I feel like part of being a parent here for a while is realizing that there's people who are truly excellent at doing pretty much everything. So you know one of the things that came up the network or at least during that lunch was understanding about your move to the US. I'm wondering if you can talk about that kind of decision-making process and how week one is going. Yeah so I landed in New York just a day and night so it's like five days ago now. I've been on the hospital's impulse for about a month and my initial sort of drive to move to the US. I gained all this health care experience that was super interesting, super fun, super valuable. Following that I transitioned to a few smaller UKG impulse but at a point where I joined my previous UKG impulse I already knew that I was going to be coming to join the hospital's team. The motivation for that was first of all that I was just seeking out more interesting problems and I knew that in the US the complexity of the health care system here was on another level to what we have in the UK and I've seen that over the last month and definitely the last week but for me there's still a lot of untapped potential here in hospitals in the US. I think that was one of my call mode toators. I guess the other call mode toator for me was a cultural one in that having grown up in the UK my whole life. I was really interested to just explore and experience a different culture and I'm getting that for now for sure. Maybe ask me in a few months time finding that and settling in. I can give you a more coherent answer there. Awesome. We'll hear how the US is treating you. Okay so you know you've made a fairly significant life change in pursuit of kind of furthering your Palantir journey and I guess in September you'll be coming up on two years I think. What is it that's kept you interested engaged motivated within that time you know what is it about being here that you like so much. But Palantir we have the closeness. It's literally just the customer and then us the customer tells us their vision. We make that vision a reality within the bounds of what's happening in the jeep and being able to do that is one of the most rewarding things. Second of all it's just everyone here the community, the Palantir community. On my first day within Palantir I was in a room with a Stanford grad and a Harvard grad and I was like and a Cambridge grad actually and I was like wow these people are insanely smart and I was like well yeah I've got to stay here to be surrounded by these amazing people and we'll build each other up you know. Yeah absolutely and I suppose given your really thoughtful effort about getting into Palantir and your experience since you've been here is there any advice you would give to people in that path process now knowing what you know about being inside the company or anything you would have told Tiger on take one to five. I think I personally think that take one to five I had for a reason I was growing in different areas as I sort of accelerated through those different application processes each year. One the first few years it was technical breakthrough I was I was getting better at solving problems doing those leak code hacker rank style things that university kind of teaches you to do and then it became as I moved sort of into the product manager role of Microsoft it became more of a gaining empathy and emotional intelligence and understanding how to talk to clients and customers so I think there was a clear reason as to why I didn't get in for those first five years and I think it's a good thing that Palantir maintains that high a high bar because that's the reason that I was sat in that room with the Harvard grad and the Cambridge grad on my first day right these are people that don't just have academic intelligence as well they they have a lot of emotional intelligence too because they need to be able to empathize with that customer and I think that's quite a reprieve
