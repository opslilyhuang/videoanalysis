TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

You want the code or without the code? You tell me. Far more acágio. I think the code's going to be more charismatic, but I don't take the code without the code. Actually, let's do without the code. Okay, tell me about yourself. I'm Akidich. I grew up in India, go to school in Iowa, study in school. Where did you go school in Iowa? I would stay at Ames. Good. I was suburban. I know Ames. Yeah. And what did you learn there? What do you study? I'm a double major in math and CS with a minor in aerospace. I'm Ethan and I went to Middlebury College, a community college, and Michigan. Oh, wow. Yeah. So how did you go from middle of middlebury, a language school, then to community college? Did you get, like, kicked out? When I went to Middlebury, COVID hit, and I decided to transition to community college, which was actually my favorite educational experience I ever had. I got to work with 40, 50-year-old mothers going back to school. I got to work with people who were of all walks of life. And I feel that in the educational system, we put a lot of emphasis on prestige and percosciousness. And I think that's a mistake. What surprises you about Palantir? I think I thought I knew a lot about Palantir before coming in and to see that it's actually true and implemented on the everyday. So what is true on the everyday? I feel like the how we do things is just very unique and different to anything I've ever experienced. I've worked in like Big Tech before, but this is just a completely new way of giving people responsibility of solving problems. I mean, there's no oversight except from people in your team, right? The only people who are telling you whether you're doing a good job or a bad job, or people who are directly approximate to the problems and the challenges you're facing, which makes sense. I think a lot of the time a traditional hierarchy, someone doesn't actually see what you're doing, and yet they're still telling you whether you're doing a good job or a bad job. I think that my background in jazz music and improvisation and not being, like, trapped into a single box. I think that's somewhere that I've really enjoyed getting to be able to do on my team, but ultimately, your team has to give you the platform to let you do that. What is something technical you've learned that you've applied here? I worked on optimization problems. I worked on building full-stack applications. I worked on bootcams where we're writing linear solver models and within a week. So it's very, very different things. And then all of that in this one internship. I feel like the unsexy-est technical problems have been the most interesting personally. Also, such as data migration. Sometimes it's just a matter of data cleaning that made it impossible for you to be even utilized. Obviously, we're doing a lot of progress in AI and all these fields, but I also think it's really interesting to think about it. The AI won't work unless the data stack is integrated. So when people say that AI doesn't work, it's often because the underlying software doesn't work. Yeah. So helping our clients just be able to leverage their data and make it usable in the first place, I think is really interesting. Is it okay if I ask you a question? Yeah. You asked me one question and then this is we're going to stop. How did you think coming from the background in philosophy helped you lead a company today? And why do you think it makes you different than maybe someone that comes from just a purely technical background? I tend to think the value that, you know, for better or worse, I bought to Palantir is a combination of a moral frame with a certain level of rigor. So like, you know, I don't, I, one of the reasons I'm so critical of things on college campuses, like leaving in the morality aside the rigor. It's like you need to understand the contradictions in your system. And then building an operational culture that is in unison with that so that you attract and retain basically people who want to, you know, it, it, want to become better versions of themselves. How do you become a better version of yourself? You identify what is actually uniquely valuable. You learn how to use that skill in the context of a platform, software, and cultural, where your unique value is shines and is lifts the whole platform because of the enormous strength of your rare talent integrated into, to use your terms, jazz terms, and ensemble. And one of the crazy things about Palantir is like the Palantir degree currently is the most valuable degree in the US bar none. And that what 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, that was not the case. It is the case now.
