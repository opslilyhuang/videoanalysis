TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi everyone, my name is Joe Pachra. I lead the Foundry Development Team at Cabinol Construction. We're a vertically integrated, heavy civil construction company in Ottawa, Canada. We build roads, sewers, subdivisions, homes. We produce our own asphalt, aggregates and concrete. We run hundreds of pieces of heavy equipment and trucks every day. I'm just so excited to get to share with you guys our unique approach to pound your Foundry. As the company grew over seven years so did our systems. Each solving a problem but together created an even bigger one, complexity. We were bending our business to work with off-the-shelf software and feeling this economy is a scale to come with it. We needed a change, interpallant here. So as we began our Foundry journey, every system we connected to highlighted the same thing. This doesn't work the way our business works and it would be so much easier if we just built it in Foundry. So we started asking the question, why don't we just build it in Foundry? So long story short, we've gone all in, so much so that every other software must justify its existence. And so far they haven't been able to. 97% of our employees use Foundry every day. Foundry is our operating system. So what does this look like? We picked a few simple examples to demonstrate how information flows through the ontology, workflow to workflow, powering our day-to-day operations. Here you can see our homepage. We've named the system Total Operations Management or Tom to honor the company's founder, Tom Kavanaugh. We'll navigate here to Global Schedule. This is our scheduling tool that's replaced everything else. P6, Microsoft project, spreadsheets, all of it. You can imagine keeping all those previous tools in sync was a ton of work and of course led to errors. Now we have one plan, one schedule, one source of truth for all our operations in one place. Move an activity and every team knows instantly. And what looks like just a simple puck on the screen is actually packed with information underneath, contract items, production rates, mixed designs, trucking requirements and budgets, all because of the underlying ontology. I was a scheduler for six years and no one has successfully run operations from a critical past schedule, but we've solved it. For the first time, the information flows to the field and the field executes on the same information. Next we have Kavanaugh Connect. This is our OSDK app published in the app stores powered by Foundry. You can see we've got a simple news feed. We can now reach every employee wherever they are. You can imagine this is extremely powerful. Next you can see an example of an employee submitting a time card. All employees now have access to the news feed, time cards, support from HR, payroll and IT right on their phone in their pocket. And just six months ago, this was all done on paper. Thousands and thousands of pieces of paper handled every pay period. Foundry saved us hours and hours eliminating the handling and administration of those paper time cards. Next, site 360. This is a Foundry mobile workshop that's replaced our legacy field time capture app. This is where the form and day comes together. Time cards land here automatically from Kavanaugh Connect. Form and manage production, labor, approve equipment, order trucks, manage the crews, all from their phones. And because the plan data flows to them, they only have to fill in the gaps. What it used to take hours, it only takes 10 minutes because the work and the data move as one through the ontology. Lastly, this is site 360 manager. This is where all the field information flows back into the office. Daily reports, production, labor, equipment, costing, all in one place for managers to review and approve in real time. Whether it's our mobile app, site 360 or global schedule, we're meeting the users where they are. Again, these workflows are simple and that's the point. By eliminating the third-party software we used to use, we've removed so much complexity from our business. No more paper, no more silos. As we zoom out, you start to see the real breadth of our system. These tiles represent the tools we used to run our operations every day. From the contracts that define the work, to the resources we perform that work with, labor, equipment, materials, they're all managed inside foundry, meaning they're fully connected. And when we say one operating system, it doesn't mean we're forcing our users to conform, it's the opposite. Foundry gives us a flexibility to build the way we want and powering our operations. And finally, the engine that powers it all, the ontology. It looks complicated, but in reality, it's just big. It's big because it's the digital representation of our business. Every employee, every truck, every piece of equipment, every job is in here. You can imagine how hard this was to maintain with our legacy siloed systems. Every line you see here represents what used to be a phone call, an email, a text, or someone driving paper around a job site. Historically, collecting this data was hard work, unfairly punishing operations. But when you build this way, collecting the data stops being work, and becomes an output we call for free, just by doing the job. And what you're looking out on the screen is our data. On the left, objects in the middle, and workshops on the right, the ontology is the secret weapon. Nothing else comes close. And not only are we getting rid of third party software, we're actually eclipsing their development. We've replaced their functionality and then beaten them to new features all within the year because of the ontology. So we're honored to show publicly for the first time AIP analyst. We're now able to ask plain language questions about our business and have AI reasoned through the ontology to find the answers. We're already making real-time decisions on information that was previously incredibly difficult to get and took ages to compile. So here, I'm asking analysts a simple question about our fleet, which vehicle requires my attention. This isn't a demo, this is our real data. And you'll see analysts find the truck objects, the inspection logs, the maintenance records, even fault codes, all by following the relationships in the ontology. And so it comes back with eight trucks in repair, three with active faults, and it appears some license for our date. So six months ago, this would have taken ages to compile. But because of the ontology and AIP analysts, we know in minutes. And so while I know these licenses aren't out of date, I asked our fleet manager. What it's actually telling us is we haven't updated this information. It's highlighting something really, really cool about Foundry. You don't have to wait until your data is clean to use Foundry. Use Foundry to clean your data. So, in closing, we've gone from paper to palantir in just under 12 months by replacing disconnected systems with Foundry. Today, real operations run end to end through the ontology, which is why we're seeing the emergence of AI in our operations. We are going to be the first construction company to have true operational AI. We didn't just bring Foundry into our business. We put our business in Foundry. And we're going to prove that you can run your business with nothing but. We're planning for the long term, and we're excited to announce that we're partnering with Palantir to commercialize these solutions across the industry. Together with Palantir, we're raising the ceiling for construction and with it the floor. The fastest route to operational AI is to run your business through it. Go all in. Thank you so much for your time.
