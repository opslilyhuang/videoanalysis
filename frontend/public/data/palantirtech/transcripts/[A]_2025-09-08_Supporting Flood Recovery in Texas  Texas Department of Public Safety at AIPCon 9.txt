TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Please welcome Captain at the Texas 
Department of Public Safety, John Miller. All right, good morning everybody. My name is John 
Miller. I'm a captain with the Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Ranger Division Special 
Operations Group. We are an organization that responds to critical man-made and natural 
disasters across the entire state of Texas, focusing on everything from border security 
operations to hostage rescue events at the tactical level and augmented by our border uh 
border security operations center and joint operation intelligence centers spread across the 
uh Texas border at the operational and strategic level. I'm going to be talking to you about the uh 
runthrough of events leading up to the uh flooding events on the 4th of July in Kirk County. 
Two months ago today, in hours of darkness, there was a massive storm system that gathered 
over Kirk County and dropped a record amount of rainfall in Kirk County. Specifically, the area up 
river of Hunt, Texas, going through the South Fork of the Guadalupe, really starting at Camp Mystic. 
At the time period from midnight to 3:00 a.m., stream velocity rapidly increased in that area, 
going from an average rate of about 50 gallons a second through the South Fork flood gauges 
that we have going up to in the next 3 hours 250 gallons per second. In the next 30 minutes, 
that 250 gallons per second jumped to 125,000 gallons per second, which equates to about 10t of 
flooding in the Kirk County area. However, in the next 30 minutes, that rate increased from 125,000 
gallons per second to 900,000 gallons per second, making a storm system pass through the city of 
Hunt, Ingram, Kurville, Centerpoint, crossing the Kerr, Kendall County line into the city of Comfort 
at approximately 1.7 million gallons per second. That storm system continued its path of travel 
through Kendall County going to the Kendall Kell County line and continuing for an additional 
27 miles before the Guadaloop River dumps into Canyon Lake. With that, we had approximately 
a 127mi area that we needed to work through. And I want to say before I move forward that this 
is all preliminary flood information as academics and experts are still trying to make sense and 
accurately model what happened on the flood event. However, what we do know is that on the morning 
of 4th of July, 39 children lost their lives in the initial storm that came through. Those 39 
uh children ranged in ages of 18 months to 18 years old. Additionally, with that, 80 adults 
were lost. And making this extremely difficult is the three primary loss sites that we had 
during the flood event are all campgrounds that were heavily populated due to the fact that 
it was the 4th of July and people were trying to get riverfront access to planned Fourth of July 
activities in Kirk County. With that being said, 10 foot of flooding in Kirk County when we were 
at the 125,000 gallons per second is somewhat somewhat usual. Uh that area is prone to flooding. 
There have been numerous flooding events. However, this flooding event that came through the area 
was truly truly off the records. I arrived in uh Kurville on the 4th of July where I've been 
in the uh incident command uh role for the entire time. It's my first first two days away from there 
and thank you Palunteer for the opportunity. So, I'm going to talk about what happened uh before 
my arrival on the day of the 4th. At around 4:00 a.m., local first responders and pre-stage 
rescue elements uh activated in response to the flood event. Inaccurate and impartial information 
dominated the space when we first showed up. But through systematic interviews with witnesses and 
survivors, as well as listening to 911 emergency calls, we were able to start reconstructing the 
event. And understandably so with the impartial and inaccurate information as a victim's sense 
of time and space was greatly skewed by the sheer terror of being in a life ordeath situation 
mirrored with the fact that they were working in torrential downpours unable to see other than 
quick flashes of lightning that were going through the area at 4:00 a.m. and uh completely unable 
to notice anything except the audible and visual signatures of being up on the second floor or 
higher elevation of their houses, hearing victims go by and cars with headlights on screaming for 
help and uh trying to reconstruct what had taken place around them. With that information that 
we gathered from those survivors and through teams on the ground reporting back information, 
we're able to realize that the initial modeling on flood levels that we got was was inaccurate and 
flood levels had been on average 30 to 40 ft as it was going through the South Fork AO. As that flood 
continued through the South Fork and met with rock faces and restricted terrain features, reflective 
pressures pushed the flood waters up to as high as 84 feet in some places. And as that flood plane 
opened up and came into the flood plane areas near Kurville, Ingram and Centerpoint, pushed 
out sometimes up to a mile from center line on the river, taking destruction and debris with it. 
Now, what we were able to do with that information was start tracking and guiding the efforts of 
first responders shown behind here uh shown shown behind me in pink to uh direct their efforts 
in our initial early phases of operation. As geography and time increase in any critical event 
management, specifically a multi-jurisdictional, multi- agency response, we need to effectively 
manage the distribution of figuring out victims, survivors, and severe property damage across 127 
river miles. The need to identify and inform these locations was paramount and we needed a tool 
set to accomplish all these system all these tasks systematically without duplicating efforts 
and avoiding circular reporting consistently. The need for a consolidated common intelligence 
and common operating picture was very apparent during initial phases of the operation. The 
DPS tax server and SAROP uh software that we're using to track operations was very effective 
initially. However, these two systems that were the primary sources of information for 
us were not consolidated, were not federated, and were not able to ingest outside data feed 
showing critical information that we needed. For example, maintaining a single source where we 
could track property damage, property locations, and develop a system for granting and receiving 
uh access from property owners uh to go onto their properties and further assess the damage 
and search for victims. through the event at the end of that first week uh extremely chaotic 
high volume of casualties uh coming through the area we were able to uh finally be asked 
by all local, state, and federal leadership, what do you need to continue this colossal task 
of finding these victims? To uh Dr. Karp's point, I was one of those young special forces soldiers 
working Afghanistan that had the fortunate opportunity of utilizing Palunteer to inform where 
my special forces team was operating. And I knew that there was one answer to that question. We 
needed assistance from Palunteer to build a common operating picture that we would use to drive 
future operations. DPS leadership requ uh received that request for support. Contact was made between 
DPS leadership, Mark Bennett, and Laya. And the the ball started moving forward and getting 
Palunteer out to Texas. We wrapped up our initial conversations with Palunteer and that request for 
support at about 7 or 5:00 p. a.m. local time back in Texas. From there, the very next day, engineers 
flew in from Washington DC, New York City, and Rory, Jake, and Patrick joined my team on the 
ground and were sitting next to me in that EOC by 11:00 a.m. With that, they built the entire Gaia 
Foundry instance, you've been seeing behind me, in less than 48 hours. As that 48 hour time period 
passed and the instance was fully mission capable, we began integrating other key stakeholders and 
this platform became the center of gravity not just for a sole agency but for the event overall 
with input from our leadership team, ground units and very critical and very useful injects from the 
Palunteer team. We were able to cons consistently improve and optimize the platform from that point 
forward with every operational day to increase our efficiency in the area of operation. We were able 
to build in systems for indicators and warnings, taking real-time stream information from USGS and 
multiple other sources and monitor and utilize that historic data and real-time variables 
to develop something more than your standard linear regression models and actually do time 
series analysis and ARMA models to figure out where we need to go next and develop a system for 
what needed to happen as the uh as uh follow on rain systems came through the area. As those 
disperate but unified efforts be were able to start visualizing the graphics that we had at 
the micro messo and macrolevel unit of analyses, we were able to begin generating statistical 
analyses as well as predictive analysis for future operational periods. That has allowed 
us to synthesize maritime, ground, and aerial sensors to direct maritime and ground teams in 
their search efforts. The search strategy at this point has been through multiple phases. Putting 
our main search efforts at the highest probability locations guided by uh spatial and temporal 
analysis to place duplicative efforts at all phases of the operation and be able through uh our 
one of our chief investigators, Mr. Don Carter, give the families accurate information about the 
disposition of their loved ones during the event. We were also able to develop a process of 
cleaning that data, finding where uh where we could give information to those families 
and drive that effort forward even further uh integrating in intelligence and investigative 
functions within the team. Palanteer has support us through all five phases of the operation. 
Beginning with our hasty search through the area coming 127 miles in a period of under three and a 
half days with approximately 3,000 rescue efforts that were in the area. We're able to generate and 
manage target intelligence locations based off of reporting back off multiple sensors going into 
a very thorough maritime search of the entire affected AO and leading to our final phase of 
operation where we're working on geoysical data collection sourced from synthetic aperture radar, 
highdensity LAR, high density and highfidelity uh visual uh imagery that's been captured. 
overlay that with magnetometry, thermal scans, and then use ground sensors with ground 
penetrating radar, methane, and LAR to figure out where victims are. So, in in giving 
this presentation and saying everything that I've said up here today, I'd like to close out firstly 
by saying thank you to Dr. Karp and Palanteer. uh before joining the military, before going into 
college and grad school and find my way into DPS and the Ranger Special Operations Group, I was 
raised in Kurville, Texas, uh where my parents, my grandparents still live and several close 
family friends that were lost in the event. So from Kurville and the citizens of Kirk County, 
citizens of Texas, from the unified command, from the search efforts that have been out there 
at the local, state, and then national level as well as the international searchers that have 
come in to help us. Thank you for giving us the unfair advantage as we continue this herculean 
task of finding our last two victims of the 119 victims total. As we found 117 victims in record 
time and uh really outside well above center mass for an event like this, we are still not calling 
this a victory as we still have two victims that are unaccounted for. So to the families of those 
victims, specifically to the the family of Mr. Jeff Ramsay, father who is swept away with his 
wife on the morning of the 4th, and Seal Stewart, a beautiful young 8-year-old camper at Camp Mystic 
that we're still looking for. To her parents, Will and Cece, thank you for trusting us with this 
most important mission that we've had. Thank you for allowing us to bring in all these technology 
sources to search for your loved one and giving us the time and space to employ all these assets 
to bring some resolution. We love you guys. Thank you for trusting us and thank you 
to all the people in this room for helping us continue having that unfair advantage 
and bring these last two home. Thank you.
