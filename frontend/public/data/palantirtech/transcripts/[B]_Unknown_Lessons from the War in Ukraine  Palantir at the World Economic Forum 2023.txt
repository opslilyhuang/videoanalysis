TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning and welcome to the Palantir Pavilion. I'm Ken Weinstein, Distinguished Fellow at Touch and Institute. Our subject this morning is a new age of technology, warfare, and deterrence lessons from the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainians with the support of their Western allies have beaten the odds. And key to Ukraine's success has been its ability to harness cutting edge technology, which has not only changed the dynamics on the battlefield, but arguably is changing the future of deterrence. So I'm honored this morning to welcome Ukrainian Vice Minister Mikhailo Federov here. He is the digital, the minister for digital transformation in Ukraine. He's the youngest minister in the history of, government minister in the history of Ukraine. He took office in 2019, focused on creating kind of an e-governance platform for Ukraine. He's a tech entrepreneur. Before he entered government, he was a digital advisor to the Zelensky Presidential Campaign. And he has had now an enormous role, both as Vice Prime Minister and as minister for digital transformation on the efforts in the battlefield, which we will hear about. And also delighted to be here honored as well to be with two men who, in their own respects, have played a critical role in aiding the valiant Ukrainian people, former Senator Rob Portman, who has traveled to Ukraine somewhere between his staff says 15 times. He thinks it's only been a dozen times. Four times since the war started and was co-founder of the Ukraine Caucus. And Alex Carp, the co-founder and CEO of Pamela Tears. So let me first turn it over to the minister to get your thoughts. And again, we thank you for your time here and we're honored to hear from you. Hello everyone, I will speak with Victor. First and foremost, I'd like to thank the American colleagues like everything that we do again, and I'm still doing for Ukraine. The personal leadership, personally, the leadership shown by this person without exaggeration helped send you to Ukraine. The weapons we were receiving before the invasion and we received after the invasion plus the courage of Ukrainian armed forces continued to play an important decisive role in the war. And we also received the new weapons and our military training. We've been receiving new weapons systems and we have been training our military. And this one, as you know, we're getting Patriot systems will be a game changer in this war. I thank all the Ukrainians and the European Union for helping us in this war. And we really need to help them without being able to promote such a powerful war. But today we're talking about the technology. And that's those technology based wars is second world war days. In fact, one can follow and track this war in real time. And I'll put you in the logical back as the renewable. And I consider the war as a matter of one has two intrusive processes and rebuild the situations and systems. And I think I've tasked now considering all the support and help we're getting from the United States, European Union. And we are getting support in various fields and what things to make sure that changes are introduced in the armed forces and the administration systems. Ukraine has shown its steaks in Cyberspace. Ukraine has demonstrated its resilience in the Cyberspace. The digital state is now operational fully. Social payments, pensions, state institutions fully economy is fully a functional and digital state. We are developing, we continue developing in a revolutionary way in this case. And therefore I'd like to use the opportunity to thank our partners again for all the help in introducing new technologies. Thank you very much, Mr. Minister. Let me ask you, Senator Portman, your impressions having traveled out of Ukraine four times since the wars began. Your sense of the role of technology, your sense of what's happening on the battlefield more broadly. There is no substitute for the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian forces. They're amazing. And I've been to the line of contact before this latest invasion, but after the initial invasion, after Crimea and parts of the Dombas were taken. And having met the troops and seen what they're made of, it didn't surprise me that you have done something that everyone thought was impossible. Which is to withstand the onslaught of the world's third-fourth largest army and done so in such effective ways. People were fighting for their families and their homeland and democracy. And that cannot be supplemented by anything on the side of the courage and the heart, but it can be supplemented with technology. And I think that's why we perhaps have underplayed that role because we're so impressed by the bravery and courage. But there's also something else very interesting going on, which is sort of from you this morning. We'll never worry about from Alex. I know. And it's cutting edge technology. This makes me huge difference. Alex, let me turn to you. Let me, you were the first CEO to visit Ukraine, meeting with President Zelensky in early June. Let me ask what two separate questions, but I think interrelated. What is the personal significance to you of what's happening on the ground in Ukraine and what are the implications more broadly for the future of warfare? Well, again, my condolences. And well, you know, this started off. So we built these products. And anti-terror context. Many in Europe don't realize. But without our products, you'd probably have 40% far right because we stopped terror attacks. Within in America, we worked on the, we distributed the vaccine. Many, many other things where terror, anti-terror efforts we can't talk about, where a poundier quietly changed the course of history. Sometimes derided by people we helped. And then so this began as more of a, okay, this is a great wrong. We've been building specialized products for 15 years that have been partially used but not totally used. And of course, the we have partners that we're beginning to help and we were asked would we help? And obviously we said yes. And quite frankly, most people weren't that interested. And then so that's, it began kind of more of like the same way we got into a lot of things. Like the pandemic in America, we have a specialized product, we have a certain role. It became a different thing because when you meet with the Ukrainians, they are, and by the way, as a riff, getting to the conclusion first, just like this is a just unique culture in terms of its entrepreneurial rigor, intellect, ability to perform under pressure with dignity. By the way, I think one of the most important things we can do besides giving you this full support of the products that, you know, we've spent billions building is telling the world, and especially our European friends, you are going to need a hub for military technology that is real in a culture that can really produce a tech scene that is equal to America. Now you have in France a significant tech scene that's growing, but in reality Europe has real issues there. And here you have a culture that is able to perform at a level of any of the world players we've ever dealt with that is poised to become a real player in technology. And certainly if I had to bet the leader of military technology in Europe, one of the things that we've seen is you productize on the battlefield and they just know a lot about the world class engineers now. What there's always this dialectic I used to be an academic between your personal societal and human. And seeing David, Sly, Goliath is just an incredibly and power important thing, not just for the Ukraine. We always talk about why the Ukrainians cause this important for the West. This is an example where the West has shown it can win against all odds. Quite frankly, it's been a long time since we've had something like that. But again, and then when you, you know, I've been talking to you for, you know, I don't know, almost a year, and every time you just see the grit, the tenacious nature, the seriousness. And by the way, the way the leadership happens, which is crazily important, they do lead from the top. The leaders at the top are on the front lines. Honestly, it is a very much of a hybrid of what you would find in American tech and in Israel. And so I think what, you know, it's inspiring to be involved in it. And what I'd like, obviously, I hope we can continue to support at a even higher level. But I think one of the most important thing we can do now is also outside of Ukraine, tell the narrative of these. This is a very special culture. Don't just invest in it because you want to do the right thing. I'm on favor of that. But invest because you might also be involved in the next great company like Poundier.
