[Music] Please welcome Chief Technology and 
Product Officer at Lumen, Dave Ward. [Music] Hey everyone, I am the last speaker before launch 
and my name is Dave Ward and as you just heard I'm the chief technology and product officer 
at Lumen. Um what that means after we've seen peaked through the keyhole of so many industries 
is that I'm going to show you uh what's going on in the world of telecommunications uh lumin as a 
service provider and I admit I'm a bit flinger I uh I think about passing packets and photons 
there has to be somebody that does that. So so that's me. So, Lumen, we call ourselves and refer 
to ourselves as the trusted network for AI. And what's really fascinating for me thinking about 
the connectivity portion of what we heard this morning for an AI strategy, you obviously need 
to choose an AR partner. We're at a palenture conference. We have something in common. Um, mo 
almost all the use cases were getting access to lock data and understanding the relationships 
of that data. So for an AI strategy, you need uh to choose an AI partner, you need to have a 
cloud strategy, but frequently what's not talked about at all is that connectivity and moving that 
data to feed the platform, to feed the LLMs. And on average, what we're seeing from our enterprise 
customers is on the order of 36 different data sources. Our company's no different. Your 
company's probably uh very similar. The data is locked on prem. The data is in data centers. 
The data is in hyperscalers. The data is in SAS platforms. To get to unlock that data, you have 
to be able to connect it all together. And so the transformation going on in the service provider 
world is around of course this AI revolution. Many things that um perhaps you've been reading in 
the in the industry are around the growth of data centers and the gigawatt data centers that are 
being built as was said earlier today for an AI for AI infrastructure you have to have the power 
infrastructure you have to have the water the real estate and also you have to have the connectivity 
infrastructure so to put it into perspective there we have about 240 million square feet of data 
centers in the US today By the end of 2028, we're going to have about a billion square feet 
of data center space. And so just the fundamental amount of money going into AI and going to these 
data centers leads me to to describe one of our one of our first businesses, which is backbone 
business. Uh Lumen um has the largest amount of conduit, the largest amount of fiber in the lower 
48. And we recently announced $8.5 uh billion dollars of new contracts with hyperscalers and 
data centers to interconnect the new AI regions. And so we're focusing a lot of our business on 
building that backbone for for for AI. Also, we are an enterprise services company. And so as 
I've heard so many of the talks today, it's and and what I'm going to show in my presentation in 
the examples, the fundamental question is how can enterprises join the AI economy? How can they get 
access to that data? How can they rebuild the comm the telecommunication services that are necessary 
to transform their own companies to to be relevant and to take advantage of the AI economy? So we 
build metro fiber, inner city fiber, connection to data centers, connection to the hyperscalers. 
We're the uh largest by means of traffic internet service provider in America and the world in fact 
and so bigger and better internet. But there's a couple things just talking about history and 
the transformation. Took about 30 years to get from some of the early concepts of the internet 
to widely deployed about 25 years ago. It took about 15 years to get to cloud 1.0. And that's 
the cloud economy that we know today. But what I just mentioned is that with basically four times 
the amount of AI data centers being built in the next three years, it's a fundamentally different 
transformation speed that has to happen for all of us in this room and certainly for me in our 
company. So cloud scale and what I mean by scale to to really simplify this it takes over a 100 
gig link about a day to move a pabyte. Okay, puts it in perspective. So therefore a lot 
feeding the data for LLMs is frequently talked about in exabytes. That's a thousand pabytes. 
Unacceptable to use that level of speed. So, we're building a new network as I just mentioned 
and really bringing in new on-ramps to the cloud, new on-ramps to data centers and moving from 100 
gig to 400 gig to 800 gig to 1.6 terab as a basic connectivity directly to enterprises and of course 
um as new on-ramps and hyperscalers and and data centers. So, that's the physical aspect of it. The 
next aspect is we're transforming the traditional tele uh telecommunications business as we've 
heard from so many companies today from being paperdriven to being a digital experience. I want 
to connect from X to Y. I want to hit a button. I want to go now or I want to use APIs to get that 
done. And so that digital layer is a fundamental transformation of the customer experience that 
we want to bring uh into the market. What you can see in this map is what I deal with every day. 
And what I mean by that is a telephone network. Many folks know they see the big windowless brick 
buildings in their metropolitan area. Telephones uh central office that was built over the last 
120 years or so of every single copper line for every telephone brought to a central location. 
Perhaps there's some wiring centers, often tens if not hundreds in each metropolitan area. How 
does the copper lines or the legacy network that was built over the last 30 years be relevant 
in the AI economy? It's really not. Um, we're highly regulated industry. We have to handle 911 
services. We're a critical infrastructure for the nation and for all of the industries here. So I 
I'm working to transform not only my industry but enable enterprises to be able to transform their c 
their companies by changing the access technology and the speed that has been the foundation of how 
companies have gotten to where they are today. So that leads me to uh my first example. We partner 
deeply with Palunteer because Lumen historically although you may not necessarily recognize the 
name you may recognize that we are an accumulation of acquisitions. You may know Centry Link, Level 
3, Quest, Savis, TWW Telecom, Wiltel etc. These all form the company that is Lumen. I've been 
there about a year and a half and brought in not only to change the network architecture but 
to change the backend architecture because as I arrived like many companies here who are created 
through acquisition nothing gets turned off all the data silos exist all the inventory systems 
exist and it's that unlocking the data and forming a relationship that really is my first example of 
how we take out our legacy equipment and take out our legacy architecture And to do that we needed 
to not only transform that network architecture but in particular transform the workflows in the 
operational environment to get that done. It was driven by paper. You know that you see the the 
people driving around in trucks and doing telecom work and things like that. Telecommunications was 
a completely ticketdriven industry. And so what what you're highlighting what I'm is highlighting 
in here in this in this uh in this demo video was what it looks like in a metropolitan area 
for a central office and then the wiring centers around it and how the connectivity 
of enterprises is connected there. And so we needed to be able to go into those inventory 
systems fully deconstruct customer line devices connected to in which wiring center and deploy 
technicians to be able to take that equipment out like and transform how that network is going 
to be built. Like a lot of enterprises here, that transformation particularly of a physical 
uh of physical assets based company like we are and so many that presented earlier than me, we 
actually have to transform the hardware. I mean, we're talking about the copper lines going down 
the poles. We're talking about the fiber in the ground. We're talking about those buildings and 
what's in them. And of course, like like everyone in a transformation, we're setting targets for how 
much cost can we take out? And for me the the cost we want to take out is of the legacy equipment and 
the legacy systems and architecture that uh is one old but two preventing enterprises and customers 
from getting into the AI economy. So to do that we partnered with Palunteer deeply understand the 
inventory of our legacy network deeply understand the workflows that our technicians have to and 
the activities they have to do to transform that piece but also using the ontology be able to 
understand which order of operations we can go through to transform our network and transform our 
business. And so it was a very very deep exercise um across all the data silos, across all of the 
workflows, across all of the acquisitions we've made to be able to pull this together. And 
so using the AI part of AIP, we were able to then have that operational optimization and be 
able to predict the cost takeout and equipment takeout that we could do over time and set our 
goals as a company for that transformation. Additionally, as you can see from from just how 
some of the data is organized, really what becomes critical for us in this journey is transform 
the architecture, transform the experience, transform how our customers are connecting 
while we're still flying the airplane. And so that is a is a really big issue when you 
have to deliver things like 911 and also all the critical data that enterprises like in this 
room uh need to run their business. And so this has been incredibly successful for us. But to 
transform our product offerings and our enterprise customers to be relevant to the AI economy, we 
had to link inventory to systems to buildings. But then also to what products have they 
been have they consumed from us? What is that era of what is that era of product? What is 
the new product that we would like to bring to market? How much money is that going to 
actually save the company by transforming? What's the revenue risk and revenue retention 
issues that we have around that? But then also are they able to use the digital experience? Are 
they getting the speeds that they need? And how are we going to deliver that? So we were able to 
dissect down into the workflow and into our fiber and into our copper the capabilities of that 
inventory as we went. And so as we as we step forward really what we're taking a look at is how 
we automate these workflows. And that's it's it's fully automated now for us to be able to dispatch 
technicians to be able to do this and to be able to have them move the customer with zero packet 
loss. But additionally, as we step forward, we can have the testing of the automation of the live 
circuit brought back into that automation flow. As we take a look at the next example, this is the 
one at how we've taken our physical inventory, matched the product inventory to customers, and 
created a migration path for our customers and for our portfolio. of how fast we can move from 
traditional things like VPNs over traditional uh dedicated private lines and T1s and these are 
some typical telecommunications products to one in which we can create that fabric that is necessary 
to access 36 different data sources and to move along that product journey. So Palunteer has been 
on both of these steps. one on understanding our network, two understanding our customers and three 
setting up our transformation journey that we can take our customers through and make sure that um 
they can take advantage of the other part of our business that backbone business which is building 
connectivity into the major AI data centers and hyperscalers. And so for for a telecommunications 
company and a service provider, the most complex thing we can do is to change is change the way it 
was always done. Telecom's been around forever. Service providers been around for a very long 
time. and changing the foundation of our revenue source into the new model that we want to work 
towards and the new model that's being demanded from the market required extreme precision, 
extreme depth into our data and the Palunteer AI platform has fundamentally helped us achieve those 
goals. So, thank you very much. [Applause] [Music]
