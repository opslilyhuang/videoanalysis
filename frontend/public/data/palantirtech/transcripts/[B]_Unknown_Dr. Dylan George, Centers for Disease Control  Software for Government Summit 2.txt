TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

So it is an absolute pleasure to be with you all today. I'm really excited to talk to you today about what we are building at the Centers of Disease Control and creating something that is referred to as the Center for Forecasting and Alpric Analytics. A lot of, we refer to our organization as CFA. So some of you may wonder why we don't have the O in our acronym. Though the first reason is CDC, if you haven't noticed, loves really long acronyms. So I told my team we're only going to have three letters. And so that was one of the reasons. The other reason is we want to make outbreaks something that goes away. We don't want outbreaks going, keeping sticking around. So we want to have used data as a superpower to take outbreaks out of the equation going forward. So if there's anything that you remember about the Center for Forecasting and Alpric Analytics, it's this thing right here. Our main mission in life is better data for better analytics for a better response. We are a response organization. We are an operational organization within the CDC to try to build an evidence base that will be better, stronger, faster to make decisions during a health crisis. That is our mission. That is what we're designed to build to accomplish going forward. So better data, better analytics for a better response. Now, one of the things I really love about what Ashram was just talking about as well, though too, is that trying to use data as a superpower, and I love the way he described it as well, trying to use data for leadership to try to drive main programs and use it as an evidence base to help us understand where we can actually use and galvanize ourselves around health objectives at a macro level. I was on a panel over the summer with Charles Chima, who was a public health officer for Sioux Falls and South Dakota. He was just an amazing guy. He was the one that said this quote right here, is data for action is the vaccines of our generation. So for some of you in the room that are not health people, vaccines are central to how we fight infectious diseases. They are one of the things that have saved more people from infectious diseases than anything else that we've been using, and we have lots of those tools now today to actually develop those. I was telling some folks over lunch, though, too. One of the things that I got terribly wrong about the pandemic was anticipating that we were not going to have a vaccine as fast as we did. I didn't think it was possible. I didn't think we were going to have it within 11 months of them hitting go. But we did. Vaccines actually saved a lot of lives over COVID. Data for action can be on that same level and on that same magnitude. If we galvanize ourselves around the right systems and how we actually use it most effectively to make things happen going forward. This is what we're dedicated to doing within the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics and to be quite honest with NCDC broadly as well. Now, who doesn't love emission statement and some major objectives? This is what we are trying to do, and this is a more formalized way of saying it's like we're trying to empower people to save lives and protect communities, and the way that we're doing that is by harnessing cutting edge analytics to generate that evidence based going forward. We have four main objectives of what we're trying to do. We're trying to improve what we were affectionately referred to as in predict, inform, innovate, and advance. We want to build a team that team tools and processes that will help us generate the analytical insights going forward. We want a team of data scientists within government that will help us actually generate the forecast and generate the analytical insights to actually know how to fight infectious disease outbreaks. The form is an objective of we need to be able to translate those results for effect. Now I used to, in a former life, I used to work at the Office of Science Technology Policy in the White House. When I was there, one of the things that I was doing there, the original reason that I went there was to help fight Ebola in 2014 and 2015 that was going on in West Africa. But something else that we were able to do is try to spec out and think about what would this new center look like. Then we were thinking about this a handful of years ago. It's like back in 2014 and 2015. We were trying to think that through. Louis Uchilini, who is the director of the National Weather Service at the time, he came and talked to me about what they were doing with tornado forecasts for modeling and whatnot. They got so good in the weather service about they could tell when a touchdown on a tornado was going to happen in time and space that they could actually, their models were really good at knowing where that was. He then self-admitted us like how they were communicating those results and warning people about when that touchdown was going to happen and when they were going to have that severe weather, they were terrible at giving those warnings. For example, they knew their models were going to actually say it's like there's going to be a touchdown in a particular community within 20 minutes and they put out warnings and those warnings made people think they had 20 minutes to go across town, get their kids, come back, be safe together, which was a natural instinct any parent would do is want to keep their kids safe. What it ended up doing is putting people on the roads at the time of touchdown. It was actually did exactly opposite of what they intended was to keep people safe. Now they obviously had to do a lot of relearning and try to trigger it, but because of those stories, because the National Weather Service was able to admit those challenges and share those examples, that's the reason why we have this objective here is to try to build the team, tools, processes so that we can actually translate analytical results to decision-makers in a much more efficient way so that they can take action in some other ways. Innovate, we need to get much better at what we're doing in terms of using data, using modeling, using visualizations, actually communicating these results in a much more effective way. So we're going to be spending R&D dollars to do this as well. I'm in advance. We want to be a world-class organization, I have a really good friend who actually runs a very similar organization in the UK government and the UK Health Security Agency for the data analytics and surveillance within the UK Health Security Agency. We've been friends for a very long time and I have an ongoing bet with him that we're going to beat him in being the best organization doing this going forward. We will see over the next handful of years who's going to come out on top. In fact, I'm going to see him on Monday and so I'm going to poke him then too. It's great. Now the UK is probably the leader in the world. Hong Kong is very good, Denmark is very good. We need to be world-class in this space as well and we are building the team to actually do this going forward. So this is our mission, vision, and how we're actually breaking up our effort going forward. Now how are we actually going to meet our mission going forward? Well, we have our minimum viable products that we're trying to work and develop right now. These are our six main kinds of efforts right here. We need capability so that we can actually address but spoke questions. So if the director of the CDC comes to us and asks us a question of how many hospitalizations could you potentially avert if you actually changed your vaccination strategies in different ways? What is the, I've got two weeks and I've got to give the president an answer, go, come up with an answer and the best you can do. I'm not actually making this up. This is something that we had to do for the director of the CDC. Come up with an answer and come up with some analysis to support this going forward. We're going to come up with the team and the tools to actually be able to do that very quickly. Also forecasting and scenario models. Forecasting is a probabilistic statement about what we anticipate over the next handful of weeks. Very similar to what you see with like weather forecasting. If you see an 80% chance of rain tomorrow, there's multiple models that are being generated to actually help us understand how to actually get that. We're going to be using very similar techniques to actually do that with outbreak data. Then also scenario models. We have to ask these questions of what if questions? What if we had a new variant that escaped, was not effective, the vaccine was not effective against? How would that impact transmission? How many people would be in the hospital because of that? What would we actually have to rejigger to actually be able to make sure that the hospital system doesn't creak under that strain? We can ask those what if questions using different sorts of scenario models to kind of think through what would be the implication and what would be the interventions that we need to put into place. We're going to be developing those kinds of scenario models going forward. In fact, we just released some preliminary scenario models for anticipating what the outlook of the next respiratory season is going to be looking like for COVID, RSV, and influenza just earlier last week, trying to anticipate what that looks like. Outbreak on Somal models. How do we actually bring models together in an ensemble so that you have multiple models, just one model, in different ways? Also we need to work on different qualitative approaches of actually presenting information in different ways. These risk assessments and technical reports are a way of actually communicating information in a systematic way going forward. We were actually able to do this effectively in a couple of contexts and we're very excited about this. Then this virtual analyst platform. Trying to bring together, within the federal government, and if you've ever worked in the government, it's like trying to allocate a computer that has enough computational power to do some heavy lifting modeling, is a multi-week process to actually get the equipment, get the appropriation, get the access to the data, get the person up and running. If you are working in a time-sensitive environment where time is actually lives, you need to be able to do that much quicker. We're actually going to have a cloud-enabled platform that will allow us to do this very quickly. We've actually had an impilot for the last 12 months or so and it's been used both for COVID because our colleagues at the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response actually is the administration for preparedness and response. So I was there when it was the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The new acronym is the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response now. Yeah, there we go. It's like, yeah, yeah. But they actually were using some of their modeling and scenario modeling on our platform. Some of our colleagues that work in STIs within CDC, another part of the CDC, they had some challenges of running some network models for M-Pox response on their computers. So they were actually able to run those on our platform as well. So we are in pilot. We are just trying to get it up and running. They were actually able to use this for response and able efforts. So we're very excited about that and so we want to get that going. So we've had a couple of successes. Two years ago we actually, we came out, this center has only been in existence for less than two years. Two years ago there was five of us. Last year there was 20 of us. Now there's about 50 of us. But these are some of the things that this small but mighty team has been able to accomplish over that last little while. Like I said, we put out risk assessments associated with M-Pox. This was an innovative way of actually putting out information in a totally different way than the CDC was used to. In fact it was the former director of CDC, Rochelle Walinsky, praised both the risk assessments and the technical reports as a way, as a prime example of how we're trying to transform CDC to actually do this on a much more broader way. So we're trying to do this on a more specific basis. Super proud and super excited about how we're actually able to do this. And then also you'll see here as well, if you type in COVID forecasting CDC, you will see figures like this. Our team generates this and it's the same sort of approaches that are being done with infectious disease or with weather forecasting. So it's like we are putting out those going forward. So you can see the probabilistic statements about what's going to be happening with hospitalization data going forward right now. And so that's been another exciting sort of effort that is going forward. This is the virtual analyst platform, like I had mentioned. We had actually been developing an on a demand computational capability so you can actually spin up various virtual machines in a cloud-enabled environment. So this allows an individual analyst to be able to spin up as many virtual machines as they need or to spin up a computationally more robust machine if they needed as well, so that they can be more effective. So it takes out that need to actually acquisition them a much more powerful laptop computer and get that going and it'll take weeks to actually get that appropriated going forward. They can spin this up in seconds. And so this is one of the things that we're really excited about putting forward in developing. The 10X value proposition of what we're trying to accomplish though is really can we actually do this and can we provide capabilities, models and processes that will help us provide this analytical support and this insight during a time of crisis. Can we do that for the federal government? That's our 10X value proposition. I am very confident we're going to be able to do that because I used to work in the federal government for a long time. I was helping in a handful of different responses and the team we're building are crazy good and I know that we can do it and we've been doing it for the last 18 months. We've been doing it for a QP data, capatitis, we've been doing it for Ebola, for Marburg, for COVID, for Mpox and now we're doing it for the fall winter respiratory season. So I'm confident we're going to be able to do this for the federal government. The 100X value proposition though is can I do this for Ashwin? Can I do this for a state and local jurisdiction? That's a much harder proposition. It's a much bigger proposition but the level of detail, the level of action that someone like Ashwin or a mayor or a governor can put into effect to actually change what's happening on the ground is immense. And so that's the target that we're trying to go for and trying to develop. Right now, the Center for Forecasting Alpric Analytics, we are building and testing some tools internally. We are generating and sharing those analyses at the state and territorial level. We want to build analytical tools and be able to share them with our federal partners but more importantly with state and local jurisdictions in robust ways. And then also we want to, depending on our level of resources that we're able to acquire, we want to be able to either provide services to state and local jurisdictions or provide analytical tools that they can use in different capacities. And so that's where we want to go and we want to actually make sure that we're trying to attain that 100X value proposition going forward. Now I do have a couple of my colleagues in the office in the room here as well that are working on that come from the Data Modernization Initiative or from other parts of CDC that are working on response. Now, there is a whole enterprise across CDC and the Center for Forecasting Alpric Analytics is a component part of what that's doing. The Data Modernization Initiative is critically important and fundamentally what the Data Modernization Initiative is, is how do we improve the analytical capabilities to move and have interoperable data move from various things like the immunization records from vital statistics, from electronic health records, from laboratories more efficiently to public health so that we can have this picture that Ashwin was talking about so that we can make that data for leadership much more effective. That is an effort of how do we actually improve the system across the board. The readiness response enterprise integration is fundamentally as HHS protect. This is a tool that is actually trying to extract from the data systems a common operating picture for an ongoing outbreak so we have situational awareness on that particular situation so that we have that, you know, gold standard of understanding of what's happening for a particular outbreak. Now, as many of you know with epidemiology, epidemiology is an observational, in a lot of ways is observational like astronomy. It's like if we do our best with data modernization, it's like trying to look at either Alpha Centauri or the Sun. The light from Alpha Centauri comes to us, you know, it takes four years for light from Alpha Centauri to come to us for us to see it. We're seeing what happened four years ago. If we see the light from the Sun, that's eight minutes ago. So if the data modernization is radically effective, we will move from Alpha Centauri to the Sun, but we're still seeing the past. And that's why it's really critically important that we have the Center for Forecasting Outbreak Analytics so we know what's coming around the corner so we can see through the windshield and not just through the rear view mirror as we're driving our car in a response. So that's why these component parts are critically important to work together so that we can actually know what's happening, what is the standard of truth, and then where are we going in an outbreak so that we can actually know how to have that response be most effective going forward. Now Ashwin talked about his Center of Population Data Sciences, which I am super excited about, want to learn more about it. I think that's really great. Now, but not to be outdone, we are definitely announcing as well. We are standing up a whole new network of people that are working on developing new methodologies, looking at new data sources, and testing all of those out with a health department in a robust way. And then lastly, trying to figure out anything that is really exciting, trying to scale that across jurisdictions. We have a network that is standing up, we're announcing it today that we have 13 selected awardees. These awardees are going to get anywhere from $3 to $6 million per year, roll that up across those, that's about $50 million a year, across five years, and so it's a nice chunk of change. But the thing that's most exciting about that though is that we're going to be building capacity at the state and local level to actually improve what we're doing going forward in using analytics to guide decision making during a response. This is a huge step forward for us in attaining our 100x value proposition. We need to work much more effectively with state and local jurisdictions. This is enabling us to do that. We need to work, we need to make sure that the data modernization initiative is successful and that HHS protect is actually successful and useful. But then also we need to work more effectively, quite honestly, with the private sector. We need to bring the private sector capabilities into our capabilities to actually do this to add effect. I am excited about that there are a handful of folks from the private sector that are component parts within this network. Now when you see this right here, you will see that there are mainly academic primary folks, but there are sub that are involved with this right here. But these are where the primary folks are located in the United States. This is our first step going forward. We are very excited about the folks that are involved in this network and we are just going to get them up and running over the next while and see how that works going forward. We are very excited about some of the capabilities that are going to be generated from there going forward. This is my last slide right here. And this is actually a friend of mine, Jeff Schaiman, who is at Columbia University. He, I have been a friend of his for a very long time, he put me on to this slide. What you see in this slide is over decades on the X-axis and you see some sort of measure of forecasting skill on the Y-axis and this is numerical weather forecasting. What it's showing is it's going from back in the 50s and 60s, we were pretty rubbish at forecasting weather. It's increased capacity through time to the point where today we all have a mobile device and we all check it to anticipate what's going to happen in the weather for the day or the next day. And we use that and we know how to use that information to make decisions in our personal lives. We have intuition about that information. It took a long time for us to get good at doing this numerical weather forecasting. Now how did we actually get so much better at it so that it's actually information that we use on a daily basis? So we spent a lot of money as a nation on data, on models, on people, on computational power and a handful of other efforts but we also sustained that effort through time to the point where we actually can actually take the maximum benefit of that going forward. Now unfortunately where we are with disease forecasting, where we are with using data to help us manage outbreak situations is still, it's not in the 50s and 60s, it's probably in the 70s and 80s but we need to get much better at where we're going and how we're actually doing this. And that is one of the reasons why I actually left the private sector. So the former director of CDC, Richel Wolinski, recruited me out of the private sector to come build this organization. And I'd been in the federal government for a long time but I'd been, I left federal service six or seven, actually eight years ago now. And I came back to build this because I think we're out of transformative moment in history right now. The need is acute and is well understood. The technologies are available. We have multiple trillion dollar companies in the United States alone that are our major companies and they are at their core are data companies. We have the technologies, we have the need and we have the leadership and we know now that we can actually make this happen going forward not only for numerical weather forecasting but for actually making this true for helping us keep safe in an ongoing outbreak. So I left the private sector because I knew that I could be a part of actually making this the same sort of graph for infectious disease forecasting for providing better evidence base going forward. And this is why I'm here today and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to talk to you about this effort and for the enduring kind of relationship that we've had with Palantir because they've been absolutely wonderful in helping us build some of these capabilities going forward. And so with that I will stop and see if you have any questions. Thank you. I'm Katarina. I'm a fellow at Asper. Can you see administration for the first strategic preparedness and response? Can you speak to what it's like to design a whole center that's flexible to model different diseases? I think you said Marburg and Hebsy and what it looks like to cater to all of those different needs. Yeah. I think it's really great about working at CDC. There's a lot of great subject matter experts across all of those pathogens and there's really good modeling that has been done in a range of those programs. For example, in influenza, they've been doing influenza forecasting for the last 10 years. They've been leading the way on doing this going forward. And so there's some really interesting sort of analytical capabilities that are already within CDC. And so we're not starting from ground zero. We're starting from on the shoulders of giants in some of the other programs. Now in some of the other places, like RSV, there's just not very good models for RSV. And so it depends, it's a little bit pathogen specific on how good the data systems are and how good the models are. For influenza, there's really good data. There's pretty good models for COVID. There's really good data. Well, there has been really good data. There's been really good models. RSV, there's not as great a data. There's not as great a model. And that's true across all other pathogens. So we have to figure out, it's like, well, come up with a rack and stack of what do we anticipate is going to be the most concerning pathogens focused on those first and then build out from there. And so, you know, respiratory is the pathway that's going to probably cause the most acute societal disruption in a pandemic versus something like tuberculosis or HIV. So that's why I think that's the place where we're going to start and then build out from there. Hi, my name's Ethan. I work for Biobot Analytics. You had mentioned one of the necessary ingredients for success was sustained funding. And public health has historically been underfunded. Typically, during times of crisis, you see funding flow in and then it dries up. Some people refer to this as the panic and neglect cycle. I'm wondering, you know, how do we, in your opinion, how do we shift this paradigm so that we have consistent, reliable funding for public health the way we treat something like national security? I know it's somewhat political, but I'm just curious based on your experience working in government. You know, how do you think we move this conversation forward? You would think COVID would have taught us the lesson that this is something we need to fund consistently and reliably, but I'm afraid we might not have learned those lessons. Yeah, thanks for the question. I think the two biggest mistakes I made during the pandemic is one. I thought that we weren't going to be able to get a vaccine in a short amount of time as we did. I was so grateful that I was wrong on that one. The second major kind of like missed up that or mistake that I made with the pandemic was thinking that this, that we wouldn't go back into it in the neglect cycle as fast as we did. As, you know, we do seem to want to go into this collective amnesia on what had happened in this kind of like, in this kind of traumatic event. And so I was, there was a significant amount of dismay that that was, that I was wrong on that as well. You know, I think it's really challenging. I mean, we're not, when prior to COVID, you know, bio preparedness really had a bipartisan kind of consensus that it was a really important issue. And it did have the fluctuations on funding going forward and that sort of thing. But people generally speaking were supportive of trying to figure out how to improve health issues broadly. And it was more of a question of it's like, how, which issue do we need to kind of focus on going forward? We're in a very different environment now. And it's like, I don't have a good answer to the question. But it is definitely something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. And then one of the main jobs though too, and trying to build out this center that was trying to convince and make sure that appropriators understand the value of what we're trying to build because it is, I honestly believe it will be critically important to use data for action to keep American safe going forward. And even if we're wildly successful in the next pandemic to actually generate vaccines in as short amount of time as we want, or if we're as successful in doing it in a hundred day because there's an objective to try to do that right now, still a hundred days. And that's a hundred days from when we start to go. So you're talking somewhere, anywhere from three to six months where we're not going to be protected and data is going to be the biggest thing that's going to help us keep safe. And so we need to be able to convince people that data is the best way to keep people safe in those times where we don't have those medical countermeasures that will do the trick. Yeah. Awesome. 30 seconds left. I will just hand it over to Nusia. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time. Yep.
