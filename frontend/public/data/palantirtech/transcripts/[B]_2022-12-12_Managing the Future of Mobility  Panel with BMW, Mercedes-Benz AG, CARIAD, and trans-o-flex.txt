TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Great, hello, welcome everybody to the automotive panel where we'll be discussing complexity and supply chain disruptions here today. As we get started, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Liam Moore and the global head of automotive mobility at Palantir and I'm thrilled to be joined today with a really impressive collection of automotive executives to discuss what are pretty pressing topics in the industry. So maybe very briefly for background for those that don't know, Palantir automotive mobility is one of our fastest growing domains at Palantir. Making it very concrete, we actually work now with you know most of the top 10 auto-early M's. You've seen representation here today on the stage. We work with dealers, we work with rentals, we work with Ferrari, we work with logistics companies such as Transaflex that Christophe Shulla will be representing data vendors and brokers in the industry and so on. And one of the reasons where we're seeing this explosion in demand is that you know can of as Alexander mentioned today this morning the industry is going through some seismic changes and they're looking to software and technology to see how can we actually manage that complexity in a first or a way. And topics that you know we all know such as electrification, they focus on the customer, you know, these supply chain crises and how we can actually manage that together with software. So just so everyone's got an idea of the format, we'll start with some introductions, we'll then open up the panel and then we'll have plenty of time for Q&A, so about 15, 20 minutes. So hold your questions and hopefully we can make this interactive towards the end. So I think without further ado we can we can probably get started with the introductions. So, you know, from Closure, Carrier, daughter of Foxone Group, actually I just ended up on the job by chance because I'm a sales guy and the guy who did that before said we need a guy who understands sales because it's a lot about customer data and customer experience and data driven development. So I cannot build a tool but I could tell the people what the tool have to do. So on that, so I mean, so I started as a sales director in the Foxone Group for SEAT, then I moved to Foxone Financial Services and did five years of international fleet, so fleet management and by the way that's very important, usually don't know how it's on the other VMs, but we tend to forget our biggest customer group, the commercial customers, we always try to do fancy things with the private customers. So on then I was managing director of Foxone Leasing, so I'm into financial a little bit and then I moved two years ago to to carry it. Carry it is known for the car platforms, the ID family, the one-to-one platform, the premium platform, one or two and the two dot, oh it's called in, that's the autonomous driving platform. And all the things that goes across those car platforms, that's in the X5, that's my error, that's mean if you sell a five year old combustion engine or an electric vehicle you need an e-commerce platform, that's done by us, the CRM platform for example, all the apps, the connections and down to the physical touch points, we all talk about digital touch points, but we still have also one one important physical touch point, that's our retailers, our dealers outside, so all that brings together, it's the bridge between customers and sales and technique also bring things in the car out of the car, so that is my area, and so of course it's important, and we started with with Palantir and comes to of course after sales things, prediction things, classical things we saw also on the, on the tables, that's really important because especially when we talk about commercial customers, it's really important to avoid breakdowns on their side because they earn money with the cars and that's what we try to do and of course optimize then also the loyalty with our customers because that's getting more and more important, you know we have the shift to electric vehicle, that means we have less sales and revenues, specials and after-years, it comes to all the parts and so on, so we need to find a way really to have it on one hand, the details see the direct sales, but also the loyalty to really keep them into our ecosystem, that's my job. Great, I think we've got a lot to dive into there in just a moment, so maybe just finishing off some introductions Thomas from Mercedes if you'd like to go next. Good afternoon, my name is Thomas, Thomas Genshel, I'm actually following the introduction of Alex this morning, I'm actually part of the second market leader in premium cars, must he dispense? I'm actually an operations guy, long history in operations producing vehicles, managing supply chains, then going to sales and right now the next complexity and after sales, managing the supply chain there worldwide with more than 50 locations worldwide, 6000 dealers, 800,000 part numbers which we need to deliver to our customers worldwide. And this is actually one of the major challenges we see right now, managing those stock levels, managing the supply network all over the world on an effective and customer-centric way for the future. And talent here is supporting us in this area to meet our automation prediction goals in the future, but openly we are the new kit of no block, I think here, I saw all those experiences this morning and we just started with talent here, 26 months ago, dived into that journey and feeling quite happy on that, doing the first pilots, seeing really the gain, the value we can create and the big challenge for us is now to get the next stage to really differentiate those use cases, getting out of the fragmentation of the different use cases and bringing that to a conclusive value generation all over the place and at least after sales where we are working on and then diving and deriving that to the whole company at the end. Great, thank you, John. And maybe slightly different flavor also, with mobility with logistics, Christoph, maybe if you could, My name is Chris of Schurler. I'm owner and chairman of the logistic company in Germany, so I'm not a manufacturer, I'm not automotive, but I'm at least client from you. So we are probably even the more young kid on the block, we are with Palantir, thanks to Bern, since three months, but we have made unbelievable good experience already until now. So we are the market leader in pharmaceutical logistics in Germany and Dach reaching and you wouldn't think that's complex, it's super complex because we have sort of a virtual network, which we are recalculating overnight every night again. We can react within 80 minutes to recalculate the whole network again. So if a depot breaks down or a conveyor belt brings down, our customers don't feel it. Now, we are in a sector where quality, as you said, matters and for us quality in a health sector, we also deliver into the hospitals, we deliver into the surgery rooms. So we have to make absolutely sure it works. We are above a 99% quality level and we calculate quality harder than other other logistic companies because we start where our customer sort of brings us or where we pick up the password. So we take also the mistakes of our customers into a car. So if he sends us something with the wrong label, we counted as our mistake because we want to make sure it doesn't have, it doesn't matter later that we blame his logistic guy that somebody had a problem in a hospital. So our organization, even it is much smaller than your organizations, from a, let's see, optimization point of view is at a point where we with human help, we can't go better. So we have now started with, with Palantir. We have made good experience because let's say the data lake, which you're all familiar, I'm an engineer, some other IT guy, the data lake is great. We can take immediate advantage of this. I give you a little example, very little. It's not an optimization. It's custom experience we do. We have, we're delivering the, the pharmaceutical newspaper every two weeks in whole Germany. That means we have to be in 30 minutes in 24,000 locations at the same time in Germany. Why? Because there are millions of Germans waiting in front and they want to have this newspaper to know the rest. And if the pharmacy doesn't have it, they go to the other one. And then he probably lost his client. So this is a very emotional issue. And even it's just a newspaper. We have now built for our customer a heat map together with you and we're very proud it took just 10 days. And he has an ice cream in front of him, the logistic head, where he sees in colors, sort of coming from, from the light red to red, within this half hour every, every two weeks, he sees, whereas newspapers are distributed where no hole is, so it's very happy. So this gives customer attention. We could have never done before. So we are very excited to see what we do. Of course, the optimization we can do our vast and for us, we are, how do you say, numbers met us. So if we increase one of our KPAs a little bit, it goes down to the P and L immediately. So that's why we are in. I think we are the first small middle shunt company you have as a client, but we are very happy. Great. Thank you, Christoph. So I'm going to kind of move into, I guess, how we've already started, but how your companies and yourselves are looking to define that future of mobility and some of the challenges that are in there. Maybe Thomas, I'll start with you. Mercedes have a new luxury strategy out and interested to hear you say, you know, as the operations guy, first of all, kind of what's the direction that you guys are taking luxury in the industry? And then as the operations guy, how's that translating to your world and after sales and some of the challenges that are associated with that? Yeah, with this strategy update of economics of desire, this may be outlined our future of messy dispense as a dedicated pure play luxury company. So we want to differentiate there as well. And that is also setting the goal for our us and our customer experiences. So at every touch point, every single stage of the customer journey needs to be reflecting this requirement. Yeah, it needs to truly reflect the outstanding experience, emotions of a true luxury company. And that doesn't stop in sales. It needs to go as the whole way to after sales as well. Yeah, for us, we translated that in global services and parts as services noble, as we define service for all customer experiences around the car, from operations to logistics, parts, warranty, technical service, and so forth. And noble can be interpreted in a lot of different ways. On the one hand side, we want to really reach this outstanding experience for our customers. We want to buy our services we provide by our touchpoints in our customer centers, in our workshops. And at the end, noble is as well as service anyway, is fulfilling the sustainability vision we have. As long as we bring the cars and the products on the street and keep them on the street as long as possible. So therefore that approach is noble, a noble deep per se at the end. So this luxury strategy is describing our way towards our customer, our customer experience, and how we want to bring it like that. Great. A customer experience seems to be a common thing that you've used there. Maybe I'll bring you into this because that was kind of part of your introduction. I guess with your role, how are you thinking about the future of that customer experience? And again, what are some of the challenges of managing regulatory might be part of that for actually bringing in that customer journey together? I think the future thing is we heard about it this morning that the future of the car will kind of be in just electronic device. And you use that know that from your mobile device. And there are think many things that you can do in the car and that the things that only can be done together with the car and data you need. For example, if you go home, usually you go 30 minutes ride and you want to watch a movie, a five-year series goes 45 minutes, we're able to do them and ask the customer share with slow down a little bit, go 45 instead of 30 minutes, things like that. When they come to automotive health, for example, we all know the variables here, a lot sugar and so on. The force there will be a lot of sensors in the car. Always, of course, we have the consen of the customer. He's in the end, the one who decides. But if he wants to, some of them just don't want, but the other thing is cool is convenient. We could do really some predicting, also in regards to health, things like that. So and but that's not enough. I think you need this seamless journey that comes to work. For example, getting a call out of the car with your mobile or bring it with a mobile into the car, things like that. And again, also, thanks for commercial customers. If you're working in a field force, actually, each and every five and ten minutes you look on your mobile phone. Do I have the next call? What's the next appointment about? And so you could mirror that already today into the HMI on the screen. So we don't have to wait for the normal striving. We can do step by step already. Good experience today already. If it comes to work or health, and that is what we, what we aim for so that we really step by step grow together with our customers. And for that, we need to know how he uses the services. Does he use the service or doesn't use the service because he could not find it? Or it's no worth it. And that is the data what we need. And with that data, we're going to really develop the next or the best next services for our customers. And sure, that can kind of interested in your opinion here. So from the world of kind of logistics, you know, you mentioned having this customer centric viewpoint from there. I guess the first question is, how are you wondering how that direction is going to be more customer centric in yours? And is there any kind of overlap, I guess, with what the guys have said in that, but now also world? Well, well, our product is security, safety, trust, you know, which, which is represented, we have to be on time, correct product, correct person and correct conditions, how we deliver this. So there we are already at 98, 99% to maintain this and to give our customers the feeling that this is more secure and that they can rely on it and that we can integrate with them and that we can show them what's going on. And by the way, that we can optimize ourselves to, to, let's say, increase the margin and reduce the cost on behalf of our customer. This is where we do need very powerful IT. We do have a powerful IT ourselves, but this was homemade and then we have, of course, SAP, which work is nice, but we have all these different silos. And that's what what Foundry or Palantir is giving us. This is sort of the data lake, which enables us to do optimizing everything. And you can imagine we're doing about 3000 different tours a day with 50, 50,000 drop points and we are recalculating this every day. So a program like Palantir is actually an answer. So when I met a burnt first time, I told him about this. He says, well, we have your solution and whatever you wish we can do.
