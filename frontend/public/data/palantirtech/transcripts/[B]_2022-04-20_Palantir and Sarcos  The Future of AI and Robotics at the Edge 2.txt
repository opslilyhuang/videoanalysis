My name is Kiva Algood and I am the president and CEO of Sarcos. The mission in vision for Sarcos is simple. We are here to prevent injury and save lives. What makes the Sarcos and Palantir relationship so unique is the fact that we are really pushing that technology curve. It is the advancement that we are making in AI, machine learning and cloud compute. It is their tool set that allows us to be able to run those models and really understand what is happening with the robot real time. Sarcos has two different platforms. We have a called XT, upper extremity robotic platform that is very anthropomorphic in terms of motion and thexterity to seem onto human. Then we have access skeleton, which is a full body, access skeleton powered. So you can imagine if you use access skeleton, you can lift 150, 200 pounds and feel like you are lifting 10, 15 pounds. The Guardian XT is the upper extremity robot with two arms and torso. The two arms are anthropomorphic to human arms and can be operated in teleoperation mode or from the ground or from distance. Traditionally robotics is associated with a factory line in which they cannot repeat the same task over and over, but that is only one task. In our case, we can actually do all those tasks with a single rubber without necessary reprogramming. Right now, the core focus is helping Sarcos on their road to commercialization. Using Apollo, Sarcos can manage their fleet of robots at scale to be able to deploy software and updates across their fleet within moments. The second thing is foundry edge and potentially enabling Sarcos to not only collect the data off the robots, but do it in a way that is cost effective such that not everything has to be sent to the cloud, potentially saving them terabytes of information that is probably low signal and eventually getting the right information to the right analyst or operator. Last one is aware pounds here potentially can serve as their infrastructure to deploy artificial intelligence on the robots and to be able to allow or enable their engineers to iterate quickly on the algorithms that really make the Sarcos robots unique. Foundry can contribute to many levels in Sarcos, anything that interfaces with the cloud or passes data to Foundry has a potential to be used as a tool to analyze the data to project a time series to understand what's happening in the robot over time. And ideally, we would like to use in kind of forensic mode, which means collect the data of pass data to Foundry and then do the forensic analysis to figure out what went wrong, something like microservices we haven't been aware before, but that has a huge potential to allow us to update software firmware remotely, which is a big capability because we don't need to send the technicians who don't feel to do updates. Computing of the edges is another component of this, because we can actually have the model stored in the Foundry and then push back into the edge devices with a big capability to adapt to new situation, new tasks. It doesn't require connectivity. Core capabilities from Foundry, like branching, versioning, provenance, are essentially helping accelerate the product roadmap development and helping their engineers to iterate on the algorithms that are eventually going to be deployed on the robots in the field. We want to help support Sarcos to launch their robot as a service across various industries and to as many customers as possible, not only from the product development side helping their product teams to deliver against their product roadmap faster, but also for the business and the business development side. We'll be able to take their compute capability and our robotic capability and really deliver a unique solution every single time we come to a different place. Whether it's a satellite or whether it's a submarine or whether it's a robot, we want to help companies like Sarcos on their road to building semi-autonomous or autonomous technology because that's the future of industry 4.0.
