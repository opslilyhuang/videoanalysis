TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Like re-entering the videos. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think you can jump right into like a game of the purpose of this to talk about why you dropped out and remember that. Yeah. Fin again. Alex, how's it going? I'm good, how are you? Doing well. Okay. Tell the people who you are. So I'm Fin again, I'm from St. Paul. I delta on hospitals in the New York office and I was formerly at Columbia University. Wow, formerly? Yes, formerly. Okay, well I guess the million dollar question is, you know, why formerly? Why did you decide to drop out and join Palantir? I mean, that's a good question. There's like a couple of reasons because it's obviously like a big decision. But it's funny, one of my interviewers when I was interviewing for the internship actually asked me who said like, why are you, do you want to be an intern instead of just dropping out of college and working here full time? I didn't have a really good answer to that. Like there were some classes I wanted to take that seemed interesting, but like, really for me, what was my motivation for leaving is just that I want to be able to make impact. I was tired of being in school and doing stuff that kind of didn't seem to matter that much. It's like maybe interesting and maybe fun to do, but it doesn't really improve anyone's lives. We're in hospitals, it's like some of the stuff I built as an intern is sending people back home to their families instead of being in a hospital bed. It's like improving patient care and I found that it was really rewarding, really. Like that, I think, really just kind of sealed it for me. I think I couldn't go back to writing short answers, responses to assigned reading. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I totally get you. And I mean, in making that decision, I'm sure you know, as hard as you go from being a student, you know, everyone else is a student and all of a sudden, oh yeah guys, by the way, goodbye, you know, dropping out. How was that? Were you able to go through those conversations with your friends easily or your family easily? How was that whole process? I heard mixed things for my friends, so some of them thought it was a really great idea, some of them thought, I might be ruining my life. I'm crazy. Yeah, yeah. But I don't know, I just felt like, you know, I really knew I wanted to do it. So yeah. Alright, see ya. Everyone wants to know the answer? It's a million dollar question. Why did you drop out? I think, you know, there was like a lot of considerations about like, okay, like, if I, you know, now I'm not going to have a degree, like, where does that leave me? Yeah. And then on the other hand of like, oh, I'm going to have, like, I'm going to be a pound-teer, so like, who cares? And was a little bit of the mentality. And yeah, obviously, like, you consider like, hey, like, down the line, like, what's the effects of not having a degree? And I think a lot of people work towards the degrees so they can get here, and so if you're already here, you know, like, what do you need to degree for? Yeah. Unless for like, you know, somewhere later down the line, and even like, later down the line, I think like places that might have, like, that would ignore, like, oh, your app pound here, but, oh, like, you don't have a degree. So like, we won't even, whatever are not places that I would even want to be at the end of the day. I think like, being part of like the culture where everything's like, merit-based, like, what have you done? Which is, which is here. Like, that's kind of where, where I want to be, as opposed to like, hey, you have a degree or not. Okay, no, get out. So I think that was like one of my main considerations is like, at the end of the day, like, being here, app-hound, here opens like way more doors than it could ever close, by not having to. Yeah, totally agree. And why do you, why do you think like, now specifically, what's the time? You know, if you'd intern maybe four years ago or whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, why, why not? What's so special about being a palancier today? Yeah. So I think what's so special about palancier and like, palancier today, it just how quickly everything moves, like a lot of people think, like, oh, just go finish your degrees, see if you could come back in a year or something like that. But time here is just not real. You know, like, one year here is 10 years anywhere else. The growth in a year is going to be like magnanimous, you know? Like, you shouldn't miss out on that. And I thought like, like, at the end of the day, like, I want to be here, like, at the start of this era before, you know, before closes and a new one opens. And so I thought it was, it was reasonable, like, hey, like, now's the time, like, get in it and be here. I feel like I should drop out too. Yeah, you should. Even though I already did. Spears my year off. In magnanimous is a big word, man. I like it, I like it. Would you, would you have to say to your parents, were they all in poor? Like, what are you doing to them? Like, what was your parents? Mom and dad, we're both on board. Wow. That's a big carp guy. And big doctor, carp guy. Yeah. On that point, sort of, you know, are you also a big carp guy? You know, what's your favorite interaction that you've had with carp there at your time? Yeah, so it's funny. So I've interacted with carp a few times. The first time, though, was on my onboarding. It was my like, second day. He was in the DC office. Yeah. I don't know. He was, you know, he was carpin' around. And she... Wait, what is carpin' around me? No, you watch him. He walks around. He's, you know, he's carpin' around. All right. Yeah. Yeah, I feel like it's really unique, you know, you just walk around. Yeah. The CEO's right there. Yeah. I think that's also like, also like, parathigmatic of like the pound-tier culture where like, the CEO of the company is just like walking around and like talking to people and saying like, yeah, like, what are you up to? Or like, oh, like, what are you doing? And like, actually like, critiquing you on some of the things that like, when you give answers, like, I don't know where, like, when I was telling people, like, they're like, they don't really believe me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, me to see it like, I'm like, yeah, I don't know who's... Yeah, no, I hear the same. I was once telling my friends, like, yeah, you know, I saw the CEO last week and they're like, oh, you saw him like, and he was in a meeting room with someone, like, no, like, we were walking along and I was eating Oreos and he told me, why are you poisoning your body? And I was like, all right, you know, like, thanks, Dr. Cart, we're not glad to be here too, you know. Why did you drop out of college? And where did you go to college? Yeah, sure. It's a good question. I went to Johns Hopkins. I come from like a family of immigrants and so the primary narrative is always like one of safety, one of like, aligning with social conventions. And so it's very, very hard to like, really break that narrative and do something as like, extreme as not getting a degree. But I think, you know, ultimately, something that's like, articulated a lot here is like, you know, are you the type of person that like wants to work in a space that is like so rigid that they're like an overfit to these requirements? Or like, do you want to work in a company that's like going to be understanding of you as like an intrinsically valuable person and one that can like, brings goes to the table outside of this like piece of paper. And also I think that like, pound here itself is just like a really, really cool company that has like a really good reputation. And so in many ways, I think that like also works as a certain, you know, that's sort of pound here degree. Wow. An eloquent man. Very interesting. But it's really one of that point though. You said, you know, you're from a family of immigrants and stuff like that. How did this go with your parents? You know, they did it both well, they did it both well. How was that conversation? I think they were like, definitely wasn't like, you know, there was definitely many conversations. But I think ultimately like, they were pretty on board. I think they like realized that the semester like, how excited I was about the work that I was doing, how valuable. Like, I thought that that work was. And I think like, they could just tell like I was learning so much working here. And I think like, ultimately those variables were like compelling to them as, you know, as well as they were to me. Wow. I mean, since I mean, you talk a lot about the, you know, how compelling the work was like that. What was the actual work? Like, what'd you do during your internship where you're like, wow, I just love this so much. I think actually like, the sort of way that I started my internship is a really good, like microcosm to like describe the palantir internship process. Yeah. So I arrived on like my first day. And the team was like, you know, you get your computer, you get all set up. And my team is like, you know, we have this group of providers in a hospital and like observation and inpatient units. That we haven't been able to make a ton of progress with like go on site tonight and you know, be there for two days and like figure out what, you know, the problems are what we could possibly help them with. And so like on my first night here, I just like went to the hospital by myself and like was around there for two days. And it was like really a really awesome like deep and experienced. I think I got on word right quickly. What was one of the most like really stressful times when it like ended up being like the best thing in the world where you know, you had a lot of work for one week or you were sprinting for a few days, but then the result was just like, wow. Yeah, I think I think our our second onsite, we were essentially like sprinting on one of our workflows and we were just like literally like in the lobby to like 2 a.m. And like the conclusion to the night was like, oh, like this is like we're not like we're toast. Like I'm out and that's a lot of nights on the inside and like, all right, we got to sleep and like we'll like deal with this tomorrow. Nobody actually had her sleep. But then like that was like the first night on the on site, but like by the third night of the on site, like we had like brought the the you know, the thing that we built for them to like such a meaningful, meaningful point that like in the meeting where we were demoing it, we actually like tripled their, like like their metrics for like it was selecting patients for a hospital as home. And so like in the meeting, we select like we found like 15 eligible patients, which like usually takes them like a month and like demoing and it wasn't even done. And like they were all just kind of blown away by it. It was really really cool. Yeah, no, super, super sick. A home orchestra, I'm in there like you know, your day to day here. What does it look like? Right. I think one of the biggest differences is just how much more open ended everything here. Everything is here. Everything is really oriented around trying to get it some end result. And you don't know, you know, how you're going to do it until you're, you know, most of the way through the process and you have the problem figured out. Whereas even you know, building a, you know, maybe building something for a project in school, there's still like a relatively like clear cut set of things you're going to implement. Whereas when I like approach a new project at Palantir, I have no idea even what the problem is I'm solving, what the technical solution to that is going to be. And so there's this I think really interesting process of just learning all about what the problem is before you even think about the solution that's I think very rewarding. Totally. I think it's like super interesting and different compared to school because you know school it's like this is the problem to find the super clearly. And then it's like, Oh, you just you know, you're solving it's our part where here it's like to find the problem in itself is like the hardest problem you can even think of. So you're at Hopkins and came to Palantir, you know, and the work you're doing here is obviously like different from Hopkins, but how does it actually compare? You know, if you would have been there for an extra year doing work there. Something I learned like really quickly in my experience of Palantir is just how large the gap is between solving these sort of like rigid and theoretical problems. Versus actually creating operational value. I think that in university the sort of like paradigm that you're used to is one where you're given these very well scopes, very theoretical problems. Sometimes they're very complex, but really what solving it looks like is just like following these sort of requirements and just like getting something done. And I think that my experience at Palantir is shown that like real world problems are not like that at all. And where the real difficulty lies is actually in getting in the weeds, being able to really create something that's operationally valuable is exceptionally difficult. And I think that's where like the real work lies and that's where like the real excitement lies. And I think people think that when they think about like the sort of cutting edge of technology, they imagine all these like really theoretically these sort of theoretical developments. But the way I experience is that like that's the cutting edge where the cutting edge is taking these sort of like really interesting theoretical ideas, these really interesting technologies and actually creating operational value with them. And I think like at Palantir we're really like pushing that edge and like expanding it to all these like new areas. Yeah, and I totally agree I think people have this idea that oh we can do AF for everything. We can do all these crazy cool stuff but we walk into the hospital and we're using sticky notes out here. So very different and very interesting to see for sure. You've been asking me a lot of questions but you know like what did you drop out you know you made the same decision that we all did like you know I'd love to hear your reasoning. This is crazy. Flip in the script on me. I think I dropped out for similar reasons as you and C.O. and and fit again. I think what I was doing in school was it was important but by no means like am I saying it wasn't important. It was definitely important for me to learn but I think it was just that. It was just me learning how to you know code how to like problem solve but actually applying that and doing anything in the real world. It's like I had none of that in school. So I think at Palantir you know I came in and I had learned some things in class you know how to write some functions whatever stuff like that. But when I actually came here I learned so much more how to actually apply that in the real world. So I think that impact for me was just something I could not pass up. And the second biggest thing for me was the people I like loved. I love you. I love you through it and I love to also like my friends in college but what I did also expect was to really like just love talking with all the people here at the company. I think it's like really unique where I walk around and anyone who you talk to is just like the most interesting person you've ever met. It's like I'm a meeting you and you're telling me you did two gap years you know you went to Israel you did all these cool things and I was like wow and then out the next day I would you know talk to you know see on it he told me you know. What way last cool for sure for sure but I don't know I was just super interesting to hear all these like different perspectives and everyone's just so nice to talk to you. And it's like you really really feel it's like a home away from home for me it's probably closer to my home but you know I really love the people part of it as well.
