TRANSCRIPT

Hi Patrick how are you? I'm good. Do you want to introduce yourself? I'm a back-end dev on Foundry. I have intern here in 2023 and then I came back full-time. Nice. If we take you back to that first internship that you did for a joining full-time, what actually made you want to apply to an internship at Palincer in the first place? I think the things that stood out for me about Palincer is that it seemed like a place with like a really high technical bar where there's a lot of like exceptional people who are going to help me grow and deliver like quite technical projects and another part of it was I saw a lot of the work we do with like NHS, the vaccine delivery, the work with Ukraine, which inspired me and seen like this place is doing like this company is doing cool things things that are helping people and I want to be part of that. When I self-huntering in action I could like see like oh I really want to use that. Like that would be great at this previous internship. So it kind of motivated me towards seeing what the product actually does and gets into no more about Palincer. And then when you actually join so when you got the offer to join as an intern, when you got here was anything unexpected? Like does anything surprise you at all? Yeah yeah. Now that I think about it I so as an intern I expected to be handheld for like most parts of the internship but I was surprised at the level of autonomy and trust that I was given by my team, my mentor, my lead. They all encouraged me to think about solutions to problems independently. I didn't feel like an intern at all. Nice okay what's he felt more like a full-time employee? It felt like I've been working at the company for some years already. You mentioned that you did some internships at other like big tech companies before doing an internship at Palincer. Like how did they compare? Was there any like key or crucial differences? I think even now my conviction is quite strong about it than the other big tech companies that I interned with had a very explicit hierarchy or hierarchical structure. Like my work was quite small. I had this feeling that my work could have been compressed into two weeks instead of three months and I did not like that feeling at the end. So I interned at a social media company before Palincer. I think the main difference was like at Palincer I was given quite important projects to deliver during my internships which I knew mattered and after I left I knew they're still being used. Since I go to come back as full-time I go to verify that that what I build as an intern is being used and I think that's great. I feel like oftentimes internships you end up doing things which may be not so important and here at Palincer I really feel interns are given given projects of the same importance that what full-time employees are working on. I'm guessing you've already had a few different things to kind of way up when you were thinking about that full-time role like post university. What made you want to come back to a Serup Palincer? For me it was like it was a very easy decision to make. As soon as I got the offer I knew I want to come back. I was actually supposed to do my masters right after the internship but I felt that at Palincer especially after my experience in the internship I was learning so much. I didn't want to stop. I wanted to continue building things and learning and I thought I'd going back to university would be kind of a step back. I had a great time at uni but I just feel here the learning is so much. So there's so much more. Wow so you actually like shortened your university time to come back here. I was supposed to do one more year but I'm glad to be here. I think it was a good decision. That's an easy answer. I think anyone who wants to contribute to the world at large has to come here. The problems we tackle, the range itself is fast and I think that alone makes growth a lot more exciting at Palincer. It wasn't easy choice for me. Since coming back to Palincer as a full-time engineer what impact do you feel that you've been able to make on the Foundry platform? So that's interesting because it's kind of incredible the amount of autonomy they give to new grads like I can't believe it myself. I've been able to work on this query execution engine that powers edge environments so to think about edge environments think about like the Titan truck. To get queries from the like in the ontology owner Titan truck you would use like this environment. I'd like to say that the past few months have been some of the most teleengine but very rewarding experience that I've had in my engineering career. I've worked on multiple different products, different verticals within the company but to be more specific I've made a lot of contributions towards our in-house editing software which allows users to make cold contributions within Foundry and it's been a fun experience seeing how my contributions shaped the product and how the product has evolved right under my nose. It's been a fun experience.
