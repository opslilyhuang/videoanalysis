TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We're going through a transition where software products with power points to software products are moderately useful to people seeing the power of transformers and enterprise software. Coming here, that was it. Talking with the largest contention company here, the largest gas carrier company here, all our very important clients was here talking to them with other people from the transportation industry, talking about data, how the industry is actually working for them. Power will be believed in efficient, you know. There's so many ships that's just inefficiently burning too many fuels and getting to location destination through early, waiting at the destination, because they don't have the data from all that power should be shared. It's also the case that people have to buy software that doesn't work for decades. And so you can't blame shipping companies and other companies for being skeptical. Your brand is obviously very strong here, so we're proud to have you here with us. We're very optimistic about the creative market for us together.
