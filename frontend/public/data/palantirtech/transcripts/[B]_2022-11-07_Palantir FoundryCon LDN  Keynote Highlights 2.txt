================================================================================

Please welcome from Palente, Sasha Spidwick. Hi everybody, welcome to Palenteur, welcome to FoundryCon. We're so excited to have you here in London. We have customers here from all over the UK, from all over Amia, from every industry. Some of you have known us for a very long time. Some of you are just getting to know us. We have the unique privilege and honor of working alongside all of you every day and hearing your stories and seeing the important work that you do. And so what we're excited to do here today is to have you shed light on those stories, yourselves with each other. We're going to try to do our best to get out of our own way. And we encourage you to spend time with each other, hear from each other, learn from each other, build relationships that span far beyond this particular office and beyond Palenteur. Joining us on video, please welcome Chief Executive Officer at Murt KGAA, Dr. Bellen Garihau. Thank you for inviting Merck to be part of FoundryCon. Over 354 years and 13 generations, we have pushed the boundaries of human progress with the best available technologies. In the late 1800s, the best data technology was this, one of the first mechanical calculators that could add, subtract, divide and multiply complex numbers. And I can tell you, it was very revolutionary for that time. Since then, data technologies have really come a long way. And so too has Merck. Today, we are a globally diversified science and technology company with leading position across life science, healthcare and electronics. One of our goals is to make healthcare more personalized, more predictive and preventative. Another is to make the discovery and development of new medicines faster and more efficient. Success requires that organization go on a journey of through digital transformation and we have gone through that for many years. And I tell you, it's not easy. Most of all, our people need to be up-skilled until they become data literate. And this can only happen if you build the right culture, a rich, immersive culture where people can harness the power of data every single day. Our Foundry platform is the best possible evidence this culture is working. Every week, we have more than 4,000 consumers of data on Foundry. Most user cases are made not by IT engineers, but by staff in all areas. Customer facing, such as sales or customer support, but also in finance, supply chain management, and importantly, in our R&D. Our continuous pursuit of data driven outcomes is making Merck even more resilient. During the pandemic, we became so close that it became hard to differentiate between Merck and Palantir teams. Our partnership is based on mutual respect and a common purpose and enabled our project teams to operate with tremendous speed and impact. Thank you for standing by our side as we continue to advance human progress. And with this, Laura, over to you. Please welcome Chief Science and Technology Officer at Merck KGAA and Chief Executive Officer at Athena Laura Mertz. So I'm just going to build on a couple of the comments that Bebelin said, we're a 354-year-old company. And what that means is that as Merck, we're looking for what are the trends for the future and how can we enable the industries that we serve. So we support three different industries, healthcare, life science, and electronics. This has never been more important. These industries have been through COVID. And having this data foundation really gives us the opportunity to drive innovation. The other thing that it's given, and I think Bebelin touched on it, the partnership with Palantir, because we've had such a close partnership that's been built over the past five years. As we look at what these industries need, we've also been able to start data ecosystems, first with healthcare in 2018, and then more recently in 2021 on semiconductor. And that's what I'll give you an overview today. So diving into the semiconductor industry just a little bit, I think all of us have seen in our own daily lives the exponential increase in data, streaming services, autonomous driving, IoT of almost everything. All of these demand drivers are growing, driving the semiconductor industry forward potentially much faster than I think was anticipated. And I can tell you I've been in the industry for 20 years. There have been times where companies were talking about what is the next iPhone application. This is not the case today. The demand has is projected to increase. Now, building this much capacity creates a challenge for the industry, because the value chain that exists has to really be enabled to be resilient and bolstered. So what if Anya is trying to drive, which is a joint partnership between Palantir and Mark, is really to bring the semiconductor ecosystem together. Now, you can see in the picture the device makers are at the heart of this, because they're really driving the integration of the semiconductor device. But they rely on a very large supply chain. Equipment suppliers, packaging suppliers, material suppliers that enable the chemistries, the gases, and the chemicals that are utilized to make the devices, all of this has to come together. And I can tell you that this is truly a global supply chain. Many of these materials can only be sourced in specific regions of the world. And so being able to bring the entire ecosystem together to collaborate and share data, to identify the materials that are customized for the advanced node processes, becomes really enabling for the industry. The other key point is that it's not only about those suppliers that directly serve the device manufacturers, it's also about this extended supply chain. And the sensitivities can go back to the ore that's extracted for some of these processes. And so bringing it in that extended supply chain becomes really important. So we're working with device manufacturers and their supply chain to bring together these data streams so that we can enable the industry to move forward. And we see this as critical because if we look at the capacity expansion, over 150 billion of capacity has been announced that will come on stream from 2024 to 2030. With that level of investment, it becomes increasingly important to make sure that there's supply chain resilience in the ecosystem. And in some cases, that there's dual sourcing or local supply chains where there are critical materials. But it comes down to a couple key points and a couple key capabilities that need to be in place to make this successful. Obviously, fundamentally, you have to have a solid technology foundation. This is built on the trust of data security. And also the capabilities and the analytics that can keep trying the most advanced insights forward. It also, though, has to take into account the people and the ways of working. And this is really where we're seeing that with investment in those two areas, we start to get significant momentum. On the people side, it's not only bringing in the data scientists, but it's also training our entire workforce. As Bill said, we have 4,000 users, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. We really want, by 2024, to have 20% of our workforce trained around basic data literature. And I think this has traditionally maybe been a challenge for businesses, because, of course, some of the information is very secure. So we've now got an operating model in place that takes advantage of the foundation of the Palantir Foundry, as well as AWS, but also enables a structured way to open up the data and enable our teams to work together. Across the three very different business sectors, like science, healthcare, electronics, very different areas, very different requirements. But with this strong structured approach, we can now start to enable collaboration across. And this has been, I think, a foundational element that we've seen in the past two years that has really brought us forward. I'm honored to be here today, and I look forward to learning from all of you as well. So many thanks for the time. Please welcome Group Chief Data Officer and Chief Innovation and Transformation Officer for Corporate Solutions at Swiss Re, Ian Heycock. Hi, good morning, everybody. So as introduced, my name's Ian Heycock. I'm a Swiss Re. And what's interesting is I have this little talk today on the connected company and some of the topics have already been covered, even though very, very different industries. So I'll be very interested in his compared notes afterwards. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to talk a little bit about what we call the connected company, the data connected company, and the journey we've been on with Palantir. Making the world more resilient is at the heart of what we do. It gives us a real purpose. As I'll discuss today, data is adding new possibilities to do that. Swiss Re established in 1863. There was a huge fire, destroyed a town called Glarris in Switzerland, and that clearly showed that insurance alone is inadequate. In simple terms, reinsurance is insurance for insurers. Today we're one of the world's leading reinsurers, and you can see some of the information on the slides behind me here. We literally cover millions of risks, some of the topics this morning, very relevant to us, and in over 100 jurisdictions around the world. In addition to reinsurance, we have specialist insurance solutions, in particular for our corporate clients, and one of our goals would be to move beyond insurance and into a world of risk insights, which I'll talk to shortly. Just a couple of examples to try and make it real. Recently you will have seen in Florida, this is enormous hurricane, hurricane Ian. It is not a good time to be called Ian. In the insurance industry, I can tell you, I'm responsible for billions of losses, but huge damage to lives, property, massive losses for the industry. The reality is the small insurers in Florida would not have been able to cover those losses without reinsurance, exactly like in Glarris, although years ago. Generally small insurers want to grow their businesses. If they hand off risk to reinsurers, they can grow their businesses. For example, you can look at building projects, if you want to build a skyscraper that would typically exceed the risk capacity of anyone insurance company, again, reinsurance can help. There are many examples of where we as a risk company get involved with our clients and look to make the world more resilient. We consider ourselves to be a risk knowledge company. What do I mean by that? Why? Not only do we see every type of risk across the world, but we actually assess it and we put a value on it and we put it on our balance sheet. The dynamics of our balance sheet is extremely complicated. If you consider the number of enforced risks that Swiss reruns. Insurance companies and reincentre companies are also investors. The fundamental things we do is we have to invest the premiums we receive to pay out claims in the future, which can be very, very far in the future. Financial market risks are highly relevant for insurers, equity, credit, inflation, interest rates and so on. Essentially we look at the world through the lens of risk. Our job is to understand it, to find ways to cover it and to mitigate it. And what sets us apart from a typical insurer is diversification across all of these risks globally. It's just central to our business model. You can't hedge these risks. So you diversify and this will help profitability over time. But from a data point of view, it leads to fragmentation. So diversification of risk is good for business. It's not so good for data. Increasingly simply ensuring risks is no longer sufficient. I mean, we see complicated things. Cyber risks, inflation, what the cause is, what that's doing to society, climate change, longevity, really having a profound impact on how we live. And insurance is only one tool. So we need to move beyond that. We need to do more. And this is where data and insights can really help. So to achieve our mission, we need to broaden our services. By increasingly combining human expertise and real data and state-of-the-art analytics to understand the risk better, and how additional services to our clients and society. So as I start coming on to data and data connectivity, I want to talk about fragmentation. Fragmentation is a real challenge in insurance, and possibly some of the other businesses we've heard today. I would say it's the default natural state of an insurance company, at least to date. As mentioned, we have three businesses. Each of these businesses has their own CEO, their own executive committee. We have an investment decision that likewise set up. We want their own data, and they all want it in the way that they want to see it. But then so does the group. I mentioned we are in over 100 jurisdictions. What that actually means is that we have individual, legally regulated insurance and re-insurance companies in those countries that have their own board, that want their own data and so forth. And then the other one which I think is a little orthogonal is the contract itself. And the products of insurance companies, the contract that we produce between ourselves and the client. These contracts are massively complicated. Often re-insurance treaties, commercial insurance policies, many, many hundreds of pages. All of them, or many of them very bespoke. We have millions of treaties and policies. And the question is, does the data that's in your system really represent what's in that policy? And we know about technologies like NLP and so on, but they're still nascent and have limited impact on supporting this. So when I talk about a connected company, I'm really talking about gaining mastery over all of this data that represents swissry. And then joining it up so it makes sense from any needed perspective. So whether I want to look at an individual line of business or a policy or a client perspective or a particular portfolio, I want to be able to pick the company up, twist it around and find the answer that I need. What we did at swissry is we defined a data strategy around six fundamental pillars. The first one is it starts with the business. It has to start with the business. It can't start with the IT or the tech. What are the business needs? Where is it going? How does data fit in? We make the business leaders make the call. It shapes everything else. And the other thing that we do is in our different units, they're free to set these priorities and how they do this themselves. We have a common framework so we can then join up across the group. We need good foundations. You know, make the data discoverable, know what we have, good architecture design, data models which represent our business, good plans for shared master data and so forth. Crucially, we have to advance our governance capabilities at the same rate as we accelerate our ability to use and analyze the data. The workforce, the culture, we need not only upskill the workforce but we need to change the mindset of many traditional thinking staff and this is not an easy thing to do. It has to be a priority. We need to position these new advanced analytic capabilities, data science and so on alongside the traditional ones that we have. Insured companies are full of smart, analytical people, actuaries, quants and so forth and how do these things coexist, what techniques should we use, that's also a focus. And then finally the technology itself and this is when we finally come to the foundry which is at the heart of our data strategy. So how do we do it, how do we really make the connected company and this has been an interesting journey for us and you can see on the slide behind me about a third of the company is now active user of the foundry. The journey was in three stages and I'd like to say it was by design but it wasn't but looking back I could make the argument we want we went this way but it is a very, very good evolution. We started with use cases, like a real problem that has a huge impact on the company and we had several very good successes together with Palantir but then it became clear that this fragmentation challenge was limiting us. Did we really have mastery of our own data? So the next thing that we had to do is to connect so you give the individual business the most important information it needs to run itself to steer itself. So we move away from these historical IT siloed organized data worlds to a single what we call analytical data model. An analytical data model is a single representation of our businesses data. So all of the users pricing actuaries, observing actuaries, underwriters, people talking to clients are looking at the same data at the same time. People in the business using the data directly so we'll have people using Palantir foundry who are business people who are being trained up, we'll have our own technology data science experts and then we have colleagues at Palantir. So really upskilling the workforce. We've done this now in our major business areas or we are in the process, some are more advanced than others. The next step is can we really connect across the company, can we truly create a data connected company at the group level? And we believe we can and we've built one of these analytical data models in each major part and we've been working on designing what we call a logical data model which is essentially the common language to go across a different part of the company. And it's clear for all to see and we move away from this hidden operationally difficult to manage semi connected environment. We've got to be pragmatic. It's super hard to do this. So what we did is we started with problems that the company needed to solve. If we make this a theoretical architecture exercise, it will fail. And finally going back to making the world more resilient. This is the opportunity to go beyond insurance and think about insights. What about data connectivity for the wider world? With Palantir we're building a risk data services market neutral platform that will enable clients to see their risks using swissery insights or they could use insights from any other provider. And then choose to publish that on the platform. This is a really exciting step in our goal to wake them up. Please welcome Global Markets leader at PWC Richard Oldfield. So good morning everyone. It's a real privilege to be here with you today and I want to thank our friends at Palantir for inviting me to come and talk to you. Now, PWC are very excited about the partnership that we have with Palantir. And it's not because we use Foundry in our own business or we culturally work really well together. It's actually because that partnership is helping our clients deal with some of their most important problems. My main message is Foundry is super exciting and makes me excited about the future because it's an example of an innovation that will form the backbone of a new type of economist we try and deal with those societal challenges. The reason I'm excited about Foundry is I honestly believe with our minds and Foundry's technology it has the possibility to continuously refill our pipeline of dreams. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Please welcome Chief Operating Officer at Lilliam, Yves Yemmse. Good morning. It's a pleasure. It's a honor to be here with you today. So I'd like to thank Shia and his team for giving us a chance to tell you who we are at Lilliam, what we do and how we partner with Palantir to do it better and faster. So what we're doing at Lilliam, based in Germany, is basically building radically better ways of moving. That's ambitious. So why is that radical? First, we fly. We want you to fly. And that's great. I mean, most of us fly, but not the majority of humanity. Point A to point B. So I'm talking about London downtown to Heathrow. I'm talking about JFK to downtown New York. I'm talking about saving hours of traffic. So that's radically different. The second thing is that it's sustainable. While we're in the air, we don't create emissions. It's electric. Wow, that's different. So no emissions, no pollution, less guilt. Yeah, that's better because we'd better think about it as we just heard. So it's sustainable. And the last thing is for everybody. It's not for the wealthy people. It's for everybody. It has potential to reach a price point which makes it competitive with a taxi service because it's very simple. So how simple is it? Well, that's the solution we are defining and building. It's a jet. It's actually a jet. It's electric. It takes off vertically so you can reach the basically the downtown of cities. You can go into very small footprint. In fact, it's a helicopter pad. And the good news about it is it's ducted fans electric fans. So it's not noisy. Take some Francisco more than 30 different helicopter pads. Almost all of them have been shut down because of noise. So much less noise, safer than helicopters because it has redundancy. All these multiple engines. And that might also lot and zero emission. Zero emission. That matters a lot too. Wow. So that's what we want to bring to the world. And that's what we work on. Now, it has to be accessible to everybody. We didn't want to. If you some of you which have flown a helicopter is it's not a pleasant experience always. So we wanted also to make sure that everybody can have a pleasant experience inside commercial commercial development and basically being ubiquitous around the world means that it has to be a good passenger experience. So the cabin has to be basically configured in a way that is accessible accessible for everybody, even people which are physically impaired. And that's a condition we gave ourselves. So it's really for everybody. So that's what we're doing. We're actually doing that. We're started 900 employees based in many. But aerospace innovation is extremely demanding. And I know that I spent nearly two decades at the Airbus was ahead of quality for the HV50 aircraft, which most of you have flown. It's pretty safe aircraft. And it's exactly about that bringing innovation to aerospace is almost noxymoron because it has to be safe. Yeah, we don't want to create a use case for the insurance company we just saw this morning. We don't want that. Yeah, not adding one more risk because you say, oh my god, I'm not done and then certainly have the risk of this flying stuff just falling on my garden or my house. No. So how do we make it safe? Well, safety standards are on regulators to do that. We don't fly commercially if we don't have the approval for regulators. We happen to be sat in Europe with the most stringent regulator in the world, a NASA European Aviation Safety Agency. Well, they decided for this new breed of aircraft is going to be saved 10 to the minus nine exactly the same type of safety standard that we get for commercial aircraft. Now you feel safer. You do that you step into a three 20 or going seven eight seven same same level of safety. So we get into the nano safety right nano like nano metals, you know, in see my conductors you chasing one billion of a chance. And you have to demonstrate it before you get a permit to fly. That's what we're after. So it's beautiful, but inside it's pretty complex. It's kilometers of cable. It's electrical. It's new technology innovation. So why is re innovating there? First and foremost, the architecture, the this you haven't seen an aircraft like that. Have you? No, well, that's innovation. There is a reason why because it's difficult. It's a very difficult architecture. It's unstable by nature. It's a canal. The wings. So we have to modelize a lot of CFD. If you know, but there is space. You know, but modernization. You know that fluid dynamics is not linear. So you have to generate a huge amount of data just to know where you are. And then you have to test it fly to make sure that the real evidence that you accumulate with tons of data. Is matching your model, which has tons of data. Well, that's already you smell of use case for Palantium. Right. Well, but it's not only about that. You know, it's basically now building it. Operating because there will be hundreds. There will be thousands of these machines around the world. So how do you make sure that they remain safe? How do we know in which state they are? So tons of built in sensors, which are going to accumulate a lot of data. So that's our journey. And we're going to start with the first hurdle is the regulation, getting the approval of the regulator. So that's a journey. And we started with our advanced in that journey. In fact, we're already building these machines. So you don't realize, but there are a handful of company like ours, which have already gone public. We got public last year on NASDAQ. And we're already bringing these machines to the world. In the second half of the decade, they will be everywhere. Yeah, people say what that science fiction. No, it's coming. It's coming faster than you imagine. Everywhere. Everywhere around the world. If you take this industry, you take a vehicle, vertical, take off and land in. Google it. You'll see it's everywhere. Right. So we're one of them. We tend to be one of the most equipped in terms of engineering workforce and experience, et cetera. Right. And we are based in Europe. And ASI is very thorough and very committed to make us work. So we're an industrialization phase. So what it means, we're solving problems. We constantly solve problems. Well, good news. We're engineers. We love it. And we have to demonstrate. We have solved problem. We have regulators. We have to do that. We have to get the right ones. And we have to be careful about those. And they tend to be very thorough. That's our challenge. So how do we demonstrate that? Through evidence, is how do you comment? And how we basically are winning this race to safety? Winning the race to safety? It's time to safety. I spent some time in the second value. Time to market, time to volume, time to cost. Yeah, we're going to go there after. But getting to the market right now is a demonstration of time to safety learning fast. will have a demonstration, I think, a little dissapointing. Airbus is a user of panatier. And I was actually leading the first use case with the Shia and his team back a couple of years ago. So yes, we're going to do acceleration of non-quality analytics to see where could be the sources of non-quality, in non-safety. We're going to have these massive supply chains around the world. We have already suppliers in Japan. We have suppliers in the US. We are buying smart conductors. This is a flying laboratory. This machine is tons of electronics. Digital twin, I heard digital representation, we're building digital twin of the aircraft, but also building digital twin of the production system. Why the production system? Why do we care? Well, we do care because there is a regulator that says whether the production system itself is safe. That's interesting. So we have not been to demonstrate the machine is safe. But we have to demonstrate that the waste produced is safe, and it's registered. It doesn't change. And it change has to be controlled. That's demanding. And predictive maintenance here. We want to know everywhere all these machines around the world, these thousands of aircraft, where they are. Is the door OK? Is the battery pack OK? Is the flight control computer OK? We have tons of built-in test equipment that will just drop data directly without the users being aware of that. That's just basically, you know what? This is a norm today. We still want to do it from the beginning. So the beauty of being a startup will be in our ecosystem. We have hundreds of business applications already. And we have to be cyber safe, by the way. I just mentioned that that's a key element of safety cyber. You don't want anybody to fly the aircraft instead of the pilot. So we're already doing that. And that's to use case. That's almost normal now in the industry. What is a bit different is actually, we innovate faster. This race of time to safety is data driven. It's absolutely data driven. Couple of examples. We have a flight test. We have a demonstrator, which is flying in the south of Spain. You check on our website. You will see this beautiful machine, because it does exist. It flies today. We have demonstrated this flight physics. Why it works? Found the first time in the world. Well, how do we do that? We wanted to basically fly and analyze. Every single flight is incremental. We go a bit faster. We take a tight turn. So in aerospace language, we are augmenting the flight domain. We are augmenting the flight envelope. We are proving it safe with a flight envelope. Step by step, every single flight we have, we're streaming thousands of sensors and we just did data. Originals have to analyze it before getting to the same, to the same, a bit more, so incremental. The time to analyze using a bit of an interior support with our team, together with our team, we basically drastically reduce that time. Factor six, faster learning. We could fly more often. We could learn faster. It's all about learning faster, the new technology. Safety is about learning, predictive, knowing, demonstrating. We've done the same for batteries. That's new. Battery has been there everywhere. There is a lithium-ion battery on 8350. There is one on 787. I know that story. Yeah, it does work. It's not the primary source of power. It doesn't happen today. So putting batteries as a primary source of power. Yeah, you have it on your test like R. But the thing is that if the battery runs flat, you just stop and you just exit. If the battery runs flat here, we're back to the use case I discussed before. So we have to modelize it. We have to demonstrate that we know how it's working, that the flight control computer, all the sensors, know the state of health, the state of charity, aging, any potential risk of terminal runaway. You don't want to have a terminal runaway when it's flying. That be a bad news. Of course, we have to demonstrate we can contain it. That's part of the regulator. So to have to modelize all of that. And with Palantir, we've been able to test user test data, accumulate billions of data points on the sales behavior. So we can modelize it accurately. That's key part of our journey. That's an example how we do it faster. And of course, changes. This is a very integrated system. If you change something in the design on the engine, then you certainly have different aerodynamic laws on the wings, which means you have to change the structure. If you change the structure, you change the shape. If you change the shape, you change the aerodynamic laws again. So you can go inspire all development. That's a beauty of aerospace space. So all the changes are involving all our systems, PLM, production systems, CFD modeling. So how do we understand the change of changing the size of the engine? Well, it's a data game. So innovating faster, getting faster to the market means understanding faster, getting data into insights. We have tons of engineers. We have some of the best brains in the aerospace industry. We're able to recruit. But they tend to transform data into data. That's difficult. So we're trying at the management level to get this insight and make the right decisions to get the right product on the market in a safe way. So that's our journey. We don't do it alone. So we're a small company, but we're already partnering with some of the biggest names in the industry. Why? Well, they want to be part of this revolution. Evital is a revolution that is coming. And we're not the anyone. So we have different partners. You see them. Honeywell recognized flight control computer. I've unique more than 100 years of experience. So yeah, it's safe. We have a triple dissimilarity flight control computer. Go figure out. That means that basically it's redundant, triple, different route of computing, software, and hardware to make sure that all the signals are voted permanently to against one, so which means you know where you are. Handing qualities and safety. So we couldn't develop it ourselves. But we want to develop. And that's again sharing data, sharing tons of data. Same for name Denzo. Denzo is a giant in Japan, the supplier of electric engines to all the Toyota cars. So they decided, hey, they fell in love with the concept. They decided to bring to us a marvel of technology, a super integrated electric motor. In fact, we have 30 of them on the aircraft. And they deliver a performance which is just unbelievable. 3.7 kilograms, 110 kilowatt. Go to the mathematics and compare with your test list. Your since factors above. So all of that has to be developed fast. So time to safety means tons of data shared with the suppliers at the early stage. Of course, we will share later at the industrial stage. And all the use cases that I've seen today are super interesting for us. We will go there and to end from supplier to customer, in fact, as we did with Airbus. Understanding that if you know your quality landscape is predominantly the biggest headache we have to solve every single component, production systems, stabilized, everywhere. So you can target the right safety. We will do that. But first and foremost, and what's a bit different from what we have seen this morning is this innovation faster through data is a quite interesting journey. So thank you very much for this opportunity. I'm happy to discuss that. APPLAUSE MUSIC Please welcome Chief Information Officer at Fulvia, Eric Godard. MUSIC Hello. I'm Eric Godard. I did the CIO of Fulvia. So I'm very happy being with you today. I will try to tell you a bit more about the data journey for tier one in the automotive business. But before telling, speaking about data, I would like to give you a few words about what is Fulvia, because probably most of you don't know what is Fulvia. So basically, the former name was Fulvia, Fulvia. And now we are thanks to the acquisition of 80 plus percent of Hela. We have a new name, which is Fulvia. And we are basically a tier one in the automotive business. We have, let's say, big customers. And of course, Alexander BMW is one of them. We have more than 300 sites, 150,000 employees. 35,000 engineers, let's say, lots of R&D centers. So you can see the figures. And obviously, with all of that, we are creating lots of data. The vision of this Palantit, this data approach, let's say, with the CIO eyes, which is sometimes a bit different, than some other colleagues. So definitely, our CIO role is changing drastically. I take some example of those changes. We are in a world where the IT architecture with a single big ERP able to deliver everything is no longer possible. It will require much more flexibility, much more agility. Second point we need to highlight is the fact that we, and this has been already addressed this morning by some colleagues, we are no more dealing only with internal data. We are dealing with an extended company model. And we have for sure to take into account data from suppliers, customers, partners, et cetera. And this will become more and more the case. This is absolutely clear. The point as well, and this is the IT view, is that thanks to all those new systems, all the digitalization, the way we address the IT budget is a bit more mature. For sure, we are still fighting with cost. We are in the automotive business. But all in all, we speak much, much more about value creation. And this is very interesting for all of us. Another very important topic is the fact that a single team will never be in a position to create all the value which is needed. And this is clearly where entering in the world of what I call data democratization. And let's say a team of experts developing, reporting, developing analytics, this is over. For sure, we will still need that, but we need much, much more than this. And thanks to the fact, due to the fact that everybody will use those tools for sure, the user experience is more than ever important, but this is a kind of abuse. Basically, to summarize, we are in a situation where IT is moving from a kind of support function role to a real business partner role. And this is really very exciting for all of us, for sure. Now, let's jump in the data, data value acceleration program of FOVIA. We have three pillars. The first one being what we call the hardware digital productivity. So basically, this is all linked to automation, what is linked to automation, AGV robots, et cetera, including the connectivity. The second one being what we call automated decision making. And this is, we put inside there all the manufacturing execution system, all the shop floor tools, digitalization at the shop floor level, the new cockpit, new whatever, et cetera. And the last one, and this is the one we'll highlight a bit more today, is what we call the data driven business productivity. So this is basically all the value that we can create towards the data collection and all the, let's say, usage of data that we can leverage. And so basically, we have those three pillars. So if this buzz is slide, I will go very fast on it, but this is just wanted to show you the architecture, because I was explaining that the architecture is changing. And basically, this is the FOVIA landscape. So on the left side, you have the, what we call central data center, basically all the standard tools we all of us have, standard EAP, PLM, et cetera. This is still on-prem. We are moving more and more towards cloud application. And this is already part of the modularity I was highlighting. So basically, we decrease the size of the core system in order to leverage plenty of very, let's say, more easy to use tools around SAS tools, whatever the tools are. And we have as well what we call the distributed IT, which is very important in a company, where we have 250, 300 plants. Obviously, we have lots of MES manufacturing execution solution at the level of the plant. So basically, we have plenty of different solutions. Already, so for this, in order to leverage all of that, we need a data platform, obviously. And historically, we had already the business intelligence, more or less everybody has it. We were mainly producing, to be honest, out of this business intelligence report out of SAP. And this was absolutely not enough. This is not enough anymore. That's why we decided to move towards a big data approach in order to make sure that we are able to collect all the data coming from all those different systems, plus, by the way, some from the external databases. And the advantage, the reason why we took parents is the global integration, because we are able to not only to collect the data, but as well to prepare those data, to transform those data, to create the famous ontology in order to make sure that we jump into the democratization. So this is basically the architecture we put in place. We made that decision a bit less than two years ago, to move to, we started with parents a bit less than two years ago. Then what we are today, after, let's say, 20 plus months, so I will not detail all of that for sure, but you see that we have already 35 sources connected, which is quite a lot, because the sources can be big. SAP, for instance, is one source. A PLM is another source. So now, basically, I'd like to finish with the benefit where we are after those 20 plus months of less experience with parentia, which is clear that now, we have a full data integration across an extended company, because we use for the automotive business, for instance, everybody knows the IHS database. Well, we have all the forecasts and so on. For sure, all of that is integrated. What's important for us is the world deployment. Once more, developing use case is quite easy. We can easily develop use case. Deploy those use case within 300 sites is another challenge. And this is where we are pushing, what we are pushing for. Basically, after, let's say, several months, let's say, less than six months, we were already able to deploy some use case within the 300 plants. We are consuming lots of raw material. And this is not needed to consume more than expected. It's even the pure waste of money, and it's not good for our customer. Well, if we consume too much material, we're just creating parts which are too heavy. This is not at all what our customer wants. We need to be at the really right level, which is very challenging. And for sure, for that kind of use case, parentia is very useful. But just an example, we have plenty of use cases in the purchase environment, in different domain of the company, which makes the topic very interesting. And now, for sure, we continue. Today, we have 100 concurrent builders, so meaning that 100 guys out of the IT organization are developing use cases, which is completely new. Before this approach, everything was developed by my team internally. And for sure, we were always bottleneck for those business intelligence reports. This is now over. We are spreading that all over the company. And then the journey is continuing. So we have 40 case use cases which are deployed right now. 700 users are using this daily. And obviously, we will continue. And then we are feeding the pipe, which is very important, is to make sure that we are generating new use cases on permanent basis to continue the savings. So to conclude where we are, so we consider, and this is recognized by the business, that we have made lots of savings with this. Basically, if you remember my street pillars of the digital transformation, we have the automation, I would say, the MES plus and the data. Basically, we can consider that. Almost 50% of the savings are generated through data. 20% through the MES part and 30% to the automation, which is AGV and so on. So 50% of the savings are created thanks to those data use cases. This is very, very important. We bought a lot several months ago, which is a kind of big group for us. And obviously, we want to create plenty of synergy. And we will not create this synergy by replacing all the back of this ERP in two seconds. We will do that for sure. We will harmonize that. But it will take years to do so. That's why we've decided to jump immediately with parent here on the other side as well, in order to say, OK, with the current backbone, we'll collect all those data and we'll generate new use cases, new other new use cases, or we will reuse the use case. The use case we have already with in forciar in order to create immediately that synergy and not waiting for the global harmonization. That's it for the journey. Thank you for your attention.
