TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi, I'm Chad Wolquist. I'm an architect at Poundtier. We talked about warp speed and specifically, Merp speed before with Meredith. Thank you for joining me again. I am super excited because Meredith is showing off some really cool new developments in warp speed beyond just Merp speed. So we want to share that with the world today. So thanks for joining me again, Meredith. Yeah, thanks for having me. We've got a lot to show today. Yes, so maybe you can give just kind of a quick update. We focused last time on really the MRP processes and warp speed, but maybe what to expect. We have been very busy for the past year, busy building everything you see on the screen here. I mean, I think it makes sense that we started with Merp speed kind of as the foundation and the backbone of what this new operating system could look like. But since then, we've expanded into engineering, into bomb management, PLM, MES space. We're doing a lot of continued work and supply chain program management work with a lot of the primes as well. So it's really exploded over the past year. It's been pretty exciting, but most exciting, I think, just to see how far the product has come. Yeah, and I think this is what I love about the graphic on the screen right now is, you know, to think about like how does warp speed fit into the kind of the bigger, palatory ecosystem. And if you think about, you know, AIP and Foundry is an operating system. You're building these applications as part of that operating system of the larger Foundry and AIP use cases, but it's cool to see. Now we have these opinionated like applications and workflows and entire modules, essentially, for business to work with and like get up and speed and move really quickly. Yeah, and we've talked for a long time at Palantir about the connected company and a vision for what that could look like in Foundry. I think what's really neat about warp speed is that we are so opinionated about it. And, you know, we've kind of gone through the reps to earn the right to have an opinion on how you should be doing all of this, but all from a really first principles decomp of the problem space. This is not based on what, you know, someone who's been in the industry for 20 years thinks an MES should be. This is based on what is the technician on the production floor today need and let's work backwards from there. Very cool. All right. Well, let's take a look at it. Okay. So for today, we're going to be looking at a notional shipbuilder. We're going to be making a Santa Fe vessel. If you don't know a lot about shipbuilding, you'll learn it along the way. I'm sure. But you could use this for manufacturing anything, you know, UAVs, USVs, fighter jets, trucks, nuclear reactors, space stations, anything you maybe thought was cool as a little kid is a great fit for warp speed. But it's beyond just, I would say it's beyond just the defense industrial base too. Like you're saying, like trucks, other manufacturing, like all of these things are important to take raw materials to produce a finish gun and sell it. And so it's like anybody that's doing that, which is literally like almost everybody. I think this is Apple couple two. Yeah. Yeah. So to start with, I'm going to put on my quality engineering hat, so to speak. And we're going to walk through how a quality operator can action a quality issue. And what that means for the rest of this connected company, how that impacts your engineering and design updates, your work construction updates, picking cut over days for the new design, what that means for your supply planners, of course, in MerpSpeed, what that means for your technicians on the floor. So kind of just pulling on this thread of there was a quality issue on a build. And that is going to open the doors to a lot of fixes required. Jumping in straight to my open quality issue here, this is a problem with our bit three. If you guys don't know what a bit is, this is a bit that goes right on the deck of the ship. It's kind of what you used to tie the ship up. And we have to measure the weld throat width of this bit after it is installed. And we recently had two of these come in that have fallen outside of the acceptance criteria for this measurement. And I can see actually that all of these were passing until very recently. So of course, the question I need to understand is why. And I also can see this is a safety critical part. This is what we would call a P0 at Palantir. So it's really urgent that we figure this out. You don't want these coming unattached and flying all over the deck of the ship, of course. To understand what the root cause of this weld issue might be, we're going to leverage the ontology and find all of the related events in our warp speed ontology to this specific part. So you could imagine doing this on your desktop would be very challenging. You would have to go search many systems. You would have to know what is the bill of materials leading up to this assembly. What are the different tools getting used? What are my engineering changes that have come through? Who did the installations? When were they done? It would be a lot of manual, manual data collation. Yeah, I think that the part you're getting out there too that's always interesting is it's not just my view of the world today back through time. I have to know what was the what was the view of the world at the point in time. And I think that's a uniquely harder problem to be able to, you know, kind of take that and actually look back at those different points in time. How were things actually happened? Was the bill material different there? Who was working on it all? But that's not just through today's kind of the current state. And that is a really tough problem that we make super easy with ontology. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, from a sort of philosophical perspective, time is what makes all of these problems so challenging. If you had all the time in the world, you could make a perfect production plan. And then if you freeze time, it's perfect forever. But of course, that's not the reality we live in. Yep. So the events that have been returned from my search here, I'll just run through them quickly. First, we had a purchase order delivered. We had some stainless steel. This is a raw material. And we're pulling that via the MerpSpeed ontology, where if you remember from the last demo, we can actually see which individual purchase orders are allocated to which work orders and which top level assemblies. So we know exactly what batch of stainless steel essentially was used on this. Then we also had two updates on the tools actually used on the floor here. So it looks like a new welder came online in July. And then we retired the old welder in August. I had one customer who used to joke that all of the tests they do are really just testing the test equipment. So you want to make sure the test equipment or the regular equipment for that matter is is pick and span. And then we also had two engineering change notices come in over the summer. So this is when we actually change the design of the ship. One of these was on a chalk and the other was on a bulwark, which is also on the hull of the deck. Just by looking at the dates and these two ECNs, definitely my suspicions are are kind of high that these could be the culprits. And I could drill into each of these ECNs and get really deep into the technical drawings and what was updated. Or I could just ask my AIP disposition agent over here to do that for me. And so the the critical feedback that I'm getting from this agent is that this bit is actually an interfacing part to the bulwark. So that means they're actually touching each other. So when we think about why this world isn't going correctly, you know, it makes sense that it's because the piece it's welded to got changed. And if the root cause of this failure is our ECN, then the next thing we want to do is actually essentially file this non-conformance report and send it over to design engineering to update. So we're going to create a disposition for a design engineer to review. I've got a little summary of my findings here. And when I submit that, it's going to essentially package all that information together for me and throw it over the fence to the next person down the line to action. So I'll be that next person down the line. Well, it's an important thing though to like to just call out like in workflows so often is that emails, multiple systems, communication, so many different opportunities for things and information to get lost. And the fact that you had all the context of why and how already there, and I can pass that context to the next person that needs to go make these changes, like that is so valuable because on both sides, people would normally have it be to go find and figure out what information it's like potential for loss, time, all sorts of things. So like that is like another key point of the connected company, the ontology, be able to pass around that context. Yeah, and there really shouldn't be any ad hoc manual data collection basically. You should be able to sort of have the full traceability of this investigation in the platform absolutely. And you'll see from here on out how that kind of explodes into all different roles in the operating system who are going to continue reworking this bit. So if I now put on my design engineering hat, I have been told, okay, we think there's a problem with this design. Can you take a look and maybe revise it? So I've got the whole bundle here that quality just sent me of the non-conformance report, the two failed inspections and the Bullwork ECN, which we think is potentially the root cause here. And again, I could start deep diving and jumping into all of this really manually, but maybe not a surprise to our audience. We have another AIP agent here who can help. And so this AIP agent is actually going to make a recommendation for how we should change the design because these are interfacing parts. It's identified that this is a geometry interference. So basically not line flush. And we need to change the bit to make it compatible with the version 14 of the Bullwork. So in order to do that, I'm going to create a new ECN, a new engineering change to address those issues. And for the sake of the demo, I'm just going to upload a design that I already had here. And so this is like a new cab drawing of the change design. Yes, exactly. So here we have, I mean, it looks to the human eye similar, but this will now be bit version 7. So we're up revving from version 6. Very cool. So now maybe just the diff too of like this before would have been multiple different systems, potential handoffs, integration of unstructured data, going back to looking all over the place, spreadsheets, emails, things like that being passed around. But here now it's all integrated in one place with the changes, the history, the context. So maybe from a, not only from a user experience, this is great, but from a speed, time to value, quality, not dropping important details, that's all just here. Yeah, I mean, what we've walked through so far could take someone weeks to do manually today, even identifying what's the root cause of a quality issue is typically a pretty labor intensive process and time intensive process. The other thing I want to add is that we're already sort of plugging into other parts of the warp speed OS here by getting a automated desired effectiveness date for this change. We're actually leveraging all of the configuration management work that we've done over this year to identify what is the best time to cut this change in based on scrap cost and inventory cost and what's going to have to be reworked and what's the lead time on the new part. There's all kinds of ways you can model the objective function here and you could imagine layering in a lot of complexity. Since this is a safety critical part, the objective function here will just be pick the first date possible so the soonest we can get this part released and on the line. But for a non-critical ECN, you might want to be a little bit more strategic in how you're phasing these in and out. Very cool. So I'm going to go ahead and accept this change, which will actually right be updated designed back to my PLM. And now I need to make sure that everyone else in my organization is tracking this change and actioning anything that might be required. So all of the different reviews you see on the screen here are going to actually branch and go to all different people across the organization and really different roles to make sure that everyone knows the bit 6 is now bit 7, which should not use bit 6 anymore. When I send those requests out, you know, that could be something that lands in your email inbox. It could get a notification in the platform or, you know, a task style workflow. So there's all kinds of ways you can actually manage the task tracking as well. But not an email thread just to hit that home. Yep. So now you're saying like, okay, so I've generated all those changes. And in parallel, a ton of people need to go do things whether I'm, you know, I'm working on, you know, the different mes pieces and I need different work instructions where I want to do scenarios for my material planning. All those people now can work in parallel and in sync on these changes all initiated by you from the start. I need to change this safety, safety critical issue. Let's go. And so let's coordinate. Yep. And if we think about the most urgent tech that you might need to make, you actually want to flag on the factory floor. Is anyone installing this bit today? Like, are they installing it right now? Because if so, we're going to have to rework that. So you can send a notification to any open tickets on the factory floor of, you know, hey, go hands off here. Don't install this bit. We've got a new one coming your way. A slightly less urgent, but, you know, still critical review might actually be on the supply plant inside. And this is another pretty cool hook into the rest of the operating system here where when we create an ECN, we can now actually have that automatically build a suggested scenario for MerpSpeed. So as a supply planner, when I hear, oh, we're going to change this part. I don't have to go digging through the weeds or even build my own scenario. I'm just going to accept this one and add it to my scenario manager here so that I can compare it with my production scenario. Since this again is safety critical, I probably don't have much of a choice to accept it, but it's still good to, you know, understand what is the potential impact. You guys might recognize this screen from the last demo. I'll go ahead and compare my MerpSpeed production. So this is, you know, what we're actually executing our plans off of with my revised design of bit. I've got a little AIP summary at the top here. It looks like the purchase order cost and the lead time increased, not a lot I can probably do about that. My total work orders also went up. There's probably some rework that's happening once we make this change over, but overall, this is nothing too crazy for me to go back to the engineers and say we should think more carefully about this. So I would probably just go ahead and merge into production and then any order that is going to get cut before the Efectivity date will just check the lead time and make sure if it's going to fall within the old bit revision, we won't edit it, but if it's passed the Efectivity date, then we want to make sure we're setting the stage to have all the right inventory on hand. Wow, okay, that's pretty cool. I just even think about okay, I have scenarios and I'm like I am branching, emerging, my business, my MRP, my that's the fact that I can play out different scenarios across different branches, just like we are software. Now my business as code is truly the concept that we're working on here. Yeah, and you can do that for any engineering change notice. You could do it for even upstream of that on new product development. Anytime you're considering switching a supplier, any little disruption that you might want to sort of game out ahead of time, what is this going to look like? Yeah, I think that's an important thing. The future state too. I get the question all the time of this is great to show me how I operationally make decisions, but I also want to plan for this thing that doesn't exist necessarily in my system. I don't necessarily have transactions, but I want to figure out how that's going to impact my scheme of producing today, because I'm changing and adding something new or whatever. So I think that future state to hear to play out scenarios is also equally as important because it allows you to understand the impact on your operations, rather than write in how that's actually going to change the way you do things. Totally. And you know, something that comes up a lot with our newer warp speed customers is how do we culturally go through the change management of having new tooling like this that really might change the way someone is doing their day to day job. And if we think about supply planners as an example, you know, everyone kind of noodles in the back of their head. Do I think this is a good idea or a bad idea? I've got this intuition. It's going to be really expensive or have a really high lead time. And so that's something that's really fun for me in these desk sides is now we can actually enable these subject matter experts to answer questions that they've probably been thinking of for a really long time. And so I think that helps a lot on the cultural transition too is, yeah, you got to learn how to use this new tool, but we're giving you a lot of power and we're helping you answer maybe some long lost questions that have been hanging over your head. Yeah, and I think the default for most people is like, oh, I need to plan something that's not in my master data systems, not my engineering systems yet. Oh, I'm going to exit to Excel and it lives in Excel and email threads. And then someday we'll get back in here and you've lost that entire valuable kind of change. So I think having these tools integrated so that I both have future and current all working on these branches, you know, together is pretty cool. Yeah, yeah. So the next thing that we need to address with this new bit design is actually the work instructions for our vessel. And this is probably one of the most manual transitions where you would get notified there was an update to this part. Then you would go find the relevant work instructions. You would read through them. I mean, maybe if you're lucky, you could Apple F, but a lot of the times it's reading through looking at the drawings, trying to understand where this part is relevant and used. And if you're just making one single Santa Fe vessel, then maybe it's not so much, but you could imagine some of our customers have thousands of skews. And so understanding where a part is used within each individual work instruction is very complicated. We can automatically redline now these work instructions, though. So again, using AIP, we identify where in all of these documents, the part is referenced, whether that's by name or by part number or even looking for, you know, the visual match of what the part looks like. And then automatically redline all of those operations so that we know that they have to be edited. You can also come in here and address the sequencing of your work instructions. We're doing a lot of pretty cool work on how do we actually break work instructions down into really modular packages so that they're standardized across your whole business. But in this particular case, actually the only thing we need to do is make sure that everywhere our bit is mentioned. We want to reference bit seven, the new bit and not bit six, the old bit. And if we don't do this, then all of the work we've done on engineering and design and the supply planning work is totally a moot point because folks on the production floor are going to be installing the bit incorrectly or they're going to be picking up the wrong piece of inventory. So this is really how you make all of the change work real and ensure that it's really impacting the production floor. I have four different op cards here that reference my bit and an op card is really a subcomponent of work instructions. So we have the work instructions for the whole whole assembly up here. That is broken down into 31 different op cards and four of those op cards touch the bit. Then within each op card we have individual tasks. So the first task here is we're going to fit and track the bit. We've automatically updated it to version seven both in the actual visual here as well as in the mapping kind of in the back end. And then the second task here to weld the bit, we've gone ahead and automatically updated as well. What I want to point out is another little AIP suggestion here to add a photo requirement. This is something that comes up quite a bit in some of the really finicky manufacturing if you imagine making a rocket engine for example, all of the measurements have to be extremely precise. And so by taking photos you're both collecting data where you can actually run some of those evaluations and conformance checks automatically. But as you mentioned earlier, you're also building out the asset of what did the world look like at this point in time. So if we have a question on gosh, this weld said it was measured fine, but I wonder what it looked like. How else could we have caught it? Now we can actually enforce that collection on the floor, which is pretty cool. Yeah, that's very cool. But I think the cool thing I'm seeing from a technology standpoint here, there's multimodal stuff I've got, you know, structured stuff for my systems. I have the ontology backing components. I have, you know, unstructured PDFs and work instructions I'm updating. I have photos I'm going to add in like, it truly does need multimodal data to like represent the ground truth in these scenarios. Without multimodal data, like just looking at grids and charts and things like that just doesn't cut it. And I think you have to work in this world of like multimodal data, especially for things like work instructions. Yeah, and when we started with MerpSpeed, I mean, MerpSpeed's the best. I will always love MerpSpeed so much. All of the supply planning data is tabular though. So when we were building that actually in the Foundry platform, we weren't really doing anything revolutionary. It was just kind of the bread and butter of ontology and really great branching and data integration. But now that we've expanded into all of these other surrounding areas, we are dealing with a lot of non-tabular data. And I think it's allowed us to really push the boundaries in the platform of what we're actually building. Yeah, this is pretty neat. This is a very rich interface to really understand like, what do I need to do as well? So the time from like, oh, I need to update work instructions to like, oh, here are the four things I need to update. That gap can be pretty big from the, I know I need to update something to, here's what you need to update. And to give that suggestion pushed for users is a huge accelerant. Yeah, it accelerates the Palantir engineers as well because the Wurf Speed engineer doesn't come into this project knowing how to install a bit and what the weld should look like and all of that. So I feel like it's kind of the self-affilling prophecy of the better the tooling, the faster we can move and the better the tooling and then the users are happy and the faster we can move again. Yeah, it's all about the outcomes. The next step here once I'm happy with my updates is actually to release these new op cards into an updated version of our work instructions. For the sake of time, we're just going to go ahead and release this first one, but you know, real life, we would probably go in and review each of the red line sections just to make sure that there's nothing slipping through the cracks. And then the question is, okay, how do we actually get folks doing this weld install to use these new work instructions? And so for that, we're going to jump into another tool. We're also going to sort of fast forward through time and assume we are now past the effectiveness date and everyone is using bit seven. All right. And I'll open up our build assembly assistant. And the last to me be final hat I'll put on for today is as a technician on the production floor or in the shipyard. I've just closed my first task here of fitting the bit and now it's time to move on to my to my weld. And you'll notice that as soon as we open this page, we actually kicked off this timer in the lower left hand corner. So we can now track cycle time of each individual task and each op card. We can use that to do all kinds of advanced analytics on quality issues or performance or what's a really clear work instruction versus what's a work instruction. Someone's got a reread five times. So this is pretty helpful again just building that data asset as we go to keep enriching our operating system with smarter and smarter decisions. Yeah, I like the feedback loop you're talking about here of getting that getting that straight from the people on the factory for helping them accelerate, you know, through their work by having good clear instructions that are up the date. But also that feedback loop of when they're not, you know, people talk about it. My data needs to be perfect before I can do a I absolutely not actually it should be imperfect with a good process for people to give feedback and correct. And I think that's like this is a great example of if you're really out on the factory floor doing this stuff and you're like, man, that was not clear because the person made this a sit over here and done it. Like giving that feedback loop of whether it's on work instructions or hey, I had something's not compliant, right? I think those are the interesting parts here of like we truly are creating the Udalupe for manufacturing. Yeah, one of the coolest things I saw one of our teams build recently won't give away too many details, but basically they saw a repeating pattern in quality issues which they were able to extract with AIP that a particular screw was getting installed facing the wrong way. And it was causing all kinds of disruptions to the line. And the screw wasn't getting caught until it had moved further into the assembly process. No one was like checking this one individual screw. And so they were able to just automatically make the recommendation as soon as they ingested all the data of hey, you should go fix your work instructions so that it says install the screw you know north south instead of east west or whatever. And you should also have someone check the screw when it's coming off of this production step a little bit earlier than when you're catching it. And something as small as that you know it kind of feels like a no-brainer when you say it out loud but no one would have the time to be parsing through thousands of these op cards and thousands of these quality issues to actually be drawing those patterns. Yeah, I mean it's really easy for me to sit here and say that in an office, but when you're on the factory floor trying to do that it is a whole other ballgame of complexity. Yeah, it's not always clear what people were intending. So I think that's cool that we can now give both sides the feedback loop and we can help find issues and correct them sooner. I think that's just the fly we were talking about with workspeed. Yeah, yeah. And you know really we want to get folks on the floor pushing less paperwork and doing the stuff they're really uniquely good at whether that's drilling holes or you know cutting these pieces or welding this bit. So that's been also kind of a fun goal for us along the way. Yeah, I'm always surprised how much when I talk to people out in the field of how much time they're spending on paper and systems rather than building. And I think that's really our goal is to get more more time building less time in Excel and spreadsheets and in paper. That's right. Imagine if you were doing paperwork seven hours a day and then a video one hour a day every day. Yes, that would not be fun. I'm going to go ahead and upload an example here of this weld. And gosh, I thought that would show us a preview but I can promise you it's not that exciting. I wonder if I could drag it in here. There we go. So that's our welds that we've just completed. We're going to upload that photo into our warp speed ontology. And then the last step here is to actually measure the weld fruit width. And if you remember, this is where we started the whole demo and the quality operator with the issue that these were coming in sort of out of bounds. If I put in a measurement here that is outside of our accepted bounds, we're now going to automatically create a non-conformance report. And that's going to land in the top of the queue for a quality operator. It's going to be tagged safety critical because we know that this is a safety critical part or a step. And that would really kickstart this whole investigative process. But you know, maybe I just fat fingered this. We just released a new part. I like to think it's going to work. Okay. So I'll go ahead and submit this with a in-bounds measurement. And you'll see we've now closed our op card here. We'll be able to move on to the next card and progress through the rest of the whole assembly. And I just want to jump back really quickly to our factory lens to show that while we can track all of these on the individual technician and individual task basis, we also can aggregate all of that so that you have a complete understanding of what's going on on my production floor today. What are the open tasks? What are the tools checked out? Who's working on this? What's the crew schedule? And then you can start to layer in even more kind of advanced process tooling, for example, give everyone in their build assembly assistant the capability to you know, throw a flag that they need an inspector to come and check something. So maybe the weld didn't quite look right and I want to get a sign off from it. Or you could even build out like roll-based permissions on that to say in order to close this task card, you need to be a technician with a certification in advanced welding because we want to make sure that we're having the right people sign off on the right events on the floor. Yeah, no, I think that's cool to be able to connect all the micro decisions to the macro kind of management of things, but then also being proactive of like finding these things, whether it's I need a maintenance techism, some machines malfunctioning this person that has stopped their work order or whatever. But then you think about the other primitives that I've shown across the platform to like dynamic scheduling. How do I get the right people at the right point at the right time? Dynamic scheduling. So it's like that operating system picture of warped speed being integrated in this larger ecosystem and the operating system of your business means I can just continue to build out to value added stuff across everything I'm doing. That's pretty neat. Yeah, yeah, I mean really any demo, someone sees on your on your channel or on volunteer's channel, you know, could and should be a part of warped speed in the end. Like you should be doing all of your procurement work in here. You should be doing your logistics and transportation. We're even funnily enough getting more into kind of the almost HR like people management space of who's doing what work when how are our labor hours breaking down between different projects? Who should we be recertifying to do a new kind of task? Or are we going to have a gap in headcount next year? What would be the best profile to fill that? I mean, because the problem is the surprising one. It comes to finance too. Like you think about cost of goods sold. The fact that I have this granular of connected information about, you know, how I'm manufacturing, whose manufacturing, rework all these things. Like I can actually get very granular onto what it actually took me to produce a finished good and understand my profitability because it's funny so often do I find that companies that the thing they think is most profitable is often actually really not. The thing that's least profitable, they're doing less of is actually more profitable. And it's because things are managed at that kind of macro level where here we can still manage at that level, but it comes from the place of the most detailed and important breakdown of how your business is operating. Yeah, and then you can see all of the bottlenecks across all of it. I mean, it's very similar to what we talked about in Merp Speed a year ago that you might think, oh, if I hire another person, I could now be getting twice as many tasks off the line, but you might not realize, well, the issue actually is that we only have one inspector on the floor every day. And so even if you're making all of these widgets faster, they're still just going to sit in a queue to get inspected up the next station. Yeah, I think in my mind, this is like lean manufacturing brought into the 21st century into the real world operation. I think that's being able to analyze those bottlenecks and find the right places to allocate resources is so important. Yeah, yeah. And then maybe the last couple of things I'll just plug and I don't think we've got time to keep running through so much of the demo, but two things I'm really excited about for the next couple of months in in 2026 is our work in program management. So this is more defense specific. How do you actually track spend on a government program? How do you track, you know, your forecasting, any issues you might have on the production line? There's oftentimes all kinds of contractual obligations relating to that. And, you know, sort of how do you take everything that we just saw in this demo, but then slice it by program rather than by product line? And I think the nuance in that is kind of special to the defense industrial base. And so that's an area where we've really taken a lot of ground this year, which has been pretty cool. And then the other one is in supply chain resilience. This has been really top of mind for me recently. We're doing great work in country of origin, identification for incoming shipments. And that actually started by scanning the physical packing slips and and identify what are all of the cues or tells here that maybe this package came from a country that we weren't expecting it to come from. But it's grown since then to include ownership structure and more like KYC or anti-money laundering to actually understand who are the entities behind your suppliers and who are the entities behind those? And how can we enrich that with open source data or, you know, port shipment data or ownership data so that when you're going through your next procurement cycle or you're cutting an ECN and you need to find a new raw steel supplier, you're taking some of these more macro resilience ideas into consideration. And it isn't just about lead time and price. And so I think that has been a pretty cool piece of work. But again, the the reason that you can do all of that is because you have this rich data asset across your warp speed ontology. So you know exactly where you should be asking these questions. Yeah, I mean, it just comes back to the thing I keep harping on is the connected nature, right? There is so much information in metadata about how things relate to each other in the connected pieces that people often forget. Just think about the data itself, but the connections, the meta components, the relationships that are multiple orders removed are sometimes the most valuable thing. But in traditional systems, those are very hard to get. And I think that's really where all this comes together and why warp speed so cool and wide ontology and the stuff we're able to execute on and how now like you're talking about all these other things we've done elsewhere, now just fold into this to actually make this an even richer product. Yeah, and it's a lesson that I keep forgetting and I keep relearning, you know, maybe on a more personal note throughout the warp speed journey. Oftentimes we sort of stop and wonder like, who are we to tell these incredible companies how to build a rocket or how to build a ship or how to build a fighter jet. And you know, what what right do we have to hold these opinions? And there's so many experts in each of these individual fields who've been doing this for so long. But then every time I come back and look at the warp speed product, I'm like, oh, it's the ontology. That's what gives us the right to have the opinion here. And you take it so for granted working out of Palantir because you're just working on on top of the ontology every day and makes everything so easy. But it's just been funny to kind of catch myself on that thought train so many times of like, oh, I don't know. Should we build an MES? That seems kind of crazy. But then you stop and think, well, actually, what do you need to build a great MES? You need an ontology. And sometimes it's that simple. And I talk about this in just kind of software in general of generally when I'm buying package software, I'm buying the software and an opinion about how to like run this business process. And I think generally, you've always just been like, we're going to deliver a great software and we want your opinion. I think this is really the instantiation of now we're talking about actually like, we are opinionated about how you should run this. Now we have malleable ways to make it so that you are more different, not more similar. And like, how do we bring all that together? I think the ontology is again, the key there to really making that malleable software that allows you to actually encode your differentials and what makes you special as a company while still running in a non-full custom like software stack that I can like actually maintain and change over time. It's that sweet spot that I think we've hit with Warp Speed and then all of the kind of the learnings that we have earned through the ontology. Well, thanks for showing us. I mean, this was incredible to see the full tour of what Warp Speed is really turning into and giving people kind of a peek behind the curtain here. It's amazing what you built just in year. I'm like super excited to see what you and the team build in the next year. Yeah, thank you. It's definitely been my favorite year at Palantir. It's been such a crazy, crazy adventure and definitely big shout out to all of our Warp Speed partners. I mean, really view them as partners and not customers because we want to be here without, without them trusting us to go after these problems. So I'm excited for the next 12 months. Maybe I'll be back sooner with a couple new demos we'll see. Yeah, anytime and we are happy to show the world about Warp Speed. So thanks, Meredith. All right, thanks, Dad.
