TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I am so excited to be here. Me too. I want you guys to do me a quick favor before we get started. Just let me just let's always take a deep breath in. I'm breath out. That's good. Okay. I think we can start. It's having fun. Okay. Yes. My name is John Birch. Devon Yates. And we wanted to come and talk to you guys about data and people. And why it's important to have both that you really can't plan on doing anything successful unless you have data and people working together. Not just people, though, right? You don't just throw warm bodies at a project. You need highly technical people forging a highly trustworthy relationship with business people that know how to use that data. And so you're going to see this theme throughout our presentation that these things are important. So PG&E Todd did an amazing job for SCE. He guys give you a little bit of a backdrop. We've got this very similar situation, right? Very large service territory, very old company, over 100 years old, 16 million customers, right? So just, yeah, a lot to deal with there, right? So let's talk about the last five years. A little bit more than five years ago, Devon and I got locked in a room by Jay Singh. I know you're watching out there. Jay. And one of our incredible leader at our company. And our jobs would basically be the human versions of Foundry. We had to pull together data from everywhere that you could possibly think in our company. Smart meters and everything about our grid to try to understand what was going on, what happened behind all the 250 plus fires that started in the... On October 8th, 2017. And it's been kind of year after year really, really devastating for this state, right? We had campfire in 2018, Kincaid, lightning complexes. You name it. It's been a rough, rough go. And we're tired. But we're still going, okay? Along that way, as Todd brought up earlier, we introduced a new program called PSPS. Public City Power Shut-Off. And when we first started using it, it was before we started working with Palantir, it was a rough process. Our data was still all over the place. Lots of Excel sheets, lots of people. Emails and power. It was impossible to keep track of the number of customers that were going to be impacting where were the areas that were part of the forecast. It was tough. So when we first encountered Palantir, we of course wanted to try to tackle this big problem with PSPS. And it was amazing. In three months, we built this platform and they helped us with this, right? The point was to show us what this thing could do. And it completely changed the game. All of a sudden, we were all totally on the same page about the scope of the PSPS event, which customers were going to be impacted. And something, again, that I really liked that Todd mentioned earlier, is this gave us the opportunity to be super nimble in how we navigated those events as they evolved. So our meteorology team was releasing new forecasts every six hours for what's coming in the next four or five days. And because of this platform and because of how in sync we were able to stay, every time a new model came out, we were able to quickly pivot, understand which customers needed to be notified. And move through that. And it got us to a point where we were, we started to get very surgical with, with our events. So really amazing. Totally showed us what was possible with this platform. But wasn't enough, right? 2021, we had Dixie Fire, a million acre fire. And it opened our eyes that, you know, the PSPS wasn't going to be the solution, right? We still have a lot of work to do in terms of undergrounding. We've got to harden our wires. And PSPS was not going to be good enough to hold us over. So later in 2021, we started, we tried out this pilot. It's a fast trip, is what we call it, fast curve, some of the utilities call it. And in just a one month of it being on, it completely changed the timeline and the curve in terms of how many ignitions were occurring. It also had a huge impact to customers, though. So, right around that time, we had been about a year and a half in the Foundry. And there was this kind of a sweet spot of how much data we had already started to implement into the platform because of PSPS. And so the stars started to kind of align here where there's this cool new program. And I'm going to show you some little kind of videos to give you a sense of what is EPS. EPSS stands for enhanced power line safety settings. And so, you know, it's kind of the evolution of our fast trip program. And you can see a side by side view of how powerful this technology is, like how much energy is actually being mitigated by these devices. So, there's over 90% of the fault energy that would normally be released by a fault is what's getting completely cut off by this technology. And what's happening is, there's a setting that you can, that basically comes off the shelf with protected devices. And that's not a line tag. And the purpose of that setting is to actually protect workers if they're working on lines. And case something goes wrong and a fault occurs that actually impacts them. Cut the power so fast that you have a chance of actually saving their life. We discovered that this would actually have a huge impact, though, on how much fault energy is released. And you can see this just drastic difference. So, we knew quickly that this is going to be a game changer. So, this is how 2020 went, right? Amazing year. But I love the Dr. Carb stress, continue to stress earlier in the example with Ukraine. How important that heroism is part of it, right? It's not just the software that's going to make this kind of a change. The partnership that we have with Cal Fire and How Responsive, that they were throughout the course of 2022, all of our first responders, the work that we have been able to do with vegetation management. And with undergrounding and system hardening, everything played a role, right? Data and people, right, in order to actually pull this off. So, actually, I want to take a quick moment and just, I can give you guys a good round of applause for Cal Fire last year. This guy's really kept us in a good spot. So, and I know, at least my wife could not be happier with the air quality that we got to enjoy in 2022. So, let me zoom out for a little bit. Part of our presentation, what we also want to do is give you a sense of what it was like, right? How did we get here? We started working with Palantir and it wasn't just like you snapped your fingers and we had this cool EPSS program. A lot's happened in between. At the beginning of this, there was something that was really important to our, can you go back one slide? I think we might have missed the, okay, in the mind. So, at the beginning of all of this, it was absolutely crucial that some of our leaders stepped up and were willing to commit to several year engagement with this platform, right? It's not just something that you can, like, buy and plug and play and you're good to go with all of your systems. You need leaders, you need people to come together to actually make this happen. So, like Jay is one of them, right? Mike Glass is a bunch of really key players that stepped up right at the beginning of this partnership and made sure that we had the right organizations coming together and the right level of commitment from the business to do cool stuff, right? So, I want to take it like Devon speaks for a little bit about kind of the landscape and the challenges that we started running to. Yeah, very similar to Southern California, Ederson. You know, we are coming from a traditional company. We are very regulated. We are very kind of new to the digital transformation. We had a lot of use case driven development, multi-year processes to develop solutions, a lot of governance, complexity, data duplication. And we really needed to be able to move towards something that was more nimble, configurable, and where we didn't always know that answer to what we were trying to achieve when we started it. And so, we really found that in foundry. I want to talk. That's a lot I want earlier. A little bit about the process of how it felt to be a data scientist in PG&E before and after foundry. And, you know, this represents really the processes of taking a product to the customer. And we really struggled a lot with, you know, we would get our environment, we'd have to set it up, we'd have to onboard people, we'd have to get access to data, we'd have to bring data to the system. You know, then we'd work on development, we'd have to become an expert in DevOps and data branching. And then, you know, eventually near the end of the project, we'd get to the user interface, start to iterate with the customer, realize that we had problems with our data. But then the project was over. And so, we did this actually with an R&D project where we were looking to predict transformer failures. And in the old platform, we got to the end and we were ready to call the project a failure. And then we gave it one more shot with foundry. And as you can see here, it's a lot less front loaded. We get to get our tracer bullet to MVP in less than three months. And we started to see success. We sent someone, a trouble man, out to a transformer that we had identified as high risk. And the wire to the customer was actually smoking. And so we were able to mitigate that risk and continue to do so. All right. So as you're kind of hearing from Devon, we turn this corner. There's this inflection point where we started to get a sense of like, what's possible? What can we do with this thing? Kind of exciting. And again, this is where the stars are starting to, so we're really starting to align that we could, there's a bunch of data that we could use. We have this cool new pilot. So I wanted to go in a little bit more detail about how did we implement EPSS? What are we doing at PG&E with this particular program? Again, you saw earlier with those videos how incredibly impactful the technology is, the hardware. But what we decided to do is jump into foundry with both feet in this particular case, right? Rather than kind of a siloed one part of the process or one little bit of everything that's going on, we wanted the entire end-to-end process to exist inside of foundry. That meant that we had to scope exactly which devices that we were going to be targeting for enablement, using an intersection of the conductor in the high fire risk areas, figuring out what devices are upstream from them, and have that live updating every single day so that we were constantly targeting the right devices and keeping this program activated where it's supposed to be activated, and minimizing that reliability impact that we experienced in 2021. So that was a big part of it, right? And because we got in there with the beginning of the scoping, our engineers jumped right on board to make sure that they were, as they were doing the coordination to minimize the out of the impact for an individual circuit, that they were actually interacting directly in foundry to identify where they were along the process with each device. So now we knew we had engineering, we had the scoping inside of foundry, and then we actually used it to run a daily playbook. So every day we'd get a new feed from meteorology that shows us the models of where there's going to be that risk for today, right? And our operations would use the playbook looking at the devices that come out of the scoping process, that come through the engineering process, and then identify which devices they need to go to the field and figure out what profiles they need to activate. That all came through foundry. So having an end-to-end process, completely working inside of foundry, put us in a situation where all of our reporting, like the entire source of truth is actually sitting in foundry. There was no question, people weren't referencing spreadsheets or emails or whatever files they had on their computers. We had the source of truth in foundry, and it was anybody in the company that needed it to grab and get the right answers. It was very similar to PSPS. It's been a really great way to keep everybody on the same page, and no doubt played a factor in how well we did last year. I think J.B. represents this really well. There's an exuberance among the business around what we can do with this tool. There's been a real renaissance in what we're building to target our problems that we have today. Some of those are data quality. I've worked on customer misassignment where we're using smart meter data to automatically identify which transformers customers are connected to so that we can reduce misnotifications. There's a lot of work around outage management because with PSPS and EPSS, one of the costs is that we have more outages for customers. We have a hyper-targeted on reducing that impact and bringing the cost curve down while keeping the risk curve also down. There's also a lot of work around long-term planning. We've brought all of our asset risk predictions into the tool so that they can get closer to the business. They can be used all across all of our decision making, and it's really powerful. Something that's exciting about the outages is with EPSS last year, we had 2,375 outages that occurred while we had that program enabled. Every single one of those outages is a shot on goal in terms of a potential ignition. But it's also, it sucks to lose your power. We need to be better about making that not happen as much. It's actually really great that we have both the very strong incentive to mitigate those wildfires from happening and try to keep the power on as much as possible for everybody. We're using Foundry to identify better ways to do that. We're going to try and channel our inner AlexCarp and be a little bit provocative here. We want to talk also about our ongoing struggle. So proliferation of use cases, there's all this bubbling up of innovation. We also need to govern that. We need to manage those processes. We need to make sure that we're reporting the truth out that people have good information. And so I think that's our next step in this process is working through how we improve governance and data quality without suffocating innovation. I think a big part of that is people and data. So making sure that that connection between the developers, the data scientists, and the business stays fertile, stays in the iteration cycle. So what we're doing, another part of that is continuing to invest in the foundation, investing in making a solid foundation for the data to flow, but also enabling pathways for the business to contribute back. It's super key. The people in the business that understand how to use that data are working with the critical partners in our technology teams to set that ontology up in a way that's useful. So those folks aren't automatically known most of the time how to use the data. But when they're working closely with the folks in the business that do know how to use it, but I have no clue how to build a data pipeline, that's how we actually can get there. That's where we can build the future that we're looking for here. So one of the things I love about Foundry, to my question I asked Dr. Carve earlier, is that it's such a social platform. For us at PG&E, it creates so many connections between our departments, between the people that are doing the work, and it has a way of doing that that's really special to us. It's something I haven't seen in other platforms. And so I'm really excited that we're here, right? Like I was saying earlier, that we actually get to use a conference like this to potentially even forge connections across our companies, work really closely with folks like SE and others just to figure out how can we solve some of these problems. So thank you. Appreciate all your time.
