TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I got to admit, the way the dynamic of volunteer usually works is I get a lot of love on the outside, but on the inside it's like merciless beating and humiliation. However, currently I'm getting love on the inside. So I'm enjoying this. It's the nice warmth on the inside, some nice warmth I can occasionally be right. And at Palantir we have a tradition. I provide a plough commation of truth and one percent of the company rage quits. But currently we even have the rage quitting under control. So these are joyous times for us and happy holidays. I have something that's not well formed, so excuse me if it's not intelligible that I've been thinking a lot about. So we went through a phase, actually AI really began on the battlefield with Project Maven. It was using algorithms and compute. It's really changed the history of the world. That story wasn't told. I honestly begged the Defense Department to talk about it because we all wonder where the dollars are being spent. And so something really powerful and cool and scary is better. I think it's great. But even if you don't think it's great, it looks very valuable. That story didn't get told. And so then we got this first phase of the large language model and we're super impressed that something that looks softwareish can do anything. And that created a stampede of people, you know, doing science experiments. We wrecked, I'm trying to be a little less vulgar now that we're a real company. But internally we tended to compare that to the social lives of many pounterians. Virtual, unpleasant, with no result, and it's humiliating. Without going into vulgar details, you get the picture. But, and then, you know, we were talking using this obnoxious word that now has become part of everyone's vocabulary and being copied by the name, not the product, by vast enterprise software companies of yesterday year. And, but, you know, then slowly and now increasingly there's a realization that if you want to move from social life of the kind of person who gets in here to actual coonness, you've got, you need something like an analogy to, you know, get the motion to work in the ocean basically. And so, and then slowly you begin to see this and obviously super grateful that everyone is here and you're seeing it. I think the, so that's now we beginning to see it's useful. But then you can ask what is the meaning of that usefulness. And I think the reason why I'm so bullish on our company and yours and actually our nation right now is what made what makes Palantir internally, organizationally so special. And the reason why so many of the great people you'll meet in the world are either here or in other words, we're here is we constantly focused on what is the core principle the enterprise should be. So, the government has one customer, you know, who's one buyer so people typically go to the government. And then they just, you know, the government says, build me a space machine, tell me I'm smart. And everyone says, yes, space machines coming $2 billion and you're smart. And Palantir, you're like, yeah, we're just not doing that. We're going to build you the product you should have. Not the product you've asked for, not the product you say will give us money for the product you should have. And what is that? It's like taking an institution back to as a central core. So, you know, it's like, I mean, you know, people don't have to agree with this, but I know it's like, what is a country? A country has a border. What is an educational institution? You learn something. What is a military thing? We heard our adversaries and make us safer. What does an enterprise do? It produces something valuable where it's produced so the customer gets more value and you get more value. That's the nature of a business. All enterprises in the world have been built up on that core idea, but it gets divergent. So, it's like, I think that's where the world is going to go. And you're on the fun front of doing it, and I believe we can help you transform your company into its core existence and then extend that core existence into the market in a more efficient and better way and safer way. And that's what we're doing here. And, you know, again, the basic ontology foundry and whatever large language model you choose to use will help you do that. And it's a really cool ride. Very happy you're here. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. Whatever holiday you celebrate. I think it's a pretty joyous time. We're rocking here in America and enjoying it. Glad to have you here. Thanks for being here. Thank you.
