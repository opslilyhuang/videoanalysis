================================================================================

Good morning. Welcome to Palantir's second quarter, 2021 Ernie's call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our investor relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2021, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. And concerning those risks is available in our Ernie's press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-gap financial measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from gap measures. Personal information about these non-gap measures, including reconciliation of non-gap to comparable gap measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and SEC filings are available on our investor relations website at investors.palentier.com. Joining me on today's call are Shamsankar, Chief Operating Officer, Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer, and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. With the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect your over your comparisons unless otherwise stated. I'll turn the call over to Shams to get us started. Thank you, Rodney. Before diving into results, I'd like to share a bit of our latest product innovation, something that we deployed at the Global Information Dominance Experiments Guide 3 last month. We call it the Metaconstellation, and it's radically changing how satellites are tasked, the latency of collection, and it's creating a fundamental link in that AI-enabled decision chain. Over night, we orchestrated a Metaconstellation of 237 satellites by working with an array of commercial space companies. These companies have been deploying constellations of hyperspectral, radar, and elit sensors into orbit, and we are putting all of that power directly into the hands of the front lines, empowering the edge. It's one of the largest collaborative sensor constellations ever to see operational use. Here to show us more, Shinnon, who has led our work defining and building the AI-enabled decision chain. Palantir's Metaconstellation software harnesses the power of growing satellite constellations, deploying AI into space to provide insights to decision makers here on Earth. Our Metaconstellation integrates with existing satellites, optimizing hundreds of orbital sensors and AI models, and allowing users to ask time-sensitive questions across the entire planet. What are certain questions like where are their indicators of wildfires or how are climate changes affecting crop productivity and when and where are naval fleets conducting operations? Metaconstellation pushes Palantir's edge AI technology to a new frontier. As we all know, submarines present threats to the U.S. and its allies. And to protect strategic interests, allied forces need to track every submarine's deployment around the world. And at the forefront of this challenge are anti-submarine warfare officers. They turn to Metaconstellation to monitor ports across the Pacific. Let me show you a little bit about what that looks like. In response to allied monitoring requests, Metaconstellation dynamically determines which orbiting sensors are available. Integrated through Palantir, the constellations then collaboratively schedule coverage over each port. Meanwhile, Apollo for edge AI assigns tailored AI micromoddles to each satellite. Running onboard the satellite, the models will automatically find submarines and stream those insights directly to users. With the mission planned, Apollo automatically reconfigures each of the satellites pushing the right micromoddles into orbit. And as a software payload on board, Palantir's edge AI platform connects complex satellite subsystems to models integrating new AI with the hardware. The best part, my favorite part, is that as it orbits, the edge AI platform hutswaps the right micromoddles in. Rapidly reconfiguring the satellite. The models process imagery, they detect submarines, geolocate them, and then determine any movement since the last collection passed, all in under a second. On the AI sees a submarine movement that insides directly downlinked to allied forces as the satellite passes overhead, and the anti-submarine warfare officers are notified in just minutes, empowering them to respond in a way that we've never seen before. As you can tell, we're really excited about Palantir's Metaconstellation, and see it as the software that brings hundreds of satellites to bear on your hardest problems. Whether it's the anti-submarine warfare officer that I just described using it to find submarines or first responders, leveraging AI to spot wild fire signs. Metaconstellation is there to empower users. Thank you, Shannon. Cutting edge product and continued efficiencies and distribution drove exceptionally strong year-over-year Q2 results. Total revenue grew 49% in Q2. U.S. commercial revenue accelerated to 90%, second quarter TCV book rose 175% year-over-year to 925 million. We added 20 net new customers in Q2 alone while generating 7.9 million of average revenue per customer. The average revenue of the top 20 customers grew sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, from 36 million to 39 million. The number of commercial customers grew 32% over last quarter. We closed 62 deals of a million dollars and more, 30 of which were for 5 million or more, and 21 were for 10 million or more. For the first half, we grew revenue 49%, we generated 28% adjusted free cash flow, and a 33% adjusted operating margin. And visibility into future growth is strong, as total deal value increased 63% to 3.4 billion. Product innovation is that the core of these results and the momentum that's driving our business forward. You just saw how innovations on edge AI delivered through Apollo are transforming the capabilities of our customers. We recently completed a number of crucial firsts for this technology, including running on board advanced military helicopters and special operations fastboats. And just last week, our edge AI was inferencing from space 484 kilometers above our heads truly from space to mud. Now Apollo, our third platform has always been our secret advantage. It enables us to take our SaaS offering to where no SaaS has gone before. Drone, sub satellites, classified networks, and on-premises without losing the efficiencies and the scalability of essentially managed SaaS solution. We've been able to meet our customers where they are. And now we're going to help our customers meet their customers where they are by commercializing Apollo itself. We are hearing from established software companies that have these large install bases of on-prem customers, but they're investing all their future R&D in cloud-only solutions. They have a problem. A big one. We're a core part of their key large enterprises and government customers. They're not going to upgrade to the cloud. They require on-prem deployments. At one Fortune 500 prospect alone, we've identified a quarter to a half billion dollars with upsells that they're going to have to forego because the latest and greatest that they've developed only works in the cloud. And these specific customers require it to work on premises. This company can leverage our years of R&D in Apollo to enable their existing cloud-based SaaS software to run where the customer needs it with minimal effort, leveraging the same DevOps and SRE teams who run all of their cloud-native offerings to run this as well. Apollo makes running on-prem feel like running in the cloud. We expect to start to do a lot more here as the sheer expanse of the last 15 years of R&D investments that sought to see around corners start to become commercialized. We continue to see distributional efficiencies coupled with accelerating product innovation for established companies as well. For instance, one of the largest banks in Europe came to us with an urgent compliance challenge facing its retail banking arm. The bank has over 10,000 branches and needed to move quickly to match new regulatory requirements and optimize anti-money laundering and compliance processes. In just two days, we were able to deploy an entire solution for this customer, leveraging our out-of-the-box functionality built in Foundry. A timeline previously unthinkable in the eyes of the customer, and frankly, it would have been unthinkable to us even three years ago, where an equivalent project might have taken three months. This is only possible because of our product. Innovations from software to find data integration are driving the marginal cost of data integration to zero, archetypes, and our no-code technologies, they're driving the marginal cost of application development to zero. All of this allows our customers to focus on solving the ever-evolving problem at hand from the outset instead of wasting time wrangling legacy systems for months or years on end. It is exciting to see our technology being tasked with increasingly complex operational challenges and to see it deliver compounding wins for these customers in these scenarios. In mining, Foundry is deployed at one of Rio Tinto's state-of-the-art underground mining operations. An asset made up of five separate mine shafts comprising 200 kilometers of tunnels and reaching a maximum deck of 1.3 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Rio is using Foundry to build a digital mine to keep its employees safe and streamlined operations. Sensor data will allow Rio to have pinpoint precision to monitor equipment performance to measure geotechnical conditions and ensure the safety of its people underground. And it can do all of this from thousands of miles away in its Brisbane hub where caving experts are able to assist operations in the field. In energy, we are pioneering more ways to empower operational users to drive strategic outcomes. Our no-code technology is extending to real-time sensor data enabling the front line to easily create and manage their own multi-source sensor fusion at the speed of their operations. This is the shortest path from data to decision. Real-time, high consequence, high-skill environments. Whether it's edge AI or edge application, we are at the extreme edge. Our momentum and utilities continues to accelerate where the Foundry platform has a unique fit and is delivering scaled value in weeks. In Q1, we announced our partnership with NG and PG&E. In Q2, we added two more utilities, National Grid and Southern California Edison, where we are creating a connected utility from PSPS that's public safety power shut off to procurement to grid management and safety. More broadly, what we've really proven are the last few quarters. And that's really reflected in the tremendous growth of the commercial customer count, 32% growth in Q2, is that Foundry is for everyone. The market is changing. I've talked about how COVID really showed where the emperor had no clothes. It isn't just the big established companies that took notice of his bare assets. The young guns did too. And these young guns, they see Foundry as an alternative to building bespoke solutions in AWS or Azure or any other cloud. They need software today that is ready for any tomorrow. Our software is that enabling platform and a growing number of companies from early stage to newly public companies, they're pursuing that vision on Foundry. We refer to these organizations as day zero companies. The innovation in our distribution is enabling us to partner with these organizations across many industries as they build their offerings on Foundry. For example, in Biotech, Cellularity is leveraging our experience in both Pharma R&D and manufacturing to accelerate drug development and set a new standard for cell-based therapies. Royman is drawing on the work that we've done spanning pharma companies like Sinofi and Merck Group and public health platforms like M3C Unite to pool and share trial data with development partners and build out real-world evidence capabilities to support key disease areas. In automotive, WeJo is building a SaaS ecosystem for connected vehicle data spanning use cases across OEM, suppliers, insurers, and government authorities on top of Foundry. In logistics, Box is building a digital twin incorporating gold shipment and sales operations spanning raw materials all the way through to end customers. And just so much more, we are making Foundry accessible to even more day zero companies with Foundry for Builders, a program which supports early stage companies with access to Foundry, allowing these companies to build their operations on Foundry from the outset, enabling them not just to efficiently manage but actually to wield the increase in complexity of their growing businesses to disrupt incumbents and to win in the marketplace. And while competitors are bogged down by legacy IT investments and in obsession with reinventing every wheel internally, these companies have no IT counterlogm. They are just Founders, entrepreneurs and engineers focused on winning and they see Foundry as the best way to do that. This program includes companies like Chapter, who is revolutionizing the consumer experience in Medicare plan selection enrollment or Gecko Robotics is building badass robots for industrial inspections and origin materials which is helping companies decarbonize their supply chains to achieve net zero and really net negative carbon footprints. And we plan to extend this offering to more early stage companies in a variety of industries over time. We need to be substantial opportunity to grow our business and push the ambition of our product with these days or companies and we couldn't be more excited to power the next generation of builders. And this innovation is all happening in the context of ongoing investment and business strength. We continue to invest in distribution across the business. We added more than 60 hires into our sales function in the second quarter, surpassing 100 hires for the first half of the year and the pipeline is accelerating. Active commercial pilots increase 26% just since the end of April. We added 20 net new customers in the second quarter alone. Our commercial customer count grew 32% in Q2 and we booked just over $900 million total contract value in the second quarter, providing substantial visibility into our future growth. In our government business, we continue to see a broadening scope of opportunities and expansion of work that we're doing across defense, healthcare and other critical initiatives. We signed new deals with the US Army Air Force and Coast Guard, including a two year, $100 million deal with US Special Operations Command. We participated in the US Northern Command's third global information dominance experiment in July, where our software is driving applied AI decision making for real world scenarios, revolutionizing North Com's ability to wield data to outpace adversaries. In healthcare, we signed new deals in the US with HHS and the CDC. In July, we announced the doubling of our contract for the Tiberius platform, which the US government uses to track vaccine production, distribution and administration. These wins, they reflect our expanding reach in both combating the pandemic and driving innovation across the healthcare landscape. Our work in government continues to expand beyond defense and healthcare. In Q2, the FAA selected pounder had provided the software backbone that will support aircraft certification and operational safety activities. The FAA will deploy foundry to conduct critical tasks, including the ongoing monitoring of the 737 MAX fleets return to service. This continues palatures thriving aerospace business with our deep partnership with Airbus and our work with airlines through SkyWise. We continue to develop our channel partnerships as well. In June, we announced a new partnership with Data Robot, focused on helping customers with demand forecasting. COVID disruptions have made a fool of all the old ways in managing these forecasts and created a huge amount of urgency to transform. By leveraging Data Robot's model development and foundry's best in class to offer defined data integration, ontology and operational applications and workflows, brands can employ agile strategies for demand forecasting that can be deployed in minutes instead of months. We continue to build our relationship with global size. Our work with Accenture Federal has really taken on. We're working across agencies from Intel Defense in civilian. McCenture is investing in scaling this momentum across all of their market units. As a cultural note, we were very excited to hold our annual hack week last week back in our offices. Hack Week has a storied and lively pounder tradition dating back to our earliest days. Hack Week is so demonstrative of our culture of innovation, one that puts the very best people next to the problems that matter. The problems that define our time and empowers each and every one of them to tell the man who yes is often me to f off. Some of our most innovative ideas and core technologies came out of Hack Week's past, including the precursor to Apollo. And that's the interesting thing. The big ideas aren't always on the road map, that term of false comfort and polished lies that big tech companies provide us market texture. Note, the big ideas, they come out of inspiration and perspiration and I am keenly aware as management at the very best ideas and most profound ideas. They start as heresy as heterodoxies that a hierarchical structure will snuff out. We at Palantir were an artist colony, extraordinarily and exquisitely flat. And that is kept alive by organizing and reorganizing around our customers problems, often with great volatility, not by gazing at our navels or calcifying roadmaps. We do the hard thing and the brave thing because that's the right thing for our customers. So I just want to celebrate the hobbits who crushed Hack Week's present and past. Long live the fellowship. Now I'll turn it over to Dave to talk through the financials. Thanks, Sean. All review our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook. We had a record breaking Q2 as continued product innovation and our ongoing investments in distribution to a strong financial performance as de-electivity accelerated in the second quarter. We generated year-over-year revenue growth of 49% for the quarter and for the first half bringing Q2 revenue to 376 million and first half revenue to 717 million. We generated 50 million in adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter, bringing our adjusted free cash flow for the first half of the year, about 200 million, a free cash flow margin of 28% in the first half, which was a $433 million improvement year-over-year. We had a strong first half and have increasing visibility for the second half of the year, as reflected by our raised, full year adjusted free cash flow guidance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased to 117 million, representing margin of 31% or third straight quarter with adjusted operating margins above 30%. Current quarter total contract value bookings grew 175% year-over-year to 925 million, providing increased visibility for a durable long-term growth, while second quarter billings increased 40% year-over-year to 379 million. We added 20 net new customers in the quarter, 13% quarter-over-quarter sequential growth for our customer count. Our commercial customer count grew 32% quarter-over-quarter sequentially. Drilling down into our second quarter revenue, revenue growth was 49%. Ahead of a prior guidance of 43%. We continued to see strength across our US business, which grew 60% year-over-year in Q2. Looking at revenue by segment, second quarter-government revenue was 232 million, up 66% year-over-year. The strength in our government business was driven by new deals with the US Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, HHS, CDC, as well as milestone revenue for an international government customer. We continued to build a strong pipeline of opportunities within our government segment, and we expect these deals to drive sustained, elevated growth in our government business moving forward. Second quarter commercial revenue growth accelerated to 144 million, up 28% year-over-year, compared with 19% growth in the first quarter. Speed and innovation are driving strong results in our commercial business, particularly in the US where commercial revenue growth accelerated to 90% year-over-year in Q2, up from 72% in Q1. We are also seeing growth in our international business as economies have broad continued re-open. In the second quarter, we closed 62 deals of a million or more in total contract value. We closed 30 deals of 5 million or more, including 21 deals or 10 million or more. Total contract value booked in the second quarter grew 175% year-over-year to 925 million. We ended the second quarter with total remaining deal value of 3.4 billion, up 63% year-over-year, while commercial deal value was up 122% year-over-year to 2.1 billion. Average contract duration was 3.9 years, up from 3.7 years at the end of Q1. Second quarter trailing 12-month revenue per customer was 7.9 million, up 19% year-over-year, and downmodestly from Q1, a result of rapid customer acquisition that yielded 20 net-new customers in the quarter. As we noted on our first quarter call, as new customer additions accelerate driven by growth in our sales team and channel partners and onboarding of new innovative day-zero companies, we would expect average revenue per customer to taper, reflecting our broadening customer base. When excluding the impact of new customers added in Q2, average revenue per customer was 8.8 million, up 9% compared with Q1. This trailing 12-month revenue per top 20 customers was 39 million, up 36% year-over-year. Next, I'll discuss our margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 82%, up 200 basis points versus the year-ago period. Contribution margin was 58%, up 300 basis points versus the year-ago period. Second quarter income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was 117 million, representing a margin of 31%. Adjusted expenses were 259 million, up 16% year-over-year, and reflect our ongoing scaling across the business, including both product development and sales to support durable, long-term growth. We hired more than 100 sales people in the first half of the year and expect hiring to continue at a strong clip in the second half of 2021. Marketing spent nearly doubled in Q2 compared with Q1, as we continue to build out both brand and performance marketing to drive both sales and recruiting funnels. In the second quarter, we generated 50 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 13%, and adjusted free cash flow exceeded 200 million in the first half of 2021. Given our strong cash flow position, we repaid our outstanding $200 million turn loan facility and our currently debt-free. After paying off the debt, we ended the quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. With our balance sheet and a strengthening cash flow profile, we plan to continue to invest in both product innovation and broadening distribution, as well as partnering with day zero companies to help them rapidly scale their businesses while leveraging our software platforms. In the first half of the year, we committed to invest 250 million, and we funded approximately 20 million of those commitments today. We have and expect to continue to make additional strategic investments in the future. In the second quarter, 3 million, or less than 1% of our quarterly revenue, was from companies we invested in as part of this strategic investment program we launched earlier this year. Turning to our outlook for our Q3 revenue guidance, we expect revenue of 385 million, and we expect adjusted operating margin of 22% for the quarter. On the back of our strong first half, adjusted free cash flow performance, and continuing momentum in the second half of the year, we are raising full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to an excess of 300 million. Continuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO Alex Carp in our year end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide guidance of greater than 30% revenue growth for this year and the next four years at each earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rodney to open up Q&A.
