TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Are our allies in the West, in Europe, are going to have to learn from us? Are allies in the Middle East are learning quicker from us? Are adversaries are trying to learn from us? And we're not, you can't look at this as an vacuum. One of the biggest mistakes that people are making is, you know, people become economically literate. So you wouldn't write an article saying you could just buy a borrow money endlessly. But you could write an article that's just as stupid on technology and tech gets to say here, and America has every advantage in this field, like every advantage, every company you'd want to buy from, not just us, others, great companies, every company you'd want to sell to, every company that's selling to customers that's flexible and adopt. We get the best people. You have to focus on that and anything slowing us down is just essentially a transfer of IP to adversaries. But you just call it a dangerous. You will pay a huge price for that.
