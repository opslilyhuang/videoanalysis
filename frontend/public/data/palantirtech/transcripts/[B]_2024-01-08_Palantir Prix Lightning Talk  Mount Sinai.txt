TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for inviting me to speak on some of the very exciting work that we are doing with Palantir. I am Carly Gustasson. I'm the deputy COO for Inter-System Clinical Operations and in my role I oversee our clinical command center and our clinical command center has actually been designed to serve as the operational backbone of our health system to deliver innovative care models to our patients across campuses and we use our clinical command center to make sure that our patients get the right care at the right time with the right resources every single time. And when we designed our clinical command center we thought of it in three generations and the first one was to improve patient flow and throughput across the organization. The second was to improve clinical safety and quality and then the third was to make sure that we could actually deliver the resources that we deliver in the hospitals in our communities so that our patients actually had other options. And in order to maximize our efforts we really knew that we needed to underpin this with technology to really be able to serve as a foundation for all this work and what I like to say is to dig up all of that little needle in a haystack information that we need in real time in order to be able to do process improvement in real time. And this is where our partnership with Palantir began. And so we went from data ingestion to go live with our first pilot in a little over four months. Our initial area of focus was really to be able to pull forward clinical criteria of emergency department patients who met guidelines to be able to be treated for their admission episode of care in our hospital at home or at another campus where there was a bed readily available to be able to go ahead and continue their ongoing treatment so that they weren't just sitting in an overcrowded emergency department. And just to give you a little bit of background, our teams used to go ahead and search this patient criteria in the mornings every single day only to identify these patients at peak times when our operations in the ED were surging. And so now we're trying to take care of all those new patients as well as move these patients to other levels of care and you can imagine that's the perfect collide. And so what we were actually able to do was we said okay listen if we can get a hold of these patients right away and reduce their time in the ED will actually reduce their time on the back end of their length of stay. And that's absolutely what we found. So for all of these eligible patients that could continue their care and treatment elsewhere we were able to shave 1.5 days off of their length of stay. And just to give you an idea of what that means for the hospital we added 20 beds back on average every single month into the hospital without building any net new beds. And right now we're tracking an annualized ROI of 1.5 million dollars and just to give you a sense that's one department one small test of change in one hospital. So we're looking forward over the next couple of weeks to actually scale this work across the Mount Sinai Health System. And we're very confident that our results will follow. Our next steps with Palantir are to focus on some of our most vulnerable patient groups. So patients who have sepsis we want to make sure that those patients are staying on the sepsis care pathway to get them back on their feet out of the hospital quickly. We're going to focus on some operational efficiencies in our pharmacy, our ancillary testing areas. And we were very excited about the future because truly I think our use cases are endless. I know my time is up but I just have to thank the incredible group of engineers. I'm not going to name all of their names because they're fabulous and there are. So I don't want to give anybody any ideas. And then obviously the wonderful clinicians at the Mount Sinai Health System who we've just created this perfect partnership. This is the work that will forever change the care of our patients. This is the work that matters. And we're just so excited to be part of this. Thank you so much.
