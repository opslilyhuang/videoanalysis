TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi, I'm Chad Walkwist. I'm an architect at Palantir. I get questions all the time about work speed. I want to know more about it. I want to see some demos of it. So today, I've got Meredith, who's driving a lot of the work speed work. Thanks for joining me Meredith. Hi Chad, thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here. Yeah. So maybe just before we get into kind of the demo and showing people stuff, give us a little bit of info about yourself, how long you've been up Palantir? Totally. I've been up Palantir for eight years now. I can't believe it. It kind of feels like only two years. Time flies at Palantir. And I lead our work speed team and I'm based in the New York office. Awesome. Okay. So we're talking about work speed, work speed, work speed. And it's very kind of ambiguous to people. We hear Sean talk about it on the quarterly earnings. We've got some new website launches, but it's still hard for people to grasp what it is. It's a bigger umbrella, right? Maybe we can hear your description about what is work speed. Totally. I often joke that work speed is a state of mind, which maybe isn't the most helpful. And we can explain some of it more in a demo in a minute. But it's really our customers who are committed to doing an ambitious overhaul of their business and how they run it. And so it's really building out a new operating system for these defense industrial-based manufacturers so that they can adapt to some of the newer challenges that we're seeing out there today. Yeah. So like we talk about an operating system for manufacturing, there's a lot of different pieces and components. I think the one that's probably most far along that we talk about in C's is something called Merp Speed. Maybe where does Merp Speed fit in? I know we'll show some of it in the demo, but from your perspective, who's using Merp Speed? What are they doing with it? Merp Speed is our MRP offering. It's mostly being used by supply planners and folks on the maybe supply chain side of a business. But what's really cool about Merp Speed and all of the Merp Speed offerings is that they're all connected. And so you have Merp Speed which will generate your planned orders. Those planned orders will impact your future inventory projections. Those inventory projections are consumed by our configuration management tools that let you pick the optimal time to cut in a design change based on projected spend, projected inventory, you know, scrap cost. And all of that feeds into our manufacturing finance work that's, you know, taking all of these little decisions across the organization and dollarizing them essentially. So because we're building all of the warp speed offerings in our Foundry platform, it's really easy to kind of send information from one to the other and have them all talking to each other. That's very cool. So okay, talking about Merp Speed, but we always talk about let's not talk about it, let's show it. So maybe you can give us a preview of it. Yeah, let me pull up my screen to share here. So before I jump into a a Merp Speed demo of how to actually use all the tools here, maybe we'll do a quick Merp Speed 101 MRP 101 for those watching who might not be supply planners. So in this architecture diagram, let's start with at the bottom of the page, we kick off every warp speed project with, you know, basic Foundry data integration. This is really the bread and butter of of Palantir for many years now. That data integration leads us to our supply chain ontology. And for those who aren't familiar with an ontology, I know Chad has many videos that can be quite helpful about it, but these are representing the nouns and verbs of our warp speed customers. So we have items that are linked to a bill of materials. Those are sold via demand events. Those demand events impact your inventory. Your inventories were planished by work orders and purchase orders. Then the Merp Speed engine sits on top of this ontology. And so the MRP calculations, as mentioned, aren't that complicated? What's complicated is doing it at scale. And when we sat down to build Merp Speed, we actually in full transparency thought we were going to build just a simulation engine. And as we got deeper with our users and with our initial warp speed customers, we realized that actually most MRPs just don't work. It's a little confusing to explain, so in the weeds of why that is, but they're very slow. They have some arbitrary constraints on what you can put as an input. And they're really difficult to adjust and to tune to what the real world, you know, truth on the ground is. I think that's a key point though, that so much of this is like I have to have the ground truth of what's going on, not just some system representation. And I think that's where the foundational technology we have of integrating and bringing data together into that ontology represents the ground truth of what's going on. And then what you're saying here now, we've got an engine to calculate and optimize and simulate on top of that, right? Yes, exactly. So it's always, you know, I've been a paltier eight years. It's still shocking to me sometimes when I sit down with users and they look at, you know, their own data in their own source systems and they just know it's wrong. They look at this mill of materials and they say, that's not right. We changed it six months ago. This inventory levels wrong, you know, the supplier tells us our lead time is 90 days. I know it's actually 120. So with all of those learnings, when we built out the MerpSpeed engine, we started building in these levers. And the levers let you tune the engine so that the inputs and the outputs are reflective of either truth on the ground or a scenario where you want to understand what that truth on the ground would look like. So you can adjust inputs in the form of demand priorities, P-bomb. So now WarpSpeed customers have their M-bomb, their E-bomb, you got a P-bomb as well. Excuse me? So what is a P-bomb? Oh, yes. A P-bomb is a planning bill of materials. There is usually some inherent lag between updates on an E-bomb, which is your engineering bill of materials in your M-bomb, which is the bill of materials you manufacture. And in order to, you know, try and bridge the gap between those lags, we introduced a P-bomb so that planners now in MerpSpeed engine can come and pull an assembly or pull a child part out of a bill of materials and replace it with a new part and then run their whole plan on top of this, you know, simulated bill of materials or the real bill of materials that there's just some data-steelness issues on. That's very cool. So that allows them to really simulate what changes to try different stuff out before they make it real to go manufacture against it. Yeah. And that's something that ties in with our configuration management work, which I mentioned in the beginning, where now on the design phase of a project, you could actually come in and run MerpSpeed on an E-bomb or on, you know, a shadow bomb you just build in Foundry to see what is my cycle time going to be when do I need to think about starting to firm and release purchase orders. All of that kind of new product development is happening in the warp speed platform as well. Very cool. So you set these levers and now your MerpSpeed engine is representative of what you want it to be representative of and, you know, that maybe sounds like a freebie, but that in itself is a pretty big deal for users. Then the next thing that MerpSpeed brings to the table really is the MerpSpeed ontology. So with this, we're really trying to, you know, unbox the black box of MRPs. In a typical MRP, you might get a planned order for a million dollars of inventory and you don't have any clue what it's for. Is this for an internal test event? Is this for our most important customer? Is this for a part that shouldn't even be in the bill of materials anymore? So MerpSpeed outputs into the Foundry ontology, not just your pretty vanilla planned orders in the form of planned purchase orders and planned work orders, but it also outputs requirements, allocations and shortages so that you can have that trace ability from a demand event, which is what we call really a sales order, you know, customer places in order, all the way to the planned order and you can tie out to the inventory transaction timeline. You can see why do I have a shortage of this part on this day? Where did the last 10 units get allocated to? Why did they get allocated there? And start to really, you know, untangle the web of decisions in an MRP so that you can have confidence, but you can also override those decisions and you need to see them in order to override them. So you, it's like kind of in the AI world, like the chain of thought, but you're seeing the chain of thought about how we're coming up with these different things so that you understand it can override it can adjust levers. Instead of this black box of like, let me try something and I'll see this other outcome over here in normal MRPs, you can actually really see the inner workings, but I think that's that's really powerful. Yeah, and then the last thing we do in the ontology is we output runtime errors. A lot of MRPs, let's say there's a typo in an item number, it doesn't exist. The whole MRP run fails. And a lot of these MRP runs take, you know, 4, 8, 12 hours. You run it overnight, you come in the next morning and you realize the person sitting next to me made a fat finger error and now we don't have any refresh data for the whole day, we have to wait until tomorrow. So the way we set up MerbSpeed Engine, any time it encounters, you know, a broken node or a demand event that's not configured correctly, it throws an error on that one part and then keeps moving, which is, you know, pretty similar to how we think about data pipelines in Foundry in General is don't let one little stale data bring everything downstream, you know, into the stale world. So I just want to emphasize that, which it always breaks my heart when I see users who can't even do their job because something failed overnight. Yeah, so that malleability, the kind of the ability to like handle and manage ugly data, like I think that's a question I get all the time whether it's related to WarpSpeed or not, is, you know, can I do this when my data is not clean yet and actually, you know, we're proving right here what these examples is, it doesn't have to be perfect, you can actually using it through the system here is how you start to get it better. All right, so we've got the levers, we've got the outputs sorted. The last thing I want to talk about before showing some of the applications is how we actually branch MerpSpeed and use that to enable scenarios for supply planners. And this is kind of inspired actually by a lot of your videos and volunteers, AIP, talk track, which for those not familiar is why use one LLM when you could use N LLMs. And I feel very similarly about MRP plans, why use one MRP when you could use NMRPs. And so everything that you do in MerpSpeed can be branched into a scenario. Those scenarios run with Foundry Automation. So for example, you can have every scenario refresh every time your inventory updates, every hour, whatever you want it to be. And then you can actually toggle between all of these scenarios and all of the front end applications in MerpSpeed. So some example scenarios, MerpSpeed Max Capacity. This is where we set throughput, which is how many units you want to produce week over week. We set throughput to Max Capacity for every product line. So you are going full steam ahead, making it much as you can every single day. But we also have the opposite MerpSpeed cash preserving where you are reducing safety stock, you're moving to more of a just in time manufacturing model and trying to really conserve spend on product lines. So just real quick, so I think the important thing here to key in on is I can do this across all of my materials, but maybe for certain product lines I want to do Max throughput because I have a ton of demand and another product line is moving slower, I have different constraints. So I'm going to do it. So I can actually run these and understand and manage product lines across these different branches, right? Yes. And I think that actually is the perfect segue, maybe to show you the tool that does that. That's good. I'm going to leave our diagram. I'll jump into our command center and open our executive cockpit. So here we can see, and you know, this is all notional data, we can see for all of the product lines at this notional defense manufacturer, what is the scenario or MerpSpeed branch that they are running on, and then we get some performance metrics across the right hand side here. And this is really important because usually different product lines have really different, you know, demand cycles. They have different nuances to how they treat inventory, especially in the defense space where you have things like federal costing. You can't necessarily beg borrow and steal a valve from that program for your program. So this could be, I mean, you're talking about the government contracts could be for tariffs too, where I'm trying to manage the tariffs. You can have an optimization to adjust for when tariffs are coming in on certain raw materials you need or your products. So I think this is beyond just the government contract inside. It's like whenever these events out of my control are happening, I need to optimize maybe for specific product lines or different components for a different outcome, a different goal, right? Yeah. So this EVionics North product line is running on MerpSpeed Grace 1, which could be configured for tariffs, and you could go in with levers and set your raw material cost to be higher. You could add a import tax on top of that. You could say I want to increase the lead time for every raw material that's sourced overseas. So again, you really can tap into the core supply chain ontology in Foundry to then pull some of this information into MerpSpeed. Very cool. So for today, I'm going to put on my supply planner hat for the demo. And let's take a look at some of the suggested actions that MerpSpeed is serving up for me. And we're going to look at our engine product line today, our engine models A1, A2, and A3. And MerpSpeed is telling me that we are anticipating closing a large contract for 28 more units with a tight ship date. And because of that signal coming maybe from our demand planning team or our sales team, it's recommending that we move to MerpSpeed Max to try and get a little bit of an inventory built up of our finished products with the anticipation of more demand coming in. So that sounds reasonable to me. I'll go ahead and accept that change. And now my engine model A1, A2, A3 is running on MerpSpeed Max. Since I'm already thinking on the strategic steering level, let's talk about levers really quickly. So MerpSpeed is going to suggest to us that we're going to add some buffers into these three materials it looks like here that have delays coming through for our product line. So I'm going to go ahead and apply that change as well. And now that I have made those edits to my levers, again, I'm actually just making them on my MerpSpeed Max branch. So at any point I could undo these very easily, but they're also not impacting any one else's scenario on other branches. So if the product line next to me is running on MerpSpeed cash preserving, they're not going to get my safety stock reduction or my lead time buffers unless they choose to merge those changes into their plan as well. That's cool. So like I love the taking the kind of the core software development primitives around branching and merging. You're branching an entire business and being able to merge and allow people to work in parallel on things, simulate them out, understand the impact before you actually make the change. I think that's like very real and powerful. Totally. And let me show you maybe what that branching comparison looks like. So I'm going to open up my scenario manager. And we'll just see here some of the out of the box MerpSpeed scenarios. This list gets a lot longer once we deploy MerpSpeed for real. But these are kind of just forward to get anyone started. And I want to compare my MerpSpeed optimized with my MerpSpeed Max scenario. And I could you know click between them one at a time and try to better understand how is my OTIF and what does my cost look like. But it's a little bit easier to do that side by side. So I can see on the left hand side here for MerpSpeed optimized, my OTIF is 90%. So that's actually really good. My safety stock cost is a little bit high. And my safety stock level is looking good. Then we also pull these metrics down to a user level. So because I am responsible for the engine product line, I really want to make sure that the changes I'm making are good for the engine product line and not you know bad for other product lines. But especially not bad for my product line. So when I think about just the engine model side of the world, moving to max actually is a huge win for us. Our OTIF is moving from 72 to 95%. Our cost is going up, but it's not totally ballooning the way it is globally. And our you know total violations here is going down. So a violation is any little blip in your plan that is going to lead to a delay. So if a single item is a single day late, you collect a violation. So I like the concept too because like managing by exception rather than trying to manage everything allows people to really like become experts and focus on what they're really good at. Instead of trying to manage every little thing, I'm just setting the rules. I'm encoding my logic and then I'm managing the exceptions. I think that's the other key to that scaling pieces. Now I can manage to exception and I can branch and merge and try different things like you're doing in comparing. I think like you start to combine all these things together and I start to see the power of it. Yep exactly. So now that we have compared the output and you know I feel pretty good about my choice for switching the model, the engine model line to MerpSpeed max. Let's get into the weeds so that I can actually do some shortage resolution. So every time a demand event or a sales order comes in, MerpSpeed traverses all of the items in that demand event. So whether it's for one engine or five engines or three of three different kinds of engines, it runs those traversals and looks at whether the demand event can be met on time. And let's start with an external purchase for engine assembly. This is coming into my Bristol location. We need seven engines and unfortunately it is going to be 238 days delayed. That's going to hurt. Yeah. Yeah. But why will it be so delayed? Is the first question I might want to ask. So we're doing the bomb traversal here. And MerpSpeed tags out every node as either a transient or a root cause delay. So this rocker arm spring is a root cause delay. That means this individual part is contributing delays to the assemblies it goes into. And when we think about again interoperability between all of the different warp speed offerings, this is where the configuration management would come in. And you might be able to see all of the different parts here that have an upcoming configuration change or parts that have been deprecated or maybe a reminder I need to go set a P bomb override for this demand event. That's cool. So I like the concept too where we're taking kind of the multimodal piece where it's not just a hierarchy of a bomb and all the materials that go into this assembly. But I actually can try to understand what's component of it. And if I'm like really trying to dig in and like, oh, it's this piece is like I think for as a human like I'm very visual as well to like to be able to see those things together. I think this is really powerful. Yes, yes. So on my home page, I've got 401 root cause items that are putting 46 demand events at risk. Similar to what we saw in demand explorer where we want to just start pulling the important stuff out of the weeds for our users, we do the same on suggested actions. We haven't talked about yet expedite even purchase orders. So oftentimes, you know, you could you could pay a fee to get something faster, right? If you're buying something online, next day shipping, usually more expensive. But from a max perspective, it might be worth paying some of those expedite fees so that we can really start to get the production lines running. Yeah, I mean, it comes back to kind of like the end goal is the single piece flow across manufacturing and you're able to get to that root cause faster. But the thing is you find one root cause there's the next one. And so what I'm seeing here is that iterative approach of okay, fix root cause. What's the next one? What's the next one? That's the next one. Which I think is like super powerful, but it's hard because normally in an MRP, you go fix one root cause now. You got to wait for things to shift rerun MRP the next day. Hopefully you didn't have a data problem. And then you could look at it again. But what I'm seeing here is the speed is I can make those changes rerun things. And then what's the next bottleneck, right? I think that is so underestimated and like so, but so powerful to be able to move quickly like that. I'll notice that on some of my expedited POs, we've got a little action required going on. This could be because they're, let's see, it's telling me there's an oversight and the vendor's capacity constraints. So we need to go check in with the vendor before we try and get this product any faster. You could also have, you know, human decision makers as gates on these. So maybe if my purchase order is less than 50k, I can just place it automatically. If it's one of my more expensive items, I might want to either, you know, stop and manually approve that or maybe my supervisor needs to approve it. Once we are happy with some of these actions we're taking, I can at any point jump into my daily summary. You'll see over the course of this demo, we have been busy busy expediting. We've been reworking. If I scroll all the way down, you'll see we even actually switched our whole product strategy at the very beginning. And we just tally up the cost of all of these decisions. So that ties into our manufacturing finance work. And then something that we see often is actually setting, you know, a month over a month or quarterly budget for supply planers so that they can track not just am I on time with demand events, am I getting all of the throughput that I want, but is my spend in line with expectations as well. Yeah, I think it's probably for anyone that hasn't worked in that space, realizing tying together finance, procurement, manufacturing, planning all into one place, like that is very, very difficult. And to do it where I can rerun an MRP in a few minutes, like that is game changer. Yep. The very last thing I might do as a supply planner is movement to my planning workbench where I could actually, you know, firm some of these planned purchase orders and planned work orders. And that's where some of the maybe core warp speed beliefs here come in that we're not trying to replace any system that does its job really well. So an ERP is really good at the transaction layer. It's really good for finance. We just have MerpSpeed sit on top of your ERP. So when I have a purchase order that needs to be approved, I'm just writing that purchase order from Foundry to your ERP where it actually is transacted with a supplier. So that kind of read right relationship with existing systems allows us to really just, you know, pick and choose what we should work on. We're not trying to reinvent any wheels, but we have the flexibility and the agility to fill all of these gaps in existing systems. Well, in a lot of times you're lucky if you have one ERP, right? A lot of times there's many. And so I think it's like, how do I combine the many different ERPs or ecosystems and tools? But the other thing is like, if I want really the end goal is speed to value. Like, how do I do this? Do I want to re-implement another ERP? I think everyone's response isn't going to be no, but leveraging what you have by having this bi-directional connectivity to write back to the kind of the base transaction, leave the core core, build all the optimizations here across all the systems. That fundamental primitive of how we build, I think, is really powerful. This is why we can start to execute in days and weeks, not months and years. That's right. In the MerpSpeed team, we set out right after Labor Day to build, again, originally, a simulation engine. We wound up just fully building an MRP engine. All of the applications that we just saw today, plus some that we actually haven't moved to a notional stack yet, in the MerpSpeed engine when live before Christmas. So we got the whole thing done in about three months, which even for Palantir is pretty dang fast. Well, thank you for showing us. I think this is going to be eye-opening for a lot of people, and I'm sure every supply planner or people work at it, or even are like, I want. And so this is really cool to see behind the curtain and show the whole world. WarpSpeed and specifically, more MerpSpeed here. Yeah, it's been fun. I'm always happy to give a MerpSpeed demo, and you know, we've been heads down working on it pretty hard for the last few months. So it's nice to come up for air and show it off a little bit. Awesome. Well, thanks for your time today.
