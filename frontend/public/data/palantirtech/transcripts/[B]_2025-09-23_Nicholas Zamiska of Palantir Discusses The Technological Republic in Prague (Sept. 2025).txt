TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'll be really having a full industrial revolution in our hands. What do you think? Well, it is the question of the moment. I do think LLMs represent a completely discontinuous and remarkable advance in the form of artificial intelligence as we know it. They are, in some ways they appear magical, but they also require something else. And that's a foundational data architecture to make them useful. You know, I think one good example I came across an airline maintenance workflow. If you're trying to maintain a fleet of airplanes and you need to replace a part and you need to think about who's qualified to replace that particular part on those particular aircraft with regard to planes flying around a country, a national airline, for example. You need the schedule information. You need the part information. You need to think about where the parts coming from, whether it's backlog, maybe what the cost is, what truck it's on. Then you have to think about the technicians. Are they qualified to work on that particular part? Now, also, I saw this wrinkle in this actual workflow. What about have they taken vacation recently? So, all of a sudden, you have the LLM, which now you can ask common-sense plain language questions of, you know, what engineers are most qualified to work on this part at this time and in a way that might not disrupt schedules. Yet, for the LLM to do anything remotely useful with that query, you need to point it to specific data sets that are the most reliable canonical data sets that the company has. What is the latest schedule, vacation information? Who's taken vacation days? Where is the latest certification information for those engineers? What parts are we talking about? What parts matter most? What parts are most likely to disrupt the operations of my airline? And all of a sudden, you have, I think, a good example of the ways in which LLMs, when married with the foundational infrastructure that we have built over the course of two decades, can really do something useful. How does the West compare to a country like China, for example? Like, if we look at it as an arms race, are we ahead? Is it next to next? What do you think? You know, I think we have enormous advantages. You know, we shouldn't take them for granted, but there are real advantages. You know, we looked at the top 50 technology companies on the planet. 86% of that market cap, as of, you know, last year or so, was in the United States. That's essentially $9 out of every 10 of big tech market cap coming from the US. Why is that? You know, that's a long conversation. I think there are a lot of reasons that drive that, but we also have challenges. You know, one example that comes to mind is the F-35 joint strike fighter. This is the premier, you know, the premier fighter jet of the age, conceived of under President Clinton in the mid-1990s in the United States. And Mark Milley reminded us relatively recently. You know, this jet, this single product, costs $2 trillion with a T trillion. And its end of useful life is 2088. You know, and Milley made the great point. What do we think are the odds that a manned fighter jet is going to be winning the skies in 2088? You know, I think you and I know the answer to that question. It's going to be drones. Absolutely. And yet there's this century-long product development cycle. You know, at Palantir, this is foreign. Foreign doesn't even do it. Just as alien. You know, we try to iterate not in a century, 50 years, you know, 20 years, two years. We try to iterate with our software in two months, two weeks. Sometimes even two days, you know. So how can we get those product development cycles down? Hardware, you know, hardware is different, yes. But that, I think, is not necessarily- that approach will not necessarily guarantee us the dominance that the U.S. and our allies in Europe, including the Czech Republic and elsewhere, enjoyed in the 20th century to ensure that level of dominance in the 21st we need to pivot and very briskly. The only thing I'll add to that is that, you know, the spending on software, we have a horse in the race. So take what I say with a grain of salt. But it needs to increase. As of, you know, a year or two ago, the U.S. has a roughly $900 billion defense budget, probably edging towards a trillion a year now. 0.2% of that was spent on AI, not 5%, but a fifth of 1%. Yes, it's crept up, it's moving in the right direction, but the steel, the planes and tanks that really, you know, won the last century will not be what wins the next. And I think the countries that pivot and pivot most briskly can play an outsize role, whether it's a poll in the Czech Republic and Argentina, you know, some middleweight players I think could be really formidable leaders in this next century in a way that we probably wouldn't have expected even a few years ago if they invest in what really matters and moves the needle. You know, fundamentalists, Russian, where liberals fear to tread that this liberal tendency is to be very, very wary when it comes to national interest and collective identity. And I think a lot of people, you know, if they heard it, it would make them feel quite nervous, yet you feel it is something that we've lost and that we perhaps need to get back somehow. What would you, how would you respond to these people? This is something where I think you and I are, you know, quite aligned about, in fundamentalists, it's fundamentalists on the left and the right, religious and otherwise Russian, where liberals small elf fear to tread, I would say. You know, our reticence of constructing or reinforcing or supporting some growth of a national consciousness or national identity or even collective identity has had costs. You know, inclusion is an uncontroversially necessary good. You know, no one is going to argue that. But I think in the United States and the West more broadly, we forgot to ask inclusion into what? What is the whole into which we aspire to include someone else? We became so reticent to define that boundary emotionally, almost, that we favored kind of a vacant and neutered pluralism at the expense of something rich and compelling. So I think we can marry those twin goals of inclusion, but also having a robust sense of what values we want to defend. In the book, we leave that open, but that's the next stage of this discussion. I also think that the proponents of that, what I would describe as sort of that vacant neutrality fail to realize that in the absence of our, our interest in defending the collective, the market will decide, the market will rush into your question, the market will decide what ought to be built. And do we want to kneel at the altar of the market? You know, should we not have a say in whether our best and brightest minds and possibly more importantly, the money that chases them, what they're building, what is their best use of their talents working on the next social media video sharing thing? You know, I think we could all agree no. The market will speak where we fail to speak. The other thing I'll mention is with that lack of discussion about what we ought to be building and why you have, you know, a generation of very talented people drift into a small subset of industries, a recent class at Harvard, you know, 41% of these students are going into one of two industries, financing, consulting. Yes, these are vital industries. We need this. We need these sectors. This is up from 7% in the 1970s. So 7% to the 40%, essentially half the class doing one of two things. Is that the best sort of allocation of our shared resources? We would argue no. So what drove that change? And perhaps can you say a little bit more about Rick O'Villard or perhaps other such examples? Absolutely. The story of Heiming Rick over I think, and there are many stories like his, but his story is particularly resonant. He was a very senior commander in the US Navy. Former President Jimmy Carter actually served underneath him and he was this kind of a rassable guy. Problematic, I think most of us would describe him as essentially abusive in, you know, the modern parlance. He would make junior officers stand in the closet. He would say, he would burn the Navy rulebook. And he really lashed out. You know, some degree of self-awareness as well was combined with that difficulty, interpersonal difficulty. In a 1984 interview with Diane Sawyer, he had this great line. He said, you know, I know I have the charisma of a chipmunk. And yet, Admiral Rickover, by all accounts, was the father of the American nuclear Navy. He took up in Heimers invention, which came to us, you know, from the 30s and 40s, the nuclear reactor, and shrunk it. You know, made this thing smaller. So it could fit on a submarine. They actually tested it in Idaho, the smaller version of it. It worked. And they put it on a sub. And now you have a sub that can stay submerged, not for, you know, days, but weeks and months, and provided the US and its allies with an enormous advantage over the Soviets for decades, and now certainly half a century and more, an advantage that persists to this day. You know, the story continues, though, because Rickover, even though by all accounts, he was, you know, gave us the nuclear Navy and really ensured American and allied dominance over the oceans for the 20th century. You know, he had some enemies and it turns out in the early 1980s, it emerged, reported in the New York Times, and you know, the whole sort of front page treatment, that he had been accepting gifts from general dynamics, which was, you know, the premier shipbuilder of the age. And the roster of gifts was kind of odd. It was, you know, cutlery and mugs and, you know, dry cleaning for his suits, and, and yes, there was a necklace for his wife. So kind of this odd mixed grab bag of items, but amounted to real dollars over the course of a dozen plus years. And this was really used by his enemies as his fall from grace. And in the book, and I, you know, just to emphasize it here, I do think that the story is a cautionary tale for our culture, you know, what incentives do we create for our leaders? How risk averse do we want them to be? Is there no room for forgiveness, or for some tolerance of, you know, the contradictions of the human mind and our imperfections? We're all flawed creatures. And I can say that every day of the week, I would take a nuclear submarine and half a century of dominance over the Soviets. And I would give him a pass on his, yes, his vanity, his error and judgment. But I do not want to incentivize the next generation of leaders to be so risk averse. We want them to do the right thing, but we have this illusion in the US, certainly, in Europe as well, that our leaders should be our priests, but results also need to matter.
