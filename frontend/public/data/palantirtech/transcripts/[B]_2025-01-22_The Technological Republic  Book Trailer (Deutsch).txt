TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The West must defend itself. The best the people producing this thing called software must be aligned with our government. We should not allow institutions, software institutions to sell to our adversaries but not sell to the US government. The world will become disjointed and more violent. An entire generation of extraordinarily talented engineer in Silicon Valley will not hesitate to dedicate their working lives to building online shopping algorithms. The consumer apps on our phone. But when a US Marine asks for a better software system, they hesitate. So much talent, so much funding in the valley has rushed toward the consumer. At the expense of what we would argue are more significant projects from national defense to local law enforcement, health care education. The question is where do we want the resources of our country and our civilization to go? The way you dominate the future is you dominate the present. I want America to be American in a thousand years. You know the book addict's core is a call for us to reassess the value of concepts of national identity, of a shared culture, which will be essential for this country to remain as dominant in this century as it was in the last. It was a culture that absolutely won the last World War and it will be a culture that either wins or prevents the next one. There is basically no conflict in the world that where Western allies are involved and the battlefield is involved and the stakes are life and death where Palantir is not the first call.
