TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

They're very obedient. I just like we have all these new people. That's why they're so quiet. I was here 10 years ago. This looks bigger. Yeah. Are you guys filming? Yeah. So, well, Stan's going to ask the question, but I should say from the outset, Stan has been, I think, was one of our earliest investors. Came here 10 years ago at our old office and gave a talk. Isn't one of the leading investors in the world. But on top of being a leading investor in the world has been a great person to talk to about lots of things, including our business is running, how it should run. And general, obviously macro and micro conditions in the world. I believe you've been a friend of the company and to me personally. And delighted to have you here. Both kind of on a 10 year anniversary of your last talk and also a day after 9-11, which played a very large role in why we built Palantir. So, thank you for coming. Thanks, Alex. I'm delighted to be here. So, I think I invested in Palantir 14 years ago. I did quite well financially, but to tell you the truth. I've never been more proud to own a company. What you guys have done and what you've achieved and what you've meant for this country and frankly for the world. It was just a company I was thrilled to play any little part I could in. And you should all be very proud of what you do and what you've achieved. And I can't wait to see what you're doing the next five years because we're really going to need you. Speaking of that, Alex, the last time I saw you on a screen, I actually saw you on a screen, of course, I saw you this summer at Sun Valley. But in the fall of 21, Alex was being interviewed by my partner, Kevin Worsh, at a Lion and Tree conference. And it was the fall of 21. And Dr. Carp gave a talk that he doesn't know when he went off the screen. The whole audience was horrified because they could not believe the darkness with which you projected that was encompassing us in the world and autocratic states and what their behavior might be. I don't know whether he had a cell phone number and he was going to invade him for years. But between that and what's been going on with the United States and China, I think who knew that probably the best US-China relations we'd see for the next 25 years were under Trump? Because what was a Cold War, I think, seems to be turning into a hot war. But anyway, you were so pressured at the time, Alex, I thought, could you give me an update on just the state of the world, is it as scary as it looks or am I missing something? Yeah, the backdrop for this was Stan called me and it was like, hey, I'm involved in some of the organizations I'd like you to speak to, you know, the investment committee and the board there about your general views of the world. I'm always a little bit resident, red isn't to go into public. I can kind of be myself mostly a pound chair and we've delivered a lot of value for clients and partners, so it's kind of pretty okay with me being me. But this was a group of people who have normal jobs and are doing very important things. And I asked you before the call, it's like, well, what dosage can I give them? Like, can the dosage be, you know, it is like, no, you know, this day, I was like, oh no, no, they can take the full dosage, so I gave them 50%. And they still want to say the shock. The mic dropped somewhere around, there's going to be worse and inflation and disjunction and now it's part of it. I think there's a discount honestly on this because our products are built for a world of disunity, disharmony, this whole concept of having vertical and horizontal integration. Exactly is built for a world where legitimacy declines and you have micro-legitimacies and you have your supply chain isn't going to be your supply chain anymore because one day you're going to have it in this country and the next day I'm in another country, you're going to have to approve. So I felt like I could give them a higher dosage because they would discount it because it looked like, well, that's the world where pound here we do well. And in fact, we did build a company, our building a company for a world of disunity personally where I've been very focused on declining legitimacy of Western institutions and why it happens and believing that, the fact that in my view, and there's all these micro facts like why is a pound here resume so important? Well, the reason why it's so important to be a pound here is because the educational institutions we have now don't provide the same level of legitimacy they did when we went to school. And there's things that like micro decisions but basically that the decision making right or wrong, you and I probably agree it's often wrong but even if it was right it's not viewed as strengthening legitimacy in the West and then the way I've spent a lot of my time abroad and then it's misinterpreted perhaps or correctly interpret as bad decision making. So I believe the world is, we are the fact that we have vertical and horizontal integration in our products is ideally positioned because tomorrow is going to be worse than today. And I think it's going to be worse than today for pretty ephemeral reasons but it's just you have an inability for these cultures, West, non-West, to interact effectively. I think there will be an acceleration of conflict with China. You have, you have, you know, we played, we've played and played a large role in Eastern Europe but the vicissitudes of the inability to get countries to actually get to dialogue, misinterpretations of resolve, technical competence. And then, and not an ability to unify internally now all this, you know, and so I think it's going to be a rapid acceleration and one of the things that I think when we talked about this before it was jarring and shocking to people, I think now we're in a situation where no one wants to talk about how bad it could get because people are more realistic that it could get that bad. One of the gentlemen I respect the most with regard to Russian Ukraine told me, it was basically predicted everything but he told me that he thinks, I think, boring, some intervening factors, Ukraine could very well win this war next spring. Let me ask you this, does that present a scarier world, if that is going to be correct in Putin's mind, does the collapse of Russia present a scarier world even then we have right now? Well, first of all, how is Putin going to let that happen and get out of the situation alive and if he's not going to get out of it, what's he going to do? Well, one of the things that we struggle with in America and in the West is we struggle with zero some thinking. So if you look towards China and Russia, it's very hard for us to understand what the decision making would be because we basically don't do zero some decisions, especially lead institutions. And in Russia and China you have very zero some thinking, if you lose a war in Russia you will lose your life, you will not be the leader of the country after you've lost. Whereas if you go to elite schools and fail, you get your next job. And erase. So it's not part of how we see the world. Now, if we want to avoid very dangerous situation, we have to have a way to both. I like AND clauses instead of OR. So we should fight to win and we should engage in dialogue, not OR. And the fighting to win part is obviously their heroism, software and light hardware. And then what does it mean to win? What does it mean for the world? What does it mean for? I personally am not an interventionist, so I want to win but I don't really want to change Russia into a different society. I just want it to be clear that if you cross borders and cross norms that will be pushed back. There you have the problem of who's going to current conduct the dialogue in the American side. There's a lot of tricky questions. But it's like, unfortunately you usually have two factions, those that don't want to fight to win and those that want dialogue. And I think you need both. Now, Giselle and Peng decided he was going to be Putin's BFF like two weeks before Putin made what looks like a fatal error. Given the success of our intelligence there and what's going on in that war, do you think his calculus of behaving differently than he might otherwise have in his own sphere has changed or been delayed? Again, this is where it's very hard to know because the way Western institutions and even quasi-Western institutions work is you're not talking about the leader, talking about their leader conflicting interests and then a dialogue between them and the people below them. The weird thing about, I would say in the China context, at least my perspective is you're dealing with one person. It's very hard to know his calculus. But does an autocratic regime, they're meeting on Wednesday? Does he want to be identified with a loser? It's one thing being identified with another autocratic regime. It's another thing being identified with a loser. Again, I think it's nearly impossible to... If I had to make a bet in the spirit of... It was kind of reasonably right. I would... I think the decision will be to go long on being aggressive towards adversaries and not to go short on it. It's simply because it's the calculus, his own calculus. It's not the calculus of other variables. I think the calculus there is I have a short, limited amount of time to live and I'm going to push really hard. Also, it's very hard for... I spent half of my life outside of America. It's very, very hard for people to understand how the West even works. You mean from me? Yeah. You just assume that the institutions are going to fall apart. Everything is going to fall apart. The country makes no sense. How is it held together? The leadership makes no sense. It's correct. But in the middle of that, there is this weird magical thing that sometimes comes together that is nearly impossible to explain. That's why you get these crazy incredible companies in America. You get decision making that actually over a long period of time. This like pull, you know, lack of tribal nature in America that even with all the conflicts, it's still a very different environment than anywhere else in the world. You look at a Palantir. This is a company that is, you know, like everyone here apparently is new. Because like every new person wanted to come to New York. It's like this company is de facto run by people that look 12. It's like... You mean they are? It's like, yeah. How could that possibly work? So, for those of you who don't know, I make a living supposedly forecasting changes in the economic environment and in the financial markets. And with the caveat that I've been doing this 45 years and between the pandemic and the war and the crazy policy response in the United States and worldwide, this is the hardest environment I've ever encountered to try and have any confidence in a forecast six to 12 months ahead. There are brewing issues when you get the price of oil doing what is doing historically. And when you get interest rates doing what they're doing historically. And it becomes a global phenomenon of the tightening liquidity and you've got war. The odds of a global recession and a change in the macro economy are about as high and as severe as I've seen them in decades. Three questions. Are you seeing any sign of that in your commercial enterprise business in the United States? B, are you seeing it treating differently in Europe because they're dealing with gas prices. They're down a little, last couple weeks, but the equivalent of like $300 oil and three, what does it mean for Pell and Tear where we get a recession, in other words, a bad economic environment globally, but with all this crazy geopolitical stuff going on at the same time. So we, the crazy weird thing about Pell and Tear is we are heavily diversified by geography historically. Now, one of the dangerous things for Pell and Tear is just how well we're doing in America. So we went from a business that was majority outside of America in 2019 to a business that in two years will be 70% US-based. Wait, you went from, I'm supposed to know that I'm going to invest in it. You went from less than half in America to 70% in America in two years. In two years from now we will be a 70% US business. And will that increase to come more from government or commercial? The commercial business has been doubling every year this year. If you include Canada, it might double, but it went from a small integral 50 to 200 to 200. And now this is by the way, X-Back. It's not being driven by an organic revenue. The US business crossed the billion dollar mark on this year. So this is a big milestone. First, we crossed the billion dollar mark as a company and then the US. The US business has grown 61% annually. So Kager the last three years from just under $300 million dollar business to a billion dollar business, LTM, the last 12 months. So it's like this is like the interesting question for Pell and Tear is what the fuck is going on? And the US, why is it, why is this business? It's a 12 year old. It's a 12 year old. But the general thing is there's these macro conditions. I think obviously in many ways the US on energy and other things is better positioned than Europe. But the key difference for us is how do cultures respond to certain exogenous pressures? And for all the things that look weird outside, to people looking into the US, what is amazing about the US is the adaptive ability of US companies and US institutions. Obviously some things take too long and there are things that we don't like and they're corrosive. We sued the US government twice because of what we thought was unfair practices. But the US we came with kind of products that first with PG, which was a way of modeling data and a way of doing it where you could segment the data and still find people who are doing bad things. And then with Foundry, which is a completely anithetical to the market way of approaching software. So instead of selling a sliver of a piece of software with literally 5 to 10 salespeople per half-mangear you have that probably couldn't get a job at Pell and Tear. You know, you would, we led with an engineer focus and went for like the full value proposition. But in any case leaving that aside, this was something that every single analyst, every single person who's tasked with understanding the markets or the VC community, the academic community said would no one would ever buy. And America is quite willing to say, yeah, we wouldn't have bought that yesterday. We might not buy it today, but we'll look at it and then we'll quickly adapt and begin buying it and begin buying it. And what's also interesting about America is just at a more micrural level is in every other cultural in the world when you sell you get a niche. So you say software for automotive software for oil and gas. In fact, we're doing that. In America, buying large people are like, we just want to see if this will work for us. So there's like people are very willing to adapt to what works for them, independent of legitimacy criteria from other things. And from people that they don't normally know or normally not normally would not interact with. So there's that part just as a structural thing is very advantageous for us particularly in America, less advantageous for you know a lot of companies adjust for dollar because super strong and make excuses. But in reality, Europe is weaker for us than in America, even though if you adjusted for dollar, it's still quite normal standards like 25% or in the high above 20. And perhaps even 30% but what is it's adaptive now what's very good for us in general on the macro conditions, including outside of America is this energy crisis, inflation, geopolitical turmoil will break your internal IT system. And in fact, what is driving our sales outside of America is simply that if you're a large manufacturer and all of a sudden you have to repurpose where you're building your pumps because you can't get them from Ukraine and maybe you believe things you could purchase in China, you won't be able to supply to the US market. So a lot of most European companies have two basic markets, US and China and are there worried that in the near future you will have to build a product that for one that doesn't have supplies from the other. So that's a massive overhauling of your operational infrastructure. And because it's a low legitimacy environment, you're going to have to show you're going to have to show bureaucrats in both countries exactly where the product came from, the products came from visually. And that completely maps into this vertical and horizontal integration problem that is maps towards a disjoint set of geopolitical conditions where people don't trust each other. So you told me five or ten years ago that your biggest competitor were actually the legacy dinosaur tech departments at these various firms. Is what you're suggesting is there's so much up people here that this is causing firms to open their eyes to something new and better rather than just being able to go along with their subpar legacy stuff? It's quicker in America than other places and yes, but it's also because they like it's existentially crucial. So you they know that they will not be able to sell their product in the way they used to in the past and their systems will not actually be a cannot confront the way the conditions under which they have to sell now. And this is seeping into the landscape, but it's seeping in most quickly in America. And then you really there is a there is just a difference between America's willingness to adapt and adopt newer ways of doing things less ideological. And we have this also you know if you just look at the I spent a lot of my life in the germ seeking world and less so in France, but but you we we have this kind of plasticity where when you in say in Germany people go from CEO to board. It's a very tight community which has huge advantages historically in manufacturing, but it can be a disadvantage when technology is developing every year every two years and the new the newer things on the market of just way eclipse the older legacy businesses that have been providing you software for the last 20 years that are largely not relevant outside of outside of Europe, but but but but you're still kind of forced to buy from them. And and that's so that that's just a different set of problems that that say Europe has than America has. So early on in COVID I was talking to a friend who was in Washington working on the COVID problem and I said how's it going and it's a free disaster has been awful, but we're working with this company probably never heard of called Palantir. And he said there's real hope here because the stuff they have actually looks like it's going to work. So a how did Palantir get in there be everything you just said it seems like your success with COVID here and in the UK would be like a proof of concept massive advertisement. But for one of broader basis within industry so has has that happened is it also has this become known out there as a drawn a lot of other people to open their eyes to what you guys are doing. First of all is crazy motivational for us internally and you know the company was built for anti terror and military but you know we Palantir saved hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lives in this country and arguably in England and other countries. The disaster that we were facing because of disparate data sets that you would never be able to unify in a short period of time unless you would spend literally five seven years building a product that was the complete stack that you could install with the help of you know the Army Corps of Engineers that were fantastic. Was just one of the most crazy motivating things that I think all of us and my certainly I had the privilege to be involved in and and it's really even motivating now. It's I do think like now I think it's been less so than one would think because unfortunately you have this like because this you know you have this little bit of blue red facts and this was actually a totally nonpartisan thing this was done by the Army Corps of Engineers that are the least partisan people on the planet that the or the UK version is like you know maybe we shouldn't you know underestimate the credit because it's not going to be a big deal. You know it's just the company is CIA back so there's a little bit of tribalism here that prevents the facts from being disseminated as they are facts. However I believe the fact were the reality part of the reason we're doing so well in the US and the UK is there's just the kind of a mimetic. The economic thing where people you know in a world where many things don't work you have a thing that's transformative people if it was just COVID maybe they wouldn't you but it's COVID and are you know the integral of our business is doubling every year. Then you have this this growth engine that's like just massive growth and you have other things we're doing in the US government and then you have legitimacy Americans are very skeptical of everything that's not small business or the US Army. The only things that Americans actually have faith in maybe for good reason and these are things palatable powers and it gets out after a while and I think that is part of the reason we have very little marketing but people it actually gets out but one of the things I find sad is you know like we have lots of institutions that are sub optimal in the west and this is an incredible non partisan story and it's really important to learn the facts is because this won't be the last pandemic this won't be the last time I've used and there's a way. There's a way in which this really did lead to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people living or living better than they would have and learning how this happened how you do it what works what doesn't work is crucial for our societies and there's not been enough of that. It was a nice interview you did in the financial times with I think a Jillian Tedder that we can be aligning all this and you could tell she begrudgingly because of the publicity. Palantir has gotten on the left she but by the end of the article she seemed to be converted to me. Well she's very very smart and obviously you know her job is to be skeptical and she is skeptical. You know Britain's the United Kingdom's health system is actually 150 trusts that we unified with data protection norms and that's her her Julian task that saved British lives. And that's just something we have to keep reminding people of and I actually prefer people like her who are believers and skeptics. The best advocates for Palantir out there are people who are like yeah I kind of didn't believe them I didn't like them and they're like and then I tried it and I'm never going back. I was frustrated reading the article and then by the time I was I'm very loyalty guys but by the time I got to the end of the article the punch line was right I said oh this is good. Financial markets for first of all full disclosure I have I've had a bearish bias for 45 years that I've had to work around I like darkness. So when I look back at the boom market we've been in financial assets really started in 1982. All and particularly the last 10 years went into hyper drive all the factors that created that not only have sort of stopped they've reversed. So we had we had a government back then with a new president who said government is not the solution they're the problem. We had a guy who wanted to deregulate as opposed to regulate we had a chairman of the Fed Reserve named Paul Volker a little different than Jerome Powell and maybe most importantly we were right on the cusp of globalization that led to sort of one world a lot of productivity disinflation the response after the global financial crisis to that disinflation. With zero rates and a lot of money printing quantitative easing that created an asset bubble sort of in everything. Now they're like reform smokers they've they've gone from waiting to print a bunch of money to like driving a Porsche 200 I know they're Germans in the audience drive a Porsche 200 miles an hour like not only taking the foot off the gas just slamming the brakes on. So there's a high probability in my mind that the market at best is going to be kind of flat for 10 years sort of like this 66 to 82 time period but the nice thing is there were companies that did very very well in that environment back then that's when Apple computer was founded home Depot was founded coal and energy companies chemicals made a lot of money in the 70s. I'm not saying whether the scenario is going to be right or not but if it is right who will be the winner in the losers and where does Palantir fit in. In a way I come describing well there's like the financial part I think there's also like a weird corporate leadership part like are you actually built for times where things are kind of dark. Yeah that's the question and and you know we had the first arguably 16 years of Palantir we were built if everyone was like you're shrouded in secrecy we're also shrouded in the darkness of everybody wondering what is this crazy company doing you know and like being unpopular. I tend to see in what I think is going to be very difficult times enormous advantage for Palantir advantage one is just in hyper kind of euphoric or geastic times you have you have essentially competition for our talent that's real and so you know lots of companies are going to fail but they they prevent people from coming here and people who you know have frustrations like you know lots of frustrations like shadow hard. You know various frustrations I was going with people and it's like but instead of fixing those frustrations they join like insect.com and enjoy the perfect life while failing and that's that's actually that's actually been historically very very tough for us and frustrating for me personally. Then you have like what I tend to think in bad times you have to answer really simple questions that are not theological like what does your company do why would someone pay you more for it than then you paid to build it so like you know can you and what is your balance sheet like look like like do you have money in the bank how much money do you have the bank do you have debt are you building things that are useful are you building things are going to be useful tomorrow. Are those things going to be useful when people are really screwed or is it just staked in our sales like are you just actually selling it's like everyone is engaged in having fun and switching money around the sales people like the the sell these they're all and in fact it's just fun and you know you're all getting rich. And you know pounterians are really really bad at what I would call I'm not calling that corruption but it's like we're bad at like you know we all win while doing nothing kind of theater if you look at the people we hire why we hire these are like low theater high performance sometimes. We're just edgy people and that that's why and why are we building these very deeply in trans products primarily for mission reasons but the the weird thing about mission is it's a metaphor for this thing will actually save your life. And therefore you are going to buy it and you're going to pay us we don't we don't we have very fair relationships with our our partners but it's absolutely if you're saving someone's life it is absolutely okay to ask them for enough money that your life as a business continues and thrives and if you look at what palantier did. You know there's a huge leaving aside the the the DPO there were legitimate reasons why people are like well this company can't DPO they're making in 2019 750 and losing a couple hundred million dollars we went from a company that was losing money to now it's like making hundreds of millions of dollars a year we have 2.4 billion dollars in the bank no debt. These are not acquaintances and then we have their biggest assets like foundry has just been in to sell we have not really begun to sell Apollo we have all these war products that really people under value that were about to sell and we have a unique culture for building things and the leadership. I like bad times because bad times people it's like it's a lot of this comes to what was it like in like high school in bad times I do not have to fight with people about why I'm different I can explain to them how we're going to actually get things done in good times no one wants to talk to someone like me. It's like get out of the office leave me alone I don't want to hear this and even internally like you know we hire super super complicated talented hard to manage people and they don't want to listen to me either. But you know like in bad times like yeah you know we actually have to do this and things actually happen so you know I don't like the bad times because they're bad for other people covid pandemic wars disunity general recalibration of you know our asset our ass grades assets of you know institutions in the west that may not be working efficiently but I think it's really good if you're in the business of actually doing. Deep substantive transformation and you're not in the business of getting people to buy things that are really not that worthwhile. You sort of just answered my next question one of the cardinal rules I learned early on in these in venture capital is look where the kids are going and I think I bought your stock and I think it was so wait maybe it was so nine but I checked and you guys were a magnet. For talent and then things went up and down some and Alex whenever I would talk to you. When you look like the most enthusiastic and happy is when I ask you about the culture at palanterian stock of a carcassist started talking about palanterians and you just gave me about 70% of it but. Is that hiring cycle there's no way it could have sustained. What it was back then you were the company for the kids come out of Stanford MIT and Brown in those places has it cycle back up is it easier to hire people and I know you just gave me a lot in the last five minutes but is there anything you'd like to add to what makes a palanterian because I hear your eyes light up and ever talk about palanterians about the culture of a carcassist. But why the big is difficulty for us has not been recruiting the talent which I think you know you could say the integral of people who know us is expanded so greatly that in fact we just have more touch points so like sure it's like if you just focus on Stanford Stanford has a weird vibe. Stanford also changed you can see fluctuations but in fact if you look at the integral talent and then there's variations there as there always been geographic variations and who joins and under what conditions. I'd say the biggest issue for us has just been not being together during COVID and so one of the reasons I even wanted to do this is like okay we do event people show up like make sure everyone is. So you brought a 69 year old dinosaur in the interview. Well you know it's your old zone get into that you know. Yeah well you know there's there's a but I so I do you think there's like a lot we have to do on the culture to make up for the two years of being a part but what makes a palanterian a palanterian is somebody that comes here. Sometimes for the wrong reasons and discovers you know what I realize that at any other institution in the world so I'm not going to have the kind of freedom and autonomy to actually get mission stuff done and it's frustrating as it can be to have to convince the colleague next to me. It's also because they're frustrating me because I can say no and then and then I so I said that's the primary it's it's somebody who also of course. Reneweration is really important but I do think most people who come and stay here are really really focused on what are you building how are you building and what is the impact. And I do I think what we've proven a palanter is if you're very focused on that. That often but doesn't always work out better than the people who are just focused on like trying to get rich tomorrow. You often don't get rich so true but yeah and and then hate you if you happen to get like because you make all the wrong decisions and then it's from how worked out right but. But and and so I think that. Poundarians do believe that there is like a higher more noble thing that you know then just you know the near term respect and near term. Reneweration I think that. And so I think that. Poundarians are tend to be pretty tough so like they it's like are willing to actually go through difficult times and being an outsider and fight fight for things and in general really kind of get off on making the world a slightly better if not much better place. And then on the recruitment front I think they're just it is we really really benefit from the lack of alternative alternatives and it's partly because the alternatives everyone's like mission mission mission it's so obviously fake. And like it's so like somebody's pound is also to say obvious a very very smart and the sales efforts of these companies are so obviously fake and they do not convincing and then I think they get all the wrong people who are like pretending they care but just want the attendees the jargon term for money nowadays that. 12 year old. And then it's compounding it's like you know I ran into somebody he was telling someone else this is an expound charities like look pound you're being a crazy place and this is somebody is running it coming is like but if you want to do mission stuff it is the only place at scale. And like and then I like I just got I just have been going client to client office office at a high level I went from Denmark where we played a normal roll because of data protection to Israel where we play a very important role to the Emirates where we play a very important role. To London where we play in a very important role like these are countries where we play and I haven't had a material and my in my view back to America but material in my view unique role that had we not done this it would be a different world and so you could take Europe I believe you're up would be completely run by the far right had our products not been installed and I don't mean far far right conventional what you guys may mean like do stepping right. I believe the Middle East I know the Middle East the Europe would have had major terror attacks same thing in the Middle East America would be very different had another five six hundred seven hundred thousand people died in cobit and other events the institutions that we power commercially some of them survive because of us that safety events that don't have you know don't bad things that don't happen on the safety front so it's like material impact and by the way there are people every single part of the world. The person here has been on an appointment they hated that was less impactful and that's part of the price. So there was a guy named Steve Jobs and he broke the number one rule of business is he made products not that the customer's demanding he made this product and assumed if I make it they will come. I kind of get that sense that you can do that here at Palantir too and I know that what a game changer foundry was for you. Is there something else out there in the pipeline I don't know about that you can I'm sure there is but that you could disclose so I can think of a few years ahead of time. There's the war products which are like literally take small countries and make them into juggernauts like take every give everybody a slingshot every small country gets the power slingshot Palantir and can slay the monster coming to attack them and there's like a number of them and they're operational useful and very quick watching one of them. It's not so small. Yeah well and it's having an enormous impact and then there's the further uses of foundry which are really just at the beginning actually using pound operationally and there's a pile of like we're in a world where the outside organizations are disjoint and and and just junked and need vertical and horizontal integration to interact with their clients and with regulators and with supply chains. They have the same exact problem with software on the inside which is how we actually have grown from a tiny company with you know not growing headcount but because we maintain our software with a product every single company every single company every single government in the world will essentially have to build something like this or buy it from us and it's a very very hard product to build and that product is like many of our products kind of looks very not sexy in the beginning but then powers a lot of the action. So I mentioned earlier that I sort of spent the first half of my career with globalization actually the first three quarters and then with trumpets started the other way and is continued to that way is this going to be like I'm 69 is this going to be the rest of my life we're never going to have one world is them again. I don't think we're going to have that for a while and I you know we're betting our products to this point of building products for the future in the past it's like the products are built because I don't believe that that world is with us anymore and you see how quickly the politicians who really are very good at figuring out what the reality is and then selling it to you is like some kind of ideological thing but. They're best at how quickly they're shifting and I think they're right to shift and like if you look at how America and Europe are now viewing other countries and what they're requiring of their supply chains or the data flow how things are built it's like I think that world is largely over one of the hard things that's going for people who are joining Palantir or younger is you've been completely socialized for a world that is evaporating and it's not the world we're in anymore. I said I'll never forget my partner who interviewed you a year or two ago said to me during the Trump reign he said I don't think people realize this will be the peak of US China relations in the next 25 years they're not going to do anything but get worse and it sounded so ridiculous at the time it was you know three or four years ago and it looks like that we're on that trip. No I agree. Yeah. Thank you for coming and I just want to say I it's an honor to be here I'm proud of all you guys everything you're doing and Alex it's been a joy to be associated with your company for as long as I have. Thank you and for us too. Thank you.
