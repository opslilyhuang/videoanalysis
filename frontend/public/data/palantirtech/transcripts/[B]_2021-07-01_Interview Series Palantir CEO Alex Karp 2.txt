The The The The The The The The The The The The So Alex Mark, Alex when we met, there were five years ago, we did together a project a little A little crazy, we developed it, it's not a little crazy, it's necessary. This is a project of a band we made together, what we have a little bit to tell Things that we had never told before. It was the real history of the Palantir. The real history of the old. The old. The old. The old. The old. The old. The old. The old. The old. The old. And why did you actually want to do this thing? This is the cultural object, like that in French, why did you not? And because you were born, we almost fell down with the French band, I said to you. Well, yes, but that's the time, but also the hysterics, it's the real French. And in fact, I took a lot of new things when I was a child of the whole world, with the Really with the time, and when I was more than a small man, I had the culture, in fact, the good of the French. It's a way to tell the history of the world, about the history of France, the history of wars, artistic things, and philosophical things, very complicated, but you can understand that as well as very small. And also, in fact, the French culture is a very interesting culture, because it's a beginning of long history, but also of maths. And it's actually the Bande Cissé, it's rather of maths, also of maths than of the Couture. And that's it. And you don't find that in the other? Always exists, but it's different. I made the Bande Cine in English, the Bande Cine in French. I also made a loop, but also many Bande Cine, to jury the Dungeons and Dragons, and also the little ones. And in general, in general, the exceptions in the Bande Cine in French, the Bande Cine is the type of people who are almost true. It's not, if it's all the time, it's alpha, it's actually the truth. Almost always the guy, but also the girl. It's not really the superhero, it's actually the kind of people with a problem, but it's really hard to do very important things. And in fact, that's the same thing with Palentir. We're not the normal Tutufé, it's really bad, but we're the people who are together, we're doing things from us. But how are the real people, it's not like the superhero, but not like the exagerant Bande Cine in American? And you just notice when you discover this Bande Cine on Palentir? Yes, but you have to do the auction, it's a very bad thing in the business networks, we did it in a way, we worked together. Tell me how you met all of them. I don't necessarily mean professional points, but how did you start the first time you met them? On the other hand, it was simple, it was the first time I met Alex, he was in California, when he was a young kid with Tom Ender, when we made a Scal... Yes, but I was surprised that you explained that you were a tremendous person, because you were a man, a man, a man, a man, a man. At the time we worked on Scherbuss. Tom was the CEO of Erbus, I was on the second-year-old general, not yet his manager, but Chief Digital Officer. We met on the innovation, digital, what can it be? What can it be called for a bus? A big group of the eros, but well with huge ones. And what does it mean, the guides, if the Convales, Palentir, the Bitoucis, the Amazon? And that's what we tried to translate Scherbuss into digital transformation, between 2015 and 2012 and today. And that's where we met Alex, and the origin was rather on, explain the Silicon Valley, and explain to us, especially at the time, the cybersecurity. And actually, the first discussion we had was on cybersecurity. And I remember that the second discussion was about all of us when we came to see with Tom, it was about to start. And there, it was, yes, it's the cybersecurity. I explain to you, the data, we mix it all up, we told him, mix it up, but we have a lot of trouble mixing our data in our big, systematic system. And he said, it's easy. The cybersecurity is complicated in general, but mixing data without doing it. And that's where we started to test. Yes, but we have to be careful. The less skeptic, I have you. That's right. Because it was the decades we tried. And it's very complicated. The silo of data of systematic systems is very complicated, it's very complicated, the silo of a group like Erbus. It's hundreds or thousands of them, like in other companies, not only Erbus. And we understand that systems and data are two different things. That is, we can integrate data to make points between systems. That was that, I was going to say in French, the conceptual thank you, that we did together. But there were a lot of things. There are people who were very skeptic, because Erbus is a brother with a very professional, and it's a very difficult thing to do. It was difficult, it's not possible that a American brother would do things here. And he's also skeptic because he was a American brother, who worked with the service that was created in the world. But it was very difficult. I have never forgotten, I have a one-off interview in Erbus with the man and the girl who works there. He was very, very proud of his work, and I was able to do it with his brothers, like that. It's a necessary thing when it comes to him. It was extremely well received, because it's very difficult, it's true in other industries, to give the power to people who do operations. Because they have given it, they need it at the right time to take good decisions. It's that, that's what is extremely satisfying. And we have made dozens of Yusuke, of Cadusage, in Erbus, we have demonstrated value, and we have seen that this applies, and you do it in full company. There is something extremely democratic. If I'm not talking about democracy, it will go on the politics. There is something extremely democratic, I find, in the US transformation, which is effectively transparency, given visibility, and given it to the right level. And it causes a little bit of the organisations, it gives power to the audience. Is there anything that was the most surprising for you? When we started to say it, you were going, what was it that you thought was MacFoop? And after... I had an advantage, I don't want to become IT, I come from business. And so Tom, also, Fabrice, the boss of Erbus too, we come from business. And so, your world, we don't know. And if someone tells us that I know how to do it, we try. And I think the culture of the risk of trying to do it was good. And we were surprised by the result. It's that it's that it's true. The result at the beginning, as you know, it was different. Things we did in a week at the end, at the beginning we put 16 months on the 350. We put 16 months to convince, to have the money, to find the cases of use, etc. So what surprised me was the rapidity we could make when the conditions were united. The 2 value degrees we could get out, we are talking about several. The improvements to 2 shifts on the most part of industrial processes. And then the quality of people. And I think that the quality of people, I think, it will be a lot of surprise. Because, you said that we have a lot of people, extremely competent everywhere. But people who can make their full potential, that's more difficult. And you realized that, on the one hand, of the engineers, I have you, and of our engineers, of our technicians or of our blue eyes. And you find people who say to you, globally, thank you. Because what you have done is what I have been waiting for 15 years to be able to do my job. And that's simple. But to do it is not simple. But it's not a very specific thing. It's you who took it very quickly. And you want to do Skywise. It's maybe good when you explain the origin. But in fact, the most wide Skywise, or more likely, the Skywise is the project of software which is more interesting than all the other companies. And maybe in the world. Because Skywise is going to be so young, we have done it by accident. So, how about you? I have done it by accident. One of the numerous qualities of the Skywise. In fact, Skywise, in the origin, is the data lake, the lake of data for airbus. That is to say, what we want to say is how we can extract data, and put them in a few places so that the operational can solve their problems. And moreover, we saw that it was flexible. On all the cases, quality, the chain of provision, the planning of production, the clients, the service. We said, but the plane doesn't stop at the exit of the lake, we have to go to the clients, then we have to go to the companies. And from there, it's become a platform. So, what was at the beginning, a project of internal improvement, and it came from a platform, a multi-utilizer, with more than a hundred of companies on the side, and a certain of the suppliers on the other. And it was, indeed, for us, for airbus, for the team, something fantastic. Between what was used in the past, the first contact we had, we said, what can we do with that? Until five years later, we made a platform, B2B, we wouldn't have believed it. And I think, more generally, of the airbus, what is happening is that we have a lot of industry. That is, we need to have a heart that connects a certain actor from the subsidiary, something that is the subsidiary, it's something extremely important. And it's unique. Yes, unique. And there, which creates a level of efficiency, and complements the government level, in other words, the voice of the audience, which is huge. We still have a reserve of productivity, which is very important. That's a good thing for us. Yes, for me, it was also for the history of the Paralyzedians very important, because I think, in fact, the past, the most ancient software in the world that has passed, is the most developed luxury. But now, if you want to survive, it is necessary to work with the software. And the SkyWise was, in the first example of making software in the world of economics, which is, in fact, the proof that with software, really, it is fake, you can change the world. Absolutely. And then we have created together, that's what we said. We have discovered our world, and then you have discovered a little bit with the industry, a little bit. So, it allowed us to automate some things, and then it allows us to do things like today, or look together, so we can go on smaller companies, where things could be simpler, more affordable, and more of the shelf, plug-in play, in French. It's hard. And then everything that is digital native, everything that you do, also, on all the new societies. So, I think it's, indeed, to democratize itself, if software allows it.
