TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

you . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the state of Florida. We have six hospital system with our flagship thousand bed academic medical center, about 150 ambulatory locations and we serve about 6.7 million patients across about 15 counties within Florida. We've been partnered with Palantir for a little over three years now and when we first started we had a lot of big problems to solve with our health system. We started making quite a few point solutions but as we were making those solutions and deploying those solutions we saw threads. Information from one solution really needed to be uncovered in another one one group of of customers needed information that was determined in another solution and we really started to see everything kind of come together for what we're now calling the modern hospital OS. So today we're going to walk through a little bit of what that looks like starting with what our our data foundation looks like. So the core of all of the works that we've done is that we've done is in this ontology layer. You can see each of our workflows is built on one or more agents. You can see those agents here in purple. Those agents query specific patient information which you can see here in red and that information has different logic functions done on it or mathematical calculations which is then written back into the ontology and you can see that right back in yellow. So this is basically the architecture that ensures a single source of truth for all of our patient information, all of our employees, all of our team members. So they're all making decisions on the same information. Data architecture is interesting and everything but what does that really mean for our patient population. So today we're going to walk through a little bit of a patient journey starting with our sepsis response hub. Sepsis is a really interesting diagnosis and it's the number one driver from Arbidity and Mortality in hospitals worldwide as well as a really great opportunity for us to have early intervention and early treatment algorithms. When we intervene or when we find a sepsis patient early we determine that they have sepsis and we treat them with the appropriate algorithms very early in their course. We change their outcomes exponentially. We can get patients home safer. Let's dig into this sepsis response hub. So our rapid response team at the hospital monitors this 24-7. The rapid response team is a group of very highly trained nurses that monitors clinical deterioration and high risk conditions within our hospital. Within this hub it shows any patients that have a concern for sepsis. You can see Miss Jane Thornfield here. She's in our ED. We have some vital signs here that are abnormal and look like they're getting a little bit worse. We may have a little bit of organ dysfunction happening and we have a suspected source of infection. So big risk for sepsis for this patient. One big piece of one really important thing about all of the work that we do within our modern hospital operating system is data transparency. So any piece of data that you see within these systems you can click on it'll dig into it open up where and the patients chart that information comes from give you all of the context around that information so that you have clarity into why we're making these decisions and what the next steps should be. This really creates trust with our clinicians and makes sure that we have clinical accuracy. We also always have a human in the loop with everything that we do making sure these tools are uncovering information at the point of decision not actually making decisions they're just uncovering the appropriate information and giving it to our clinicians. So now that we've validated that Miss Thornfield actually probably has sepsis the next step is to contact the provider rapid response team puts that call out they decide together that a sepsis alert should be placed and that alert is placed. That then causes Mrs Thornfield to be flipped over to our sepsis alert hub. This is the second part which is the treatment and management of sepsis what this does monitors everybody in the hospital that has a sepsis alert making sure they're getting the right treatment at the right time. You can see most everything is done for Mrs Thornfield but we do have a flag here that says the fluids haven't yet been administered. We can see they've been ordered but they haven't been administered. The really important thing here is the rapid response team can see that call down to our Florence hey how can I help you what can I do to help move this patient along so really making sure that those patients get the care that they need. Previous to this it was a very cognitively heavy process relying on one clinician to do all of it now we still let our clinicians do the bulk of the work but if something falls out we have a backup system in place of a reliability. So now let's jump into the actual hospital we're going to follow Miss Thornfield into her care into one of our units with our care navigation view. The Thornfield is now in the ICU you can see our care navigation view here shows some clinical information including she's on a ventilator shows some of the treatments that are happening including some imaging that's pending as well as any care pathways she's on and we can see what some next steps might be we can see that she came from one of our other hospitals isn't really eligible for transfer back there but is might be eligible for our hospital at home program. One really interesting thing here is previous to this tool we didn't have transparency into all of the systems that we had in place and eligibility for our patients for those systems it relied on whoever was caring for the patient to understand the process get the patient in and really figure out how to get them keyed into that program. Now all of this is codified within one one place and no matter who's coming in if it's a brand new intern on day one or a season clinician they have the same information in front of them to make decisions. It's really helpful. Other things you see here clinical summaries at the bottom of this this view we have clinical summaries information from the chart where before we would dig around in the chart for multiple minutes to learn information it's all here and again data transparency we can click on any piece and it'll show us exactly where that comes from. So now moving on with Miss Thornfield for do to some excellent care from our clinicians at Tampa General she's doing much better and it appears that she's ready for downgrade out of the ICU. The tool verifies that information and brings that up on our multidisciplinary rounds for the clinical team to be able to make that decision. With one click they can verify all that information put in some info for our bed planners and submit that request to them. Previous to this all of our bed planning was very reactive. What we did an order was placed and then the bed planners would have to work really hard to find the right bed make sure it met the patients needs and get the patient in that bed. Now that we have this information 24 36 hours in advance we can make all of those subsequent moves have time to get the bed cleaned patients moved around to get that patient there ultimately appropriate bed. So next step we're going to talk about what the patient placement team sees so we'll go to our patient placement bed planning view. You can see in the upper right they've gotten a notification from us saying that Mrs Thornfield's headed to the step down unit we'll click on that notification and we can see all of the information all of the criteria for the bed that Miss Thornfield needs and we see we have a bed actually available for her adult step down three F meets all of the criteria so what we can do is we can click begin bed planning but if for some reason that bed wasn't appropriate or we didn't have a bed available we could alternately click the final turn into bed for patients. The really interesting thing about this is when we click that it will give us some multiple options sometimes even including multiple step moves so that we can move one patient into another appropriate bed so that we can open up a bed for Mrs Thornfield or any other patient. This is really helpful again cognitive load the goal of everything that we're doing is really to reduce the cognitive load on our teams and give them the information that they need at the point of decision so that they can make the decision and and move our patients through our system efficiently. That's incredible that is awesome I mean that journey the fact that you're really orienting the technology around the patient and they're journey through the system like of course this is powerful tooling but the end of the day the patient stays at the center right I guess to kind of wrap this up that's obviously just one over three of a handful of workflows that connects into this operating system how does this change the way that you guys think about the next challenge the next use case you sort of starting from this framework and compounding upon it like how do you think about that. Yeah so in the beginning we took the problem and we tried to fix the problem now that we have this framework we're taking the framework and we're saying how can we use this framework to fix the next problem our next big problem is actually our operating room space and we're really excited about digging in there and figuring out how to make sure that our patients have everything they need when they show up to the OR so their cases aren't canceled make sure that we can get all of their authorizations in place early so that we can have that efficient flow through the OR space and back out home which is the ideal place. That's awesome and that operating room scheduling and management is actually one of the workflows we're going to be seeing in one of our upcoming key notes later today so I think it's one of those great teams of AIP con there's a lot of sort of areas that people are tackling from different angles and the big part of AIP con it all being customer led is y'all can all learn from each other so Jamie thank you so much for that walk through that's a great we'll have some time to dive into that a bit more detail a little bit but I kind of want to take that same operating concept operating system concept and shift it over to an entirely different journey we talked about the journey the patient Kelly you're going to be talking about the journey something very different tell us a little bit about what you guys are doing at Land of Frost. Absolutely absolutely so I'm with Land of Frost we are a third generation family owned lunchmeap packaging organization we do some sausage and as well as we have a variety of brands in both our conventional space as well as our natural specialty you would see our well shy our brand and such places as whole foods and sprouts so we're all over the country and what we're really focused on is optimization right and not just equipment optimization which we've done a lot of work on automation and things like that the past but also our internal processes and really streamlining where we can so we partnered with Palantir back in September and identified three use cases in our planning organization so first starting off with our master planning area then going into finite scheduling and then going into clear to build so that's what I'm going to walk you guys through today and show how we've optimized our our process and taken what we asked me to be anywhere from 70 to 80 hours worth of work per week out of our overall process so here's a really great dashboard historically we did everything in Excel so downloading from our ERP system putting it into Excel creating reports this is a great dashboard for an executive to come in or even our master scheduling team to come in and really understand what's happening as far as customer fulfillment Jamie talked about you know customer patient care and we talk about quality of good products going to our customers and ensuring great service to our customers it's the same concept right as we're working through our organization so as we go through it we're looking at you know where can we service our customers what's our inventory levels all of this is live data that we can you know show graphs on and don't have to download and into analysis as we move forward so this has been a great import into our area these are reports that our team have been doing in the past sitting out via email we can now come in here right now and see live data as of this morning which is fantastic and then as we look at our master scheduling process which was our first use case we've been able to create our production schedule going out 18 months into the future and when we're going through our annual operating program this used to take us about 40 hours to put together this can be done in about 30 minutes so huge optimization from us especially when we're running scenario planning you can see the kind of seasonal build that we have from a lunch meat perspective so that really helps us identify ways that we can improve and maybe move some stuff around so as we move forward the other thing that we take a look at is where our optimization happens in the manufacturing plant so changeovers to huge costs for us we really want to reduce the amount of changeovers that we have in the organization because the more changeovers you do that means the line is down and you're not running product so that chart they're kind of showed our historical changeovers and what we've seen by the implementations that we've just done recently is a reduction in those changeovers and we have all kinds of constraints that cause us to do changeovers which I'll get into here in a little bit so as we kind of look at our master scheduling process you know we we create a master schedule which really says we're going to produce this product in this plant during this week and then we kind of give it to our manufacturing team and say okay now identify these products what lines they're going to be run on what days and what quantities and the idea is that we are achieving a hundred percent against our master schedule so this is a great tool for our planners to go into and identify where am I missing from a production perspective you can see we have a hundred percent here of course we're doing a great job we've scheduled everything we said we're going to do and it's interesting these little pucks here which will get into a little bit of a demo on later this was actually something that I identified when I attended another palentine event and it was for an airline industry and they showed how if a flight gets moved or scheduled these pucks move similar concept if something happens we don't get raw materials in on time or we have to move out our production schedule these pucks all move and congruence with each other so it's a great opportunity to really kind of think through different industries and how you can adapt it to what you have in your existing industry but what we're going to go through now is we're going to go through a scenario where we take a look at some specific skews and identify where we can go so we have some constraints that we have in the meat processing industry if you think about when you make paint for example you want to start with white and then you want to add your colors and go into black give a similar situation when you get into meat processing where you want to start with kind of your base item first you don't want to run black pepper turkey first and then you have pepper going into other items is a huge no no right so we have a sequence that we have to run our items in and we built that into this tool and the idea is that if I had a planner in our Madisonville Kentucky facility and she needed to do planning for our source the Arkansas plant all those requirements are already built in we have a lot of tribal knowledge in our organization we have someone who's been with the organization for 40 years and we've taken the opportunity to put all of her knowledge into the tool so that when someone new comes in they don't have to go reference a spreadsheet or go reference a sticky note somewhere it's all built into the tool for them to really optimize it's weird forward so as we're planning the tools can identify how many crews we need on a specific line how many changeover something might cause one or two or five depending on what we might be running that day but it also gives the planners an idea of what the optimization is so as we go through it and they may say I don't want to run that specific item on that specific day they can actually take these pucks and move them from one day to the next move them around from a sequencing perspective and if they do it and it's not in the right sequence it's gonna give them an error so that's the huge amount of trouble and knowledge that we have we have one planner who just started with us a year ago and she said if I would have had this a year ago it would have been so much easier to onboard and so much faster right so we're doing some really great work with getting that tribal knowledge in getting alerts in our quality team has done a wonderful job of creating you know our matrix as far as our washdowns go so that we can really achieve the least amount of changeover as possible and then here we have an idea we're clicking into a specific skew and you can see there on the right the historical run rates of all of the pieces of equipment that have ever ran this item in the last 90 days and we're taking that information to determine what are our run rates as we move forward and that's identifying where our capacity is and so if a planner would like to move this puck to another line they can actually look in here and see well what is the best line that this is actually run on in the past versus going off of tribal knowledge which may not be accurate this is data and we're making assumptions and we're making decisions based on the data that's being provided versus hearsay if you will right the other thing that we're taking a look at is do we have the inventory needed to manufacture this item so we're gonna follow this log through into our cook cycle and see when is this log gonna be made because it was red and it's telling me I don't have any log inventory to produce that but if we come in here and see oh this item is gonna be cooked on this specific day to support that overall production run it gives them that overall view to really make those decisions on whether or not they can move forward and then we're gonna take a look at our emotion level so kind of goes all the way down when we built this it's not just about packaging it's about our cook schedule and our stuffing schedule and our emotion schedule and ultimately getting into our raw material purchases which we'll get into here in a moment and making sure that we're making the right decisions from a raw material perspective because that's also where we have a huge opportunity from a money perspective right so this one's telling me I have all these items that are gonna be available when I go to run our finished good that we had looked at earlier and now I'm gonna take a look at our raw materials and do I have the right raw materials in place to run what I need to run when I need to run it but also taking a look at what are our alternatives from a raw material perspective and can I substitute something based on the price that we have from a contract and based on the price it's in the marketplace and we have a great opportunity to hopefully save some money there as we go through and identify what substitutes may be in place but we're really excited to kind of bring this to an end you know we've been working on it since September we hope to have it completed in the next couple of months but three use cases in a really short amount of time and looking forward to some other opportunities for us as well that is incredible I was honestly lost for words now all of that I was hoping to sort of get conversation going and I was just it bottles the mind I think a few things to stand out for me and like actually I would love to get your thoughts as well I think firstly we've seen the same platform serve to very different journeys very different industries but also to a level of depth where the software is shaping to your needs right it wasn't that you felt the need to constrain your workflow to a format that also fits a hospital system like this is truly custom stuff but as you say deliverable in a matter of weeks and months actually as we think about this operating system concept what are your thoughts well I think both examples at a great job of showing not just connected data but connected operations and having these outcomes that were in mind almost before the software but then being able to unlock more and more iterative value as you deliver each incremental use case so it's this idea of saying well I have a long-term plan but I want to step into it in transform while I'm modernizing right so I think it's all directed by value at the end of the day people's lives actual you know food and and things that are critical to their lives and I think that outcome orientation is what gets us all working on these platforms every day that's incredible and speaking of which I think we kind of teed up that idea of how do you think about the next problem I imagine you're not just transforming technology you're also bringing these teams together to collaborate and chain decisions in a way that just wasn't possible or certainly wasn't efficient previously so curious from both of you like in terms of the people within your organizations how are they thinking about making decisions differently is this kind of transforming strategically where the company's going beyond just the tech yeah I think I can go for it so our mission at Atlanta for us our purpose is really to make everyday more fulfilling than the last right and that's more than just serving food to people and nourishing them right it's also intellectually internally with our costs with our internal selves to make it more fulfilling when you come into your day today job right it's not just copying and pasting data from an Excel spreadsheet you're actually able to make decisions and that's what we've learned from this is we're now able to make more strategic decisions and identified hey if I would have followed what Palantir's tool said actually would have had a better plan two weeks from now than what I did on my own right so it's making those decisions and making that leap to really change the course of how you're thinking about things and really being more strategic than just copying and pasting data back and forth 100% I mean Jamie curious to see how is that same thing applying the health care well very similar you know we we when we engage with Palantir it's really about making sure that the tool fits the workflow for our team historically when things come into health care it's here's this tool you have to change your workflow to fit it our teams are really excited because now we're coming in and we're saying what is your workflow how can we help make that workflow more efficient and they engage at a hundred percent every single time and we have people coming to us now and saying we need your help because they see the outcomes so everybody's really excited about the work that we're doing here and the next steps maybe I'm curious to like pick up on that point there we talk as Palantir a lot about the forward deployed approach to bringing our engineers on site like really sitting in your seat living that workflow and sort of building from there right so kind of curious how does that experience been for you guys like I've certainly thoroughly enjoyed working with both your teams at Palantir to kind of get this ready and like learn your story and see you sort of pull this together how's it work out for you working with your teams from Palantir I mean it's been an amazing partnership actually one of our executives has said that you know of all of the consultants that we've had Palantir is the first one that's really come in tried to understand our workflows and made a difference which is a testament to the work that you guys do all of our teams love when they see that the engineers coming and it's really interesting because we'll go in with one thought in mind and multiple times the engineer has seen a little bit of a workflow that somebody needed changed and they'll whip up a quick tool and be like here use this so people are running down knocking down our doors trying to get the engineers and I love walking through the halls because I'll see a random engineer I'll be like hey what are you doing here and then they tell me all about what they're learning and it's super interesting to see how quickly they can come into a completely new space understand the workflows understand how people do their work and offer up suggestions to change it I think sometimes we get so set in our ways you know we've been in healthcare for a long time this is how we do things that outside perspective is really helpful to come in and say hey well why are you doing it that way maybe you should think about doing it this way and we're like oh maybe we should and it really makes a huge difference and Kelly you mentioned that yourself like you saw a Palantir pre that other event you saw a workflow from the airlines world and that was the inspiration for the work video like the scheduling the dynamic scheduling component of what you just showed like it sounds like gathering those sort of thoughts from compete different industries many different workflows can still be a great source of inspiration oh absolutely and the Palantir team brings those to you as well right I mean I'm always amazed by I get to the point where I have you know something that we want to work on and the next morning they come in and they're like we worked on this last night and look here's a Virgin Zero and it's amazing that there's so fast on it but it's because you're drawing from so many different resources that have that input and that data from historical references it's great that's awesome well I mean if we're all a little bit sleep deprived today you know why like putting together these stories really does take a bit of work but honestly that is our time for the pre-show so thank you so much again thank you to Jamie thank to Kelly thank to actually for joining me on the pre-show do not go anywhere we have a four-day programming lined up for you welcome once again to AIPcon7 I don't think in wind-leaves I think in domination with palantir palantir palantir palantir palantir palantir palantir palantir we've got real both palantir palantir literally gutting like I can't even tell you how the internal systems can be repising it with palantir our team's continued to develop new use cases for the boundary soft which will prove real time this is amazing on the plan for it was a mortgage case fraud case there's a lot of paper dreams of paper it took our really talented investigators 60 days to detect fraud in two of these files it took your technology ten seconds like holy please welcome co-founder and chief executive officer of palantir dr Alex Carp welcome welcome to palantir and welcome to Silicon Valley Silicon Valley has gone through many many phases the most important phase was when it was fully aligned with the US and the West which is how in part we won World War II and how we changed the world to become freer more democratic more tolerant more willing to listen how everyone's center of living went up and basically people learned to get along and then we have the last phase and then you had the consumer internet thing I I bash it all the time now it's kind of boring to bash these things this concern it Carson the genic waste of time ways of flushing our tone it's a talent down the toilet and most importantly they did not transfer any wealth to the populace either intellectual capital or ways of organizing and so we got a very very divided West and now we're in a weird phase with with AI where it's like a very very unusual revolution and there is a and some people are doing very well the large language miles on their own I think have been proven to be somewhat not useful unless you want to cheat on your homework which could be valuable depending on the BS homework you're getting and it's a bananza for dyslexics like me because you know who cares about all that stuff you just you get paid for being creative and but this moment we're in with as embodied in foundry ontology and you is a very very special moment because there is a very selective transfer of knowledge and opportunity to a very select group of people largely defined by are you willing to evaluate things that work or are you gonna buy some BS ideology that worked in the past maybe it worked in the 50s maybe it worked two years ago by and large in my view my view we're not a money culture a palantir but by and large is just set up to trick you to have no value but to feel good about getting done for every day and we're not in that business at palantir and our approach to the battlefield is exactly the approach we have in US commercial which is why we grew 71 percent in US commercial with a rule of 83 which basically means we're doing it with no BS very little sales no overhead people are buying the product in its pure form the young people here would say we're like the pure drug on the streets high priced a real hit you feel good for days and it makes you stronger and better now I don't know if that's the right metaphor it's not exactly my metaphor I like fitness and but it the the the thing about this revolution is that it shifted the whole Silicon Valley landscape now the official version of Silicon Valley is a truly interesting once in a generation once in a in a national history kind of thing we happen to have it we have other tech centers where de facto we dominate the world mostly from here and other tech sectors that are outside of here but in America and even the Valley the secret of the Valley right now the secret you're not allowed to say to anyone is everyone's given up when randomly just sprinkling their dollars on startups you know what they're all interested in they're interested in you growth plus ontology plus foundry plus large language models they want you you know why they want you because with ontology foundry and any language wise moral that we orchestrate with you we can change your unit economics to being pretty close to ours with your sized revenue and then you guys can also get up and pull the freak show act that I am and tell people who are insulting our country and who are against meritocracy and against free speech whatever you want to tell them whenever you want to tell them you get the freedom because if you have 71% growth in US commercial and 45% growth in government like we do and you have a role of eighty three or anything close to that especially with the way everything you get freedom and I'll tell you everyone here you tired of that BS investor who has no idea what they're talking about you want to grow your company because you're a world-class investor even quicker you're tired of having some analyst who woke up on the wrong side of bed and decided they didn't like you because they didn't get into your company or they don't like you because you're not cool enough you're tired in our case of being attacked by people who seemingly can't go online and spend five minutes looking at our architecture but are so committed to being a product of their own weak thin religion that they're motivated by being poorer and hurting us you have the freedom to tell those people to go back and suffer and sick fail on their own because of your unanimonomics and we are going to help you get there because that is a better world for you and a much better world for us and people in this room have already begun that journey some of you guys most of you are at the beginning most of you people here who are exceeding are only using part of our product use the rest we will subsidize you using the rest negotiate with us I'll tell you how you should negotiate with us I'll use the product in its totality and I'll move quicker than anyone else but I'm gonna pay you a little less so I see the results AB test our product against what you're using AB test our product against large length of models AB test our product against the PowerPoints AB test our product against what the New York Times says AB test again just AB test do it on your own negotiate effectively we want speed we want and need this country to be the strongest most important country in the world and we I'm super proud of our stuff on that battlefield and what we do to protect our soldiers to protect the data to prevent abuses of the data to prevent people from using that data to weaponize it and to kill our enemies and scare them because they know they will be killed that's my agenda doesn't have to be yours but the single biggest thing that will make this country dominant and get rid of the parts of our country that are not meritocratic and our whining about things they don't understand is to make industry in this country look like venture did and give venture returns to growth and that's what we're about a pound here and that's what where this conference is actually about and you should negotiate very effectively with us and use the rest of the product and get a discount and run like hell because someone else is going to do it and they are going to change their unit economics if you don't believe me walking around here in Silicon Valley and the key to dealing with Silicon Valley people which I didn't understand one of the main reasons they wouldn't invest obviously was they at the time were not super into being pro west being pro America but another reason is we were like hey we're gonna be really good we're gonna build data systems they're really valuable we're too nice don't be too nice tell the people here you got a week trains leaving the station I'm gonna change my business as you can unit economics in the next three to six months and succeed and we want to be part of that journey with you and we want to be paid the single most unique thing that actually pound here does is we own value creation you should pay us based on the value a subset of the value we create for you test it I hope you have a great time I'm really happy to you back in the valley and finally we have a ball or intro we're gonna put this online we usually historically have a little bit of dental music going by our product we're trying to be better than it is welcome it's great pleasure to have you here hope to see all of you soon and we really really invest in you guys as partners we view as partners that also does that also means by the way we're gonna tell you what we think you don't have to listen but we are sure as hell gonna tell you that's not gonna work this could work they could work don't buy us by them that's what we do and looking forward to having a long history with all of you take care please welcome global chief data officer at AIG Jim Young good morning my name is Jim Young and I'm the global chief data officer at AIG and I'm delighted to be with you today my role puts me at the intersection of data technology and a transformation and I'm excited to present today what our team have built with the assistance of partners to transform a core function of our business commercial underwriting I'm sure many of you have heard of AIG we're a leading global insurance company we help businesses and individuals in over 200 countries and jurisdictions protect what matters most by managing risk and providing insurance solutions at the core of this is underwriting as you can see 70% of our business is commercial underwriting underwriting is the process where we assess risk and determine coverage it's where we decide do we insert this business and what's the right coverage it's one of the most critical and complex decisions we make and it was stuck in a process that hadn't really changed for 50 years AIG has leaned head first into AI in close collaboration with partners like Palantir and in meeting that moment we are rebuilding our underwriting process on AIG's ontology with generative AI logic agents and automation reducing the length of aspects of our underwriting process from one month down to one day the insurance industry in the United States is primarily regulated at the state level rather than the federal level this is contributed to a lack of uniform data standards which can lead to data discrepancies across brokers, malformed PDF documents and Excel files and legacy technologies which require a complex data extraction so let me introduce you to the world of the underwriter due to disparate often unstructured nature of the data that the underwriters work with inefficiencies have existed in this process for decades and these have been obstacles to scaling growth underwriters work through large amounts of data across multiple sources to help them assess risk and determine coverage this data comes from brokers from clients and from ministry data sources all in different formats usually requiring manual review so typically an underwriter would have to review five to ten different complex documents comprising up to 100 pages retrieving reviewing and evaluating this data amounts to weeks of work per submission so the result of this highly manual error-prim process is that it takes up to three to four weeks for an underwriter to complete a submission this cycle time makes it nearly impossible for us to get to every submission we receive and most importantly that speed is critical to our business our competitors are also quoting for the same opportunities so when in the race means when in the client so we have to move faster without sacrificing the quality of our execution and this is the mission our team has undertaken with partners like Palantir our objective is simple accelerate growth at scale with rapid review at maximum quality for every submission we receive this wasn't a question of replacing the operator our underwriters have valuable expertise and years worth of experience to give a gives AIG its edge the issue was that they were spending 90% of their valuable time on retrieval extraction and manual entry of data distracting them from what matters most power by AIG's ontology underwriter assistance mitigates these repetitive processes deploying automations to refocus the underwriter on the actions and decisions that uniquely require their expertise core to this mission we've created a framework of five key principles to maintain a disciplined approach to applying Gen AI to our underwriting process first we targeted a single Gen AI use case we are focused on solving a real core immediate business challenge versus experimenting with Gen AI in non-core areas of the company second we co-created the solution with our business teams we wanted to ensure the solution we built aligned with real world workflows so we collaborated with various business units in the company to create a tailored solution third we adopted a human in the loop philosophy the underwriters at the heart of our business and Gen AI strategy they are the key decision maker and we created a tool to enhance their human expertise not replace them fourth we adopted an agentic modular architecture this allows us to both easily integrate and adopt new technology solutions because as we all know this technology and the models are rapidly developing and we wanted to create a foundation that would allow us to adapt and change as the regulatory and technology landscapes continue to evolve and finally we measure what matters our investments in these new tools are measured against predefined metrics underwriter assistance delivers three main capabilities first is ingestion so we automate the extraction of roughly 100 attributes that drive the underwriter's decision time from hundreds of data sources and files PDFs databases excel files and more and this turns days and weeks of underwriter work to minutes allowing us to feasibly process thousands of submissions in parallel second is augmentation tools in our ontology enable us to automatically search across internal and external data sources for relevant context and enrich and validate the content of the submission information and then finally prioritization we provide the underwriter additional information to assist them in prioritizing their valuable time on incoming submissions so let me bring to life what I've been talking about through a real example let's say underwriter assistance is looking for a client's total twenty twenty four revenue which is one of the roughly hundred data fields we need for underwriting in our rag framework we would generate a prompt in a query for total revenue the query then returns relevant context in this case the twenty twenty four income statement thereby limiting the vectors the large language model can actually search for the answer next we send both the prompt and the relevant context to the large language model the large language model then generates a response including the source document chunk from which the twenty twenty four revenue was found which is then reviewed confirmed or corrected by our underwriter or as we call them the human and the loop therefore back in the seat of the underwriter this approach substantially minimizes hallucinations by limiting the source context for the large language model it also drives better efficiency in terms of response time and token cost so with the assistance of volunteer and others we built an AI enabled system for the next era of AIG I'm incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished in deploying underwriter assistance to recap we were successful and we are expanding the implementation to other areas of our North America business we demonstrated a three to four week underwriting timeline review for each submission could be reduced down to less than one day with additional underwriter capacity this unlock can enable AIG to review 100% of the relevant submissions we received we consistently achieved over a 90% data quality accuracy rate compared to our manual input process and critically our bind to submit ratio in our pilot actually increased indicating that organic growth is possible without any increase whatsoever in submission flow so by increasing our underwriter capacity from two to five X providers such as Palantir have helped us unlock an opportunity to accelerate our potential growth it's a new era for AIG achieving transformation that impacts all of our stakeholders our customers get better accuracy and their policy and coverage more accurate rating and pricing in their specific risks and improved responsiveness our distribution partners get quicker response times on all of our submissions and more consistent underwriting decisions and pricing thus translating to a more productive relationship and our colleagues have more time and less of the work that they don't want to do like data wrangling and more of the work they do want to do like analyzing risk and engaging with our broker partners and our clients I'm extremely proud to be pushing the perimeter of the insurance industry in the underwriter assistant system the ability to rapidly increase speed and accuracy of critical decision making is going to have a profound effect on our business over time we're thankful to our partners such as Palantir for their help to build and deploy the speed with speed ambition and a laser focus on value to AIG and this is just the beginning thank you please welcome IT director at the Bureau of Medical Services US Department of State Alan Lewis hey good morning everyone I'm Alan Lewis I'm responsible for the technology enabling the US Department of States medical program we provide primary preventive and emergency health care to US government employees and their families stationed at diplomatic posts all over the world we have over 200 clinics in 170 countries with 1500 staff caring for 70,000 patients we maintain emergency medical kids and countermeasures deploy protective medicine providers to austere and high risk environments provide specialized medical transport and run comprehensive lab pharmaceutical and mental health programs today I'm going to tell you a story of digital transformation chapter one during the COVID pandemic while most of the world quarantined we shifted to 24-7 operations and executed over 600 missions costing nearly 300 million dollars these missions included repatriation of US citizens distributing protective and test equipment medically evacuating patients and ultimately delivering and administering the vaccine to every post we did all of this rather ineligently unstructured and unnormalized spreadsheets and PowerPoint slides after I sat on the early task force in the middle of the night and edited this multi-leg flight actinerary across three times in three time zones in Excel that you see here I reached out to Palantir for help when we surveyed our operations we realized we were making decisions on an incomplete understanding of our information environment these decisions in the middle of a contingency our crisis are under significant time pressure with lives on the line thus we were accepting risks to our mission and to our force that we were unaware of because we couldn't compile all the variables in time in total we found 30 use cases for data aggregation analytics and process automation today that program has 60 production applications for the end-to-end lifecycle of our emergency medical program and every functional domain of our broader operations we can manage clinical credentials, actively identify threats or events that we need to respond to plan and track all of our training and operations and allocate resources in a data informed manner now when strikes are reported near a nuclear facility in Ukraine we can immediately ascertain how many iodine tablets are in Kiev. Chapter two in 2023 more than a decade after the majority of US healthcare systems had adopted electronic health records we were still documenting all of our clinical encounters on paper. Pickedured here is a small fraction of former employee charts that are stored for up to 30 years in a warehouse every time a current employee moves they hand carry their chart to the new post. Meanwhile the third attempt over 15 years to deploy our own electronic health record faltered. I took over the project and concluded that one of the fundamental issues we were facing is that commercial EHRs are designed to optimize billing and insurance. We do neither of those things. Additionally we have highly specialized workflow such as helping employees with medical conditions identify the right post equipped to support them. So we decided to build on our Foundry Infrastructure to create a spoke non-standard EHR with the goals on screen. We put the first application for that into production in three months reducing the time it takes to clear candidates to the foreign service from 60 days down to 12. We launched the Minimovile product of the provider portal in under a year saving $100 million of the taxpayers dollar and we recently deployed our first AIP workflow bringing us from analog to AI in 18 months. Now every single encounter that we do is documented digitally and new employees to the department will never see a paper chart. Next I'm going to show you how these two platforms working conjunction to perform our highest risk mission a bio containment medical evacuation of a patient with a highly infectious disease. Starting in axiom our enterprise data management platform a small team of threat analysts monitor emerging epidemiological and kinetic threats near our people posts and planes. So for example when a warehouse in Lebanon explodes there is a limited amount of time for us to respond and put together a relevant plan. Therefore we must proactively monitor developing situations around the world which generates thousands of data points. In this scenario the system alerts the analysts of multiple infectious disease reports after aggregating various open source feeds identifying an early outbreak near one of our posts. The analyst leverages AIP to broaden their search allowing them to provide global coverage of these very niche focus areas. After assessing the legitimacy and the severity of these events we need to rapidly disseminate an easily digestible report to the impacted posts. The report is generated with a proposed analysis that the user can edit apply the applied the appropriate level of classification and send out. So now in this scenario the nearby health unit receives this report and they'll step up precautionary measures and screening in response. Now at the health unit our patient Jane presents with flu-like symptoms and the staff is able to quickly pull up the patient's chart. Now we're going to document this clinical encounter. I'm going to state the obvious here but only one person can possess a physical chart at any given time. We're demonstrating this behind me sequentially but in practice the admin staff can update the demographics while the nurse documents vitals update immunization records and logs the chief complaint all while the provider conducts the remainder of the encounter. This is an improvement to the patient experience the administrative efficiency of the visit and it's crucially important in maintaining accountability security and integrity of the patient's record. I also want to point out that my team working on these encounters was six people none of whom come from a technical background and Palantir didn't actually build them. What we built was a tool that normalizes clinical encounters into their base components that are then added and arranged to create a multitude of encounter types and my clinicians did most of the configuration. At the end of the encounter a lab test is ordered. The health unit's inventory which is maintained in axiom is checked to make sure that the equipment is available and the expendable items for the test are ready so that only available tests can be ordered. Now the lab technicians scans the results to be extracted and loaded into the patient's record. As this information is pulled out the system checks against a list of ordering providers to pair the result to the open encounters. Known labs also tracked in axiom are identified and critical or abnormal results are automatically flagged. Time manually entering results is saved and human error is minimized. The provider then consults axiom's medical capabilities information application to find a preferred host nation resource for additional testing that's unavailable in the health unit. These external labs would be uploaded and processed similarly to the internal lab. Now a week later Jane returns worst condition with new symptoms and she discloses travel to the outbreak area identified in the original report. We make a referral to our infectious disease specialist in DC who now with this capability can review the chart and all the lab results in real time with the consulting provider. The specialist deems Jane a patient under investigation and recommends immediate Medevac. Now the provider is initiating a Medevac from the portal. This sends all of the required information to coordinators across a multitude of functions to begin planning. The full chart patient's history all previously unacceptable are securely shared with our Air ambulance vendor to ensure continuity of care throughout their trip. Historically we had to make a trade-off here between insecurity transmitting patient information or excluding potentially pertinent information that the provider needs. Sometimes this meant taping a physical copy of the records to the patient's chest on their way out. After planning the itinerary six hours later the aircraft is en route to evacuate Jane. The aviation operation is tracked live to enable real-time coordination and communications with the receiving hospital and other stakeholders. Now Jane is safely back in the United States to receive care at a specialty facility. This generates substantial records that exist outside of our platform. When there's a delay in uploading this external care the post provider does not know or has to rely on the patient to know what occurred such as new medications. They can't safely adequately address complications upon return with this delay. Now with minimal manual entry we can use AIP to tag index and parse any paper record generated outside of our practice to become part of the chart before they return to post. We use upstream data sources such as medication lifts from our e-prescription service to set boundaries on AIP so that only structured, cleaned and vetted data is presented to the user for addition to the chart. In the next chapter we planted deploy a patient portal by the end of this year built entirely in foundry to 50,000 users. In parallel we're developing our next round of AIP use cases such as scheduling and ambient clinical intelligence to match or surpass a Western standard of care for all of our patients regardless of what corner of the world they're serving the country in. That's the story of how we're improving its saving lives leveraging foundry and IP. Thanks for listening. Please welcome Executive Vice Presidents and Chief Information Officer at Hertz, Tim Langley Hawthorne. Good morning everyone. I was sitting in this audience three years ago and really happy to be here today. Share with you all a little bit about what we're building with foundry and what we're building and what we have built with foundry to generate and build what we call our fleet operating system at Hertz. Hopefully some of you have rangered cars before. Sure you've heard of us. We pioneered this business. We've been business more than a hundred years and we are the most recognizable brand in the world in Carrentour. We operate a fleet of more than half a million vehicles from more than 11,000 locations and across 160 countries around the world. This is a scale business. And in partnership with Palantir we've been focusing around fleet management and workforce management and I'll give you some demos today some of the things we've built and some of the things we're building. This is all around our purpose and our mission for our customers which is making sure we have the right car at the right place at the right time. So come in with me to Carrents and I'll take you a little bit behind the scenes this morning of some of the things you probably don't know go on behind the scenes. So think about the point when you return the car and the next person picks up the car. There's a lot of things that have to be orchestrated during that period where we may need to do an oil change. We may need to change tires on the vehicle. We obviously have to clean it, right? We have to move cars around a lot. This is a quite a complex orchestrated activity that we try and condense to a short amount as time as we can. And why do we do that? Obviously we want efficiency, we want to minimise our maintenance cost, but more importantly we want to make sure that we have the car available for you that you've reserved. So here's a little bit of behind the scenes. You can see here one of our vehicle service associates that cleans the car. That's a fuel island. You can see the gas pumps there in the background. This is at our Atlanta location. You can see in the middle one of our transporters that actually moves the cars around the lot and moves it through those different activities that I talked to you about. And then you also can see here which will show a little bit of a demo shortly is a very lightweight app that we've built on Foundry and we've deployed on small cheap Android devices on our lots for our transporters. It is giving them the intelligence to do the next best action with each of those cars. This was an incredibly manual process previously and we'll talk a little bit more about that shortly. So let's zoom up. This is what we call our fleet control tower. You can see here all of our large US airport locations are represented here and we've got some AIP agents running there below. We've got an airport disruption agent running on the left and let's take a little dive down into there and see what's happening in Atlanta. So this agent has been running. It's been identifying potential issues with weather, flights, demand from customers and I think there's something that's happening in Atlanta with weather. You can see here times of returns, times of pickups. We have some staffing issues later in the day and in the middle here you can see this is a bird's eye view of our Atlanta location and the different areas and you can see we have some potential problems coming up here in returns and in cleaning. Front desk stalling seems fine and then down below you can see an almost near real-time flow of where the vehicles are moving through all these locations. This is just one location. You take this out to thousands of locations and hopefully you get an understanding of the complexity that we're trying to orchestrate better through the use of foundry. So let's go in and see a little bit what AIP is picked up here in Atlanta. You can see here that we've got some issues building later in the day around a dirty car backlog and the returns queue and it's all been driven by some weather events there that are not only impacting flights that are coming in but it's also impacting the ability for our customers to return their cars because the roads are all backed up coming into Atlanta. So what are we going to do about it? Let's look at some suggested actions. So what foundry is suggested here is that we move some employees away from front desk main counter and the exit gates into returns because we know we're going to have a surge of returns later in the day. We've also identified we need some overtime right we're going to need some folks to work a couple more hours in the day to be able to cope with these issues that are potentially building. We also have the ability to add human context and human in the loop information. Let's say we have one of our customer service representatives on the front counter it's her birthday today. I don't want her to have to work overtime. We can add that in and she would be removed from the logic around asking for additional overtime. Let's dive in and see how this actually shows up for the actual employees there on the lot and they will actually get in their app after we've run the orchestration you can see here in the app. They will get a notification that asks them would you like to work overtime? You can either accept or reject depending on what they do that will then get worked back into the model and then optimize the operation for the next several hours. Let's see what that did. You can now see our charts. We've moved some of the issues it was no longer all read there on backlogs. We've also seen that where we were read in returns and read in cleaning it's now amber. Now front desk has actually gone from green to amber but that's because remember we've moved staff out of the front desk into those other areas of the operation so we can more smoothly balance the workforce with the customer demand and those events that are going on. So what does this always mean? This is a connected fleet operating system and it really orchestrates customers, vehicles and a workforce. Those are the three critical components for business like ours on the ground to make sure that we can drive efficiency and we have clean vehicles available for when our customers want to pick them up. So for our customers this is all about making sure the car you reserved is there when you arrive. From a efficiency perspective it's bringing AI into an operation that was historically run on two-way radios. It was run on dispatches. It was run on people running around the lots talking to people rather than using an app to communicate that. And finally it's optimizing our labor and making sure we have the labor deployed to the parts of the operation are the most critical. And it's all in pursuit of our ultimate goal of right car right place right time. So speaking of which I actually have a task and this is related to right car at the right time. So I'm going to accept the task. I've been asked to move one of our Hertz Shelby GT500 Mustangs down here today to the AIPcon event. Only 25 of these vehicles have been produced and they honor 60 years of American Shelby manufacturing of these cars. We're going to break. I would love you to join me outside. This is a classic piece of American muscle car engineering. There's only 25 of them. You can rent it tomorrow at SFO if you like. I'd love to see everyone outside and see one of our Hertz Shelby Mustangs. Thank you. Hello everybody. Welcome back to AIPcon. This is the seventh. Yes you heard that right. Seventh edition of AIPcon. My name is Amit. I've been covering Pound here for the better part of five years now and I'm honored to once again go backstage at AIPcon. Now in the previous AIPcon the theme was really about agents and automation and this AIPcon is going to be more about connecting those concepts that have continued to gain momentum to a unified operating system for customers to get more value. And to help me do that I've got AIP lead with me Jack Dobson and customer engagement lead with me Nina Jacobson. Now Jack this is the seventh AIPcon. You've been a part of a couple of these. What has changed since last time? It feels like more than a couple but that way. I mean firstly great to have you back so excited to be back on backstage pass. What has changed honestly there is a reason we have made it to seven. I can't say much right away. We'll be going next tonight. We simply don't know yet but every single time we run one of these it's a new era. It is a new story. A new set of stories that our customers are telling and that is really the reason we are back for the seventh edition. A reminder all of AIPcon like you will have seen the keynote so far there are more key notes to come on the live stream but throughout the entire afternoon that you guys don't see at home all of the content is customer led. All of this event is driven by customers and the reason we put this event honest is those customers have new stories to tell. You mentioned agents and automation. Big part of this for me is really upping that ambition. People are talking about automating and building individual workflows. This time around we're seeing people connect those workflows into a true broader operating system for the enterprise. That is redefining decision making at the organizational level. I mean I'm talking about customer stories but Nina you are the queen of customer stories. You know everything that's going on AIPcon have you seen that same sort of era shift in our customers? Oh my goodness absolutely. So you know just right off the bat you know in terms of our you know second half of the day are interactive programming that is exclusive for our in-person attendees. We have the demo X1 the champions relay that I think are really pushing the limits in terms of you know what we're doing next with our customers. So for example our demo XBO I have never seen customers scale so fast in my entire time at Palantir. It's truly remarkable. And then also with the champions relay something that you know is is totally new to AIPcon were you know of course before you know we were very interested and invested in the transformation of organizations internally but now we're seeing a transformation of the industries so all of these organizations you know within you know manufacturing supply chain healthcare working together. So it's really cool to see not only do we see the value in the individual transformation but also the ecosystem as a whole. 100% and the amount of creativity that requires going to the theme is off the charts right. I mean we literally have an artist who is painted. On this stage and over there. It is pretty incredible so so speaking of creativity the the previous themes we've seen at Palantir AIPcon's space time. Shoes. This AIPcon is focusing on art and Dr. Carp at AIPcon number two said that LLM's large language models are like artist colonies. How does that relate to the theme of art at this AIPcon? Yeah it's a good cool back so so Dr. Carp famously referred to LLM's as these great artists and I think this was truly calling back to the idea that these LLMs are by the very nature they are generative. They are able to create this content but I think as we've seen very quickly like the LLM on its own is not the end of the story. You need the platform you need the framework around that logic engine as it were to truly drive value within the organization. So for us what we've actually seen is a shift from the creativity at the model level to the creativity brought about by our customers. Building with that logic, building with our platform and I think increasingly as people tackle bigger bolder use cases and build like bigger faster solutions to those problems the level of creativity that they are bringing to the table is incredible to see. So we always joke about Palantinty being a bit of an artist colony, a bunch of crazy artists, our customers everyone you see behind us a part of that community as well. Absolutely. And Nina you've been working with a lot of those customers. Any sense of the art that they're creating in terms of applications on Palantir? Yeah absolutely so I will say you know right off the bat you know creativity can only go so far if you don't have execution and so you know we all have you know developed this really strong you know execution base we've got operations nailed and now it's time to really get into you know what's next what's scaling. So you know I think it's it's really really interesting you know seeing the speed and then also the collaboration feed into that execution and then we can further iterate more into this amazing operating system that we're now seeing you know through AIPcon 7. Awesome. Yeah and the art that we're seeing just in the room and we have Palantir artists we have Palantir photographers showing off their art. I think it speaks to the level of creativity that the employees you guys have in this company that make the company as unique as it is today. 100% yeah I think Palantir has always been in place where from a tech standpoint the software does not like constrain our customers we don't force our customers to constrain to the software it's the other way around right you wouldn't force Dali to paint like Monet the same way you wouldn't force an organization to operate differently to its true core mission so we're actually going to have a set of customers join us here on backstage fast those of you who know the story will know what to expect but a whole set of new stories I'm super excited to see told. Awesome. Alright so let's get into some customers first up we have Amy Ritulo who is the chief data and AI officer at the Department of State. The department has been using Palantir to keep Americans safe in a variety of diverse and mission critical situations enabling some of the most impactful workflows to hear more let's take it to Nina and Amy. Awesome thanks a bit Amy thanks thanks so much for joining us so you know we saw the department of state represented through AIPcon today you know first off with Alan's keynote amazing amazing work so you know we're seeing full representation from Department of State today you know starting with the keynote all the way through our last session today of Champions Relay you know so excited to learn more about you know our work together throughout the day. Yeah thanks so much for having me it's been great to be here this is my first AIPcon the energy is incredible and I'm just really appreciative of being around people who are super excited to talk about the work they're doing and sharing their lessons learned. Yeah so Alan's presentation was great it's a great demonstration of how we're using the platform in some of our most important workflows across the department. That's awesome. Yeah so I know that he mentioned you know Orion and how powerful that's been and it got me thinking about you know he talked a lot about the origin story of that workflow and you know in our discussions you know prior to AIPcon you talked a lot about how the actual users of your platform are actually driving the development of that so we'd love to hear kind of more about how you know that process works at the Department of State. Yeah sure so at the department our mission is to make America safer stronger and more prosperous. We have diplomats who are delivering on that mission every day. They're maintaining relationships that have been built over decades they're doing that in over 190 countries they're working on thousands of policies and they're doing it in an increasingly complex global environment so when we first started our journey with Palantir we knew at the State Department that General of AI was going to be trans could transform how the State Department worked and so when we started this journey we knew a couple of things one is that we couldn't just build tech that was going to sit on shelves. Ben there done that right yeah and and the other thing we knew is that we had to build tech that was engaging with our partners and diplomats across the globe so we have been working with Palantir to start our journey of developing a generative AI chatbot that is called State Chat it is in a secure safe environment that allows our department employees across the globe to put in sensitive department specific data. We built that based on an incredible amount of user feedback so we had super users tell us how they're using it and what they want to see in it in the future. We did surveys across our entire user platform and we just finished a feature ranking exercise where we asked users we got responses from over 700 users of what they wanted to see next. So when we're working so when we started about development when we started that development we also went out to our missions and embassies across the globe and said how do you want to use this technology and they told us we want to be able to you we want to be able to transcribe meeting notes our diplomats are going to bilateral and multilateral meetings every day almost every day they want to be able to transcribe their meeting notes and do it on the fly so when we worked with Palantir to build our mobile development we built it so that our diplomats can take a picture of their notes on their mobile phone they can then transcribe those ask state chat to summarize those notes draft an email and send it all while they're in their car on the way back to the embassy. That's really incredible. Yeah we have over 40,000 users in the platform and they're saving about two to three hours a week. And the fact that you're operating those complex environments I imagine that speed that time of then not only summarizing that information but then contextualizing it like connecting it to that broader ontology and enabling those change decisions downstream must be changing the way you operate right. Yeah for sure I mean we're really thinking about how to take this transformative technology and build it for our people we're not out there building state of the art AI what we're building is AI that fits into our workflows and fix it yeah and fits into how our employees work on a daily basis that's amazing. That's incredible there's almost a sense of democratization within your organization in terms of the actual development of tech. Yeah yeah it's great to see. Incredible well thank you Amy so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. Love it. Thank you Amy. Second up we have Sia Zadie who is the vice president of Digital Solutions at International. Now they begin using Palantir to build an application suite for Digital Dealer which enables their dealers to generate and connect more leads for vehicle owners. To hear more about that let's dig it over to Jack and Sia. Awesome Sia thank you so much for joining us on backstage fast to get yourself tell us a bit more about your work at International and a bit about the partnership that you guys have built with Palantir. Right so we are part of a trading group we have building buses and trucks with the solutions to support our customers there's a lot of transformation going on with the electrification autonomous and then part of that is also building up an ecosystem that can support our customers in a good way. Wow that's incredible so you mentioned that the ecosystem we talked about Digital Dealer this application you're rolling out tell us more about that workflow like with a problem that it's solving and I guess why was this the moment to go solve that yeah yeah so I'll give you a foundation level of information so if you talk about service department at the dealership there's a lot going on when a truck is broken down we ring that to the to the side and then diagnostic happens technician needs to support parts needs to be available so there are many silos or pieces moving parts and what we are doing together with Palantir is to rebuild up an orchestration and and aggregating all of the information so that we can actively connect with the customer bringing them before something happens and then schedule them so that it goes through in a smoother process yeah bringing efficiency for the customer dealers and also ourselves that's fascinating we just heard those of you watching on stream we just heard from hurts rental cars yes and it sounds kind of similar right where it's like you can predict some of those movements you can free-empt the action to be your customers the issues that need to be resolved and essentially then that customer journey is as fluid as seamless as possible and ultimately like improves the experience of your customers right so tell me a little bit about I mean I'm imagining like you've got dealerships all over the country right this is a massive scale of rollout actually delivering the solution so tell me a bit more about the journey of like how you've actually gone out deploying the solution and what about our partnership is enabled you to do that kind of rollout it's a lot about co-creation and really connecting to the real users so we are still on the journey so we started up with co-creating together with the dealers with the real users Palantir supported a lot really to connect how we can innovate and then also learn from every step we started with 12 dealers with 32 rooftops but as of today we are planning to expand it further and and the beautiful it is that yeah it's a it's a continuous improvement process we learn more we expand we have implemented some of the AI Jenny AI kids as well and then it's an automation journey which we are all very excited about of course 100% and maybe to wrap us up tell me a bit about like with all of that in mind how is that changing the way you think about the next use case the next challenge like is this getting you to move faster it's allowed you to go deeper but how's that changed the way you think about solving problems the international so two major part is bringing value to the customer of course by improving the experience because that's the differentiating part we are really obsessed about and that cannot happen without really understanding the pain points at the dealership so going away they're co-creating working together so that co-creation is good right well so yeah this is I'm leaving exciting good luck with the rollout it's still in progress as you mentioned super excited to have you on the show and enjoy the recipe I pick up thank you all thank you all right thank you so next up we have Allison Jenkins who is a senior technical product manager at GE Aerospace now GE has been focused on accelerated production and supply chains while also navigating compliance and different government restrictions to hear more about that let's take it over to Nina and Allison thanks to me awesome Allison thank you so much for joining us it's awesome to have you here thanks for having me Nina awesome so GE is an absolute tight-knum industry for decades you've been pushing the manufacturing and supply chain parameters you know two out of three military aircrafts are you know coming from GE and you guys were responsible for the first jet engine pretty incredible stuff so similar to Palantir you guys run a very lean operation how is that impacted not only your work in supply chain but also your partnership with us yeah absolutely I think one of the main things about Palantir and GE Aerospace being the lean industry is that it's a good alignment when we actually get into an engagement with Palantir so what it really means to me is that on a daily management standpoint we all work together to win the day to win the week to win the month and that's what our CEO has been asking for us to do is to have a lean culture and by having a quick iterative way of operating at Palantir it fits very well into the model of where we're trying to go to support our supply chain and improve day by day to address our biggest problems absolutely so in addition to running extremely lean you guys also operate at an insane you know just just just an insane metric so when you create sort of operational changes there's the potential to have this insane seismic shift and sometimes that can be very disruptive what's really exciting about our work together and our partnership is that you know we've addressed the speed and the agility at which you're able to then very like very quickly pivot so you know with that in mind what are you most excited to tackle next yes I think where we need to tackle next is how we're going to manage this internally Palantir away from the hobbits of Palantir if you will the developers who are fantastic shout out to Christian and Dox and Kate but we need to get to the point of having that internally that power of the hobbits that are in our Palantir in Foundry space and so we need to work on what is our strategy for our digital roadmap on how do we bring a single ontology how do we bring a single data layer when we have desperate systems and then how are we going to manage that from a digital aspects the traditional product management versus the new age AI prep work that we need to do and in order to do that we have to be able to talk about from a product management standpoint what's the right way to address enterprise data management what's the right way to address platform management and everything that we need to do on the ground to make sure that it's sustainable for the growth that we're seeing coming in from engine orders that's awesome and maybe to wrap us up so you're talking there about the program management which is of course critical how do you think that's different on Palantir compared to like I imagine obviously G.A.R.A.R.A. space all manner of software solutions and products out there but program management of course still is of critical importance how do you think about that differently when you're building a Palantir? Yeah I think part of what's a little different is when you have to have one foundry ontology layer when you come from a traditional product stack standpoint you're thinking alignment directly to your business users for a specific product rather than how does it work across the entire landscape so it's forcing these internal conversations for us to be able to say okay how are we going to do that across all of our products which now you know foundry wherever that that fits yeah versus just delivering for your one subsect of the business to address a specific problem we need to do it across our supply chain and that's a very difficult task I think 100% but that's what comes with building a new operating system right as you redefine decision-making like it's not an easy task but it's one journey that we're super excited to be on with you absolutely awesome thank you so much thank you for having me all right thank you Allison next up we have Brent trolling who is the sector vice president of strategic growth at north rubb rummage now north group has been using pouches warps the platform to rein industrialize their own defense manufacturing efforts and to hear a lot more about that let's get to Jack and Brent Brent thank you so much for joining us super excited to have you here on the show I want to start with a little bit of a story right your journey with Palantir it starts in kind of a fun way right a dissimilar event to a IP con that we're at right now right now tell us all about how you came to be connected so actually we've been working with Palantir for a couple years on our mission side working on the government side doing distributed solutions for the warfighters we've been developing projects that we're working on together and at one point I was asked to go to the Palantir Pre by your commercial side I was always familiar with the government side so I went up to New York City December 23 and it was really interesting to me all the applications from the different companies that were there using Palantir to improve their processes are back in processes and someone on my team actually saw me on YouTube and they texted me the next morning they said hey I saw you on YouTube we're really interested in proving our processes and manufacturing supply chain and I said I had the same impression walking through the Palantir Pre so we got back and we figured out some projects that we could do we work with our counterparts in Palantir to find these projects and pilots and we've been working on these for a year and a half now in terms of improving supply chain and production efficiency for us that is awesome you literally became the influencer that sort of influence this whole thing right that's brilliant yeah absolutely mad so I mean look people know North America I think you guys are the tip of the spear when it comes to empowering the warfighter especially from a hardware standpoint right and then you've got Palantir on the software side of things like equally mission driven but focusing on sort of a different like part of that mission right so with you guys fully focused on hardware us on software tell me about that partnership like how do we come together and what's unique about the way we know we actually deliver full systems right so full system solutions got decades doing that air and space under sea things like to be 21 things like James what space teleco things like radars that I work on so I think the real mix of Palantir is we both really are focused on the mission so that's a strength between us and we both bring complimentary efforts into the projects that we're working on so very strong there's a lot of technical respect I see between our smiths between the Northrop rummaging the Palantir smiths are working side by side to really solve the warfighters most pressing problems and do that in a very you know very fast with the sense of urgency so there's a very complimentary and really appreciate Palantir's experience and and what they bring in terms of urgency and software to our system that's brilliant and then maybe looking to the future right with that partnership in place and us both focused on that mission how does that change the way you guys think about the next decision you made the next work for you invest in like how does that change the way you solve problems well because what's happening is it's becoming much more complex and in solutions need to be done much quicker so how we're thinking about it is really real proliferation of sensors and systems and proliferation of data sources whether it be our missions or on the operational floor and so how do we leverage that data this complex data and quickly see the patterns and get to the right decisions and so with us for the warfighter or in our pretty seen products that's our partnership with Palantir and that would that's where we see the future going I think it's a very exciting time exciting time for me as an engineer yeah in just the pace is picked up and really enjoy the partnership that is absolutely awesome two titans of the industry coming together right yeah yeah it's brilliant well Brent thank you so much for joining us excited to see the rest of the day that I think I'm great thank you Brent next up we have Joe Putra who is the development strategist at Kavanaugh Kavanaugh is a constructive construction company that's undergone a massive effort to build an operating system to connect the fabric of their business in construction on Palantir to hear more let's take it over to Jack and Joe also Joe thank you so much for joining us it's great segue actually just hearing from Brent from Nordrup we talked a little bit about the journey of how he came to be working with Palantir right I just love the story of how Kavanaugh came together with Palantir and like truly went about your sort of development journey in a very very different way right a really innovative way so tell me a bit more about the journey of like some of the work was you deployed and like that mindset that you've had in terms of approach yeah so our Palantir journey started like many others with use cases right so tying together our legacy software is building things like cost reports equipment utilization metrics but we quickly realized that our manual processes and legacy data is actually holding us back yeah so construction and allergy but we're trying to build on a bad foundation we actually took a step back and asked ourselves what would it look like we just built this thing right from the ground up completely in Foundry so long story short that's exactly what we did so this January we partnered with Palantir for six month intensive engagement wow transform our construction division and the momentum's been so strong we actually just extended that engagement with FTEs another six months so we're all in so much so that every other software must justify its existence and we've actually had some instances where we've replaced third-party software before we were able to even roll it out or make the first payment we just built it in Foundry that's incredible actually jump me off exactly that point I'd love to hear one of those stories right in terms of these workflows that point you said around every piece of software must justify its existence I remember you told me a little bit about one of the workflows I think of some HR software that was being explored right and tell me the story of how you came to prove that hey maybe Palantir's up to the task here yeah it's really funny because a lot of the things we do we treat as a lot of the inputs we make are actually outputs so when you a lot of people will do an org chart or they will do a cruise but an org chart is actually an output of a properly organized employee database and so we've been able to prove out that if you just manage all your employees holistically in Foundry you can just output a beautiful org chart that's amazing we've actually built a lot of workflows like truck dispatch equipment dispatch tool rentals and things like that we're actually going so far as now is replacing traditional ERP functions like payroll AP AR procurement and we're actually managing the development rollout of our tools in Foundry itself so we're not just building tools for for the officer for managers we're actually folks on making the people on sites lives a lot easier to so at the center of our operating system is actually tool we're calling site 360 so that's where field actions happen that's the kinetic layer that's going to allow field staff to do things like plan their activities manager to cruise book trucks order material either costing and approvals all in Foundry on site and actually complementing site 360 we built another app we're really excited about it's our forward-facing employee app and it's powered by Foundry OSDK so actually rolling it out to the App Store in the next couple days for testing but that's where employees are going to be able to do things like see their upcoming shifts punch in punch out book time off update their personal information right in Foundry from their phone and the best part about building this way the holistic ontology the pure ontology is that you know when you go all in the information just flows so in 12 months we went from one user in Foundry to 100 and we're about to roll out to all 1200 employees in the next couple months with Kavanaugh Connect so we went from paper to Palantir and just over a year that's incredible that is brilliant I mean that note you mentioned there of going all in right like a lot of companies obviously we work with they talk about consolidation they talk about harmonization you guys just like this is now the platform this is the OS this is a foundation on which we're building and maybe just to wrap us up like looking to the future how does that change the way because I mean you've really been focused on the decision-maker right people that are literally handling the trucks and like on the construction site are being enabled to build yes in the platform so how does that change the way you think about the next use case yeah we're we're really field focused we're just trying to make everyone's lives easier so the organization seeing the power of Foundry the owners Jeff and Laurie Kavanaugh are 100% committed we're not just streamlining our operations like we feel like we truly are enabling them and in by doing so we're revolutionizing construction we really mean that like by building holistically we're actually fast-tracking operational AI we're actually already starting to see the intelligence layer the automation takes shape so Palantir is not just making that possible when you build this way when you go all in it's inevitable beautiful well Joe thank you so much for sharing that story I'm excited to keep track of you guys you guys are absolutely going to the moon this is brilliant thank you so much Joe for joining us thank you Joe thank you we still have a bunch of keynotes left at AIP con Jack what can we expect who what can we expect it's already been a bad day I don't know if you guys can hear on the stream some of the engine revs going on behind I mentioned we had hurts can they they've got one of only 25 limited edition shellbees out there like red it like people exploring people are revving that engine there is a lot more where that came you're a car guy you like I have a car guys like if I'm not racing I'm here telling these stories right so no that means so far it's been brilliant obviously if you missed it rewind watch some of those keynotes but coming up I think prevailing the theme I want to land and actually Joe put it perfectly with Kavanaugh it's not just a case of redefining the organization it's not just one company each of our customers up on this stage are really thinking at the level of the industry we've got city wealth coming up they are transforming wealth management it's not just transforming city transforming the entire industry and Joe is going to come out pretty fighting in terms of this is powerful stuff they are equally all in as Joe from Kavanaugh mentioned I am super excited to see more of those stories where people are thinking not just at the scale of their company but the industry as a whole no absolutely and I'll say like you know with with in terms of the you know the afternoon sessions the two big themes that I keep seeing is you know this incredible driver as it as it pertains to time and this go big plan so in terms of time you know we saw you know with Alan on the Department of States that their keynote paper to a completely digital EHR 18 months absolutely incredible unheard of absolutely incredible and then in terms of go bigger I mean we saw her it's you know just up on the stage you know just a few moments ago 560 thousand cars in over 11,000 locations unbelievable all the tracks and ontology and in insane and then you know to pivot back to department state a hundred million dollars in cost savings wow it's incredible I think the scale is mad and we've taught a number of like different themes over these events like we've gone from time and the speed we've gone to space and really increasing the scale I feel like this artist colony theme is really releasing releasing all inhibitions right it's really allowing our customers to create at the pace and the drive and the sort of the pure ambition that they hold right and it goes back to that same point of like customers increasing it coming to us like what about this what about trying this and literally pushing the perimeter of product but that is about being aligned to the mission right it's like your product is already giving me that foundation I want to go further I want to go deeper and that is that creativity that inhibits basically allows for this artist community behind me so I mean Dr. Carp was speaking about this just recently about the idea that customers want to do more and the reason they want to do more is because they see results he says they have the burden of value creation as a engineer and pounder what does it mean to actually create value for customers and only get paid if you actually create value true I mean if I only get paid if I create value that's how it works no honestly I think this is something that's very special about a pounder it's the reason I've been here for effectively my whole career yeah I like the fact that every team I work with every problem I work on you feel the ownership of the outcome like my customers wins are my wins my customers losses are my losses and that's not every software company no 100% we talked about the forward deployed nature we had a bit of that on the pre show earlier again rewind if you missed it but these customers they partner with us because they're not just getting software they're getting a mindset shift a change in an approach to problem solving which means not only you have the best tech and the best people I may be a little bit biased but I think that's true but importantly those people will take your outcomes as their own and that is a level of ownership a level of accountability that enables incredible things I mean you've seen that with some of the sessions just a icon absolutely absolutely and I think also something to really you know underlying here is you know obviously we have so much you know stake in in our customer success you know we are all extremely mission driven organizations you know we're very like-minded you know but I think there's also this you know really important factor of you know we're not selling them this cookie cutter you know piece of software it is complete as you know similar to artists we don't conform and either do our customers and so you know there's this you know we're we're constantly evolving our technology to suit their needs because they are the experts they are the ones on the ground you know furthering the mission 100% and with that I think we're going to watch some more artists take to the stage we will see you guys next time on Poundters AAP con thank you everyone for joining the energy here is electric we'll see you guys they tune don't go anywhere they tune ahead of data analytics and innovation at city well Joe banana hey guys good afternoon hard to top the Shelby but I'll do my best three things before I get started one I joined city wealth about nine months ago two I came here to revolutionize and disrupt wealth management as we know it if you are one of my competitors you should fear us because I am about to crush you full stop okay so first let me tell you a little bit about city in terms of the brand how long we've been around spend a couple hundred years of this business we are super global we're in over a hundred different countries we serve as some of the world's change makers I'll call them the billionaires of the world that have families in different jurisdictions investments all over the place and run businesses and companies across the globe we also have over a million clients a million dollar households all over the world as well we move money around the planet five trillion dollars a day equal to sort of Germany's GDP but the reality is is it super fragmented our systems are archaic slow and honestly this story is less about sort of analytics and anomaly detection it's more about what I'll call intelligent automation optimization and synchronization at scale you're a client of ours your DNA sits in like 55 to a hundred different systems so your first name your last name your birthday investment objectives risk tolerance you name it is all fragmented invest guess what if you make an address change like literally log online it goes to a human who has to log into 55 systems to update it that's not gonna work okay but income's volunteer and I only work with cutting-edge partners and I'm as arrogant as you know some of the volunteer folks were day one to be honest with you they said listen we're gonna tell you things that you don't want to hear similar to what Alex said in the beginning and if you don't want to work with us we're not the right partner I said game on let's go so anyway let me get to the reality of what's going on here so less about slides more demo than anything else so effectively we're starting with all of our reference data so think about client data securities in our world so think of Apple technology to this sector industry we have real-time prices corporate action stocks splits and all that fun stuff we're putting all that into the DNA of foundry and our ontology what you see in front of you is a bit of a cockpit so I can see real time as customers open up accounts as new securities come in the market or you know an event like a stock split is taking place but really let me dig into sort of like all the stuff that's happening so what you see here as well is a bit of like how many accounts are getting opened on the fly people making deposited deposits moving money at the lower right-hand corner you see us bringing together that client DNA in a single place my team alone is probably in 14 countries so it's even getting them to sort of synchronize and sort of align to do analytics and cool things like AI it's a bit tough I'm gonna click into the experience now around opening an account what you'll see on the page is a bunch of things happening so when you log into a system and you sort of put in all of your information you know effectively what's happening is a bunch of signals are taking place and we're automating each and every process of the account opening life cycle but today that's manual humans going in to system by system by system I'll show you a deeper example in a second imagine you're that client and you come online you upload your passport you fill out like the seven questions it comes to a person well behind the scenes you know a couple things one we have to validate your address to make sure it's a legal address and in the US we might have to send it to a database Palantir is actually shooting and streaming events real time and then coming back and saying yes it's also streaming events to our KYC systems to make sure this isn't like a terrorist known location or something or or other it's also then invoking potentially a docu sign to actually send out to the client systematically so when the client signals back it comes back and it's lifting the data off the passport and in a hundred different countries all across the globe so this sort of process would take like nine days now it takes like seconds so it's pretty instantaneous and that's just one example let me show you a little bit more I'm now going to show you sort of the end-to-end process going across the top what you'll see is a bunch of activities so you see one through eight and what you see going down in the bottom is all these sort of services that I just mentioned so within each of the activities there could be over a hundred processes across 19 different systems so the green checks means hey it's processing real time and any any time there's sort of an issue maybe the passport didn't get read correctly or maybe the person's waiting on you know clicking on the docu sign we're sort of getting alerted and ultimately until when it's complete what's really cool here though is this is the first time ever like anyone's even seen the end-to-end process it took Palantir to come in to actually the two people that's next to each other didn't even realize like oh wow I didn't know that if you put this extra data upstream or you had to drop down it impacted me so now we can see side-by-side all of the processes and effectively we took out you know nine days into minutes and you know 50 people sometimes into like one single person we replaced pretty much all the makers we still have some checkers but this automation at scale we're looking at every single workflow possible and this allows us to build even new sort of capabilities and new online services what you see here we call it the GFCM it's our global federated client master so think of that as my DNA all the things I just said first name last name birthday investment objectives risk tolerance we're deeply integrated into all of our systems think of this like iCloud with your iPhones the easiest analogy right so you log in you have your iPhone you have an iPad you have a MacBook you go on vacation and maybe you log into some third party I you know iCloud you make a one-change this thing synchronizes it all and guess what some of these old school systems it's like hey this many characters that only can handle blah blah blah blah blah will balance here orchestrates that entire synchronization process which is pretty slick so for us like you know having people go through system by system is you know gone and those days are over and as of you know palantir synchronizing it is is the cool thing here let me show you a little bit more about how we bring this data together in depth because it's pretty complicated given that we're in 100 countries and if you're that family that has global DNA and your kids have an account with us in the u.s. and you have a family office in Singapore we're bringing it together what's really cool on the right hand side is the power that I can now bring so if you think about a financial advisor who has a thousand clients how do I know that you have Facebook that's downgraded abomacuring CD come and do it your birthday and guess what you live in California maybe there's a wildfire going on well I can actually stream all these events and prioritize and rank every single one and effectively to the financial advisor say here's who you should talk to and here's what you should talk to them about today and oh by the way we're invoking AI models to write messages in elementary school middle school and high school versions and depending how you respond in different languages I can actually track and trace so when you watch Netflix and you watch Rocky it's 1980s celestial own action it learns and maybe it's Rocky 2 or maybe it's Rambo maybe not but effectively I know what to serve you up less and what not to serve you so over on the right you'll see a bunch of next best actions for an individual client as an example these processes to be honest with you have allowed us to decrease like speed to market by at least 90% when it comes to sort of onboarding accounts doing KYC checks bring in new securities into the marketplace it's reduced massive friction in the system and the ecosystem there I'm taking us from defense and broken band-aids bubble gum and duct tape to offense and how do we use this data to inform our advisors and make them go faster it's like Superman or superwoman I'm just giving them a cape to actually know what to talk to their clients about so like I said and like Alex said I came to dominate crush and annihilate so if you're JP Morgan Merrill Lynch Morgan Stanley sorry all done please welcome chief executive officer at teletracking Christopher Johnson good morning Chris Johnson at teletracking technology CEO today I'm excited to announce our strategic partnership with Palantir the transform healthcare operations founded in 1991 teletracking is a healthcare technology company that works with over 150 health systems globally over our three decades we defined what would become an industry patient flow and capacity management software our logistics platform operations IQ helps hospitals and health systems expand their capacity to care by improving patient flow optimizing capacity automating workflows and delivering real-time data-driven insights in a complex system like healthcare every second counts small improvements in visibility automation and coordination can drive a massive impact changing how and where patients receive their care our mission has always been clear to bend the cost curve of healthcare down while improving access and quality of care together with Palantir we are addressing the deep rooted inefficiencies of an eight trillion dollar industry that touches every human being on the planet inefficiencies that we can help reduce by targeting approximately $275 billion in global healthcare waste at 20% of the total GDP of the United States being spent on healthcare it is simply unsustainable we are solving for a macroeconomic problem that Warren Buffett famously said was a tapeworm on the U.S. economy by combining teletracking domain expertise and unique operational data with Palantir's AI and analytics power we're entering a new era one where hospitals and health systems can make informed AI-enabled decisions delivering quality and better care at better margins but this partnership isn't just about technology it's about two industry first with a shared mission to reimagine healthcare and to drive positive change in the world so with that said I'm excited to walk you through some of the new capabilities that we're building on our operations IQ platform this is a capability on operations IQ reimagined with Palantir together we're changing how patients access care how clinicians work how actionable intelligence becomes a true catalyst in driving healthcare forward we've all experienced long wait times long periods of unknowns about diagnosis or treatment and the uncertainty of navigating an incredibly complex system but there's growing momentum to make healthcare more accessible transparent patient centered now it's possible and quite frankly it's human to feel frustration with that complex system but still hold a deep admiration for the people within it because healthcare just isn't a system it is people it is a calling it's moments and it's personal so imagine this a patient in a lower acuity facility needs a hospital transfer we'll call him David he needs a specialty bed and equipment and his condition requires a teleciter monitoring upon arrival the process starts the way it still does too often today as we work around the world a fact sheet yes still a fax sent to a transfer center followed by a phone call from there a human agent manually extracts patient details identifies clinical needs hunts for a hospital bed and equipment an available physician willing and able to accept the patient it's slow it's manual and it happens 24 hours a day 365 days a year now imagine that process for hundreds of patients across dozens of facilities what you're looking at beside me is a better way it's enabled by technology informed by clinicians empowered by actionable intelligence with the new capability and operations IQ the same fact sheet is received but now within seconds actionable intelligence extracts the critical and logistical details specialized needs tell the sitter requirements diagnoses comorbidities details often are sometimes overlooked but critical to ensure a patient gets the right care at the first time with Intelli tracking beds are automatically identified that match the patient's need checks for the availability of the equipment and begins assembling all of the moving parts required for that transfer no manually entry no back and forth phone calls no delays from missed details or resource mismatches this is the future of real-time frictionless patient care a hospital or health system where staff are empowered and most importantly patients get the right care faster so here's something else that we put in new and we're especially excited about the system doesn't just suggest the next steps it takes them so let's listen to the call good morning this is an automated phone call from the transfer center on behalf of the patient may I speak with the house supervisor please good morning how can I assist you today I would like to inquire if Dr. Olivia Martinez is available to admit a patient David Thompson into her med surge service what is the patient coming in for he is a bariatric patient who has had a fever and cough for several days the diagnosis is likely pneumonia he will require the remainder of the workup when he arrives at the hospital additionally could you please confirm if a video monitoring system and a bariatric bed are available in the room okay so what you're seeing here is automated automated action the agent calls three physicians the first two to climb the third accepts no repetition no delays just consistent professional handle handle by technology but informed by clinical staff behind it all our agents are checking schedules reserving resources priorities are adjusted notifications and alerts are sent shared situational awareness across what is often today silo's this is how healing happens this is first of a con capability in the industry and critically but built with and critically it is built with human oversight transparency in the human and the loop so teams can step in escalate or override at any point with bed and equipment availability confirmed let's kick off the transfer so with a click of a button the system starts coordinating every step of David's transfer using real-time location systems RTLS and GPS tracking our system dispatches the ambulance to move the patient the transporter to receive them the environmental services worker to ensure that the room is ready in the biomedical engineer to ensure that the required equipment is on station and in the hospital room before he arrives this is true coordination no last-minute scramble phone calls delays in care as the patient arrives the four-worn care team is instantly notified the nurse nose the emitting physician knows everyone is aligned and care starts immediately and proactively we call this care traffic control making sure that the patient the room and the team are in the right place at the right time so throughout the process operations IQ is capturing key metrics how many calls the automated agent handled time de placement of wooded delays and escalation everything is measured and when you can measure these outcomes across an entire health system you move from isolated insights to full enterprise visibility and that's where real operational transformation happens just as important it frees up human staff to focus on what matters most clinical judgment complex coordination and compassionate care and just as importantly sometimes holding the hand of a patient at their weakest moment so what you're seeing today is only the beginning the technology will continue to evolve forecasting patient needs optimizing transfer timing predicting bottlenecks before they happen what you're seeing here in a simplicity is an integrated and interoperable platform that makes things move helping hospitals and health systems serve more patients with greater efficiency and improving margins bending the cost curve of health care down while improving access and quality of care so together with Palantir we're turning chaos into coordination guesswork into guidance and helping team shift from reactive to proactive this demo is a glimpse of what is possible when health care operations are infused with actionable intelligence automation and empathy and thank you for exploring this with us in the future thank you please welcome founder and chief executive officer at Bolt Ryan Braslow hi everyone I'm Ryan Braslow it's great to be here today we're gonna talk about Bolt and our partnership with Palantir this is a real full circle moment for me about 12 years ago some of my smartest computer science friends at Stanford invited me out to have lunch at Palantir and they're interning and it was literally right in this room so I was really cool to see that this is what we're gonna do this talk and that's right around the time that I was coming up with the idea for Bolt and so what is Bolt we are the pioneers of embedded one click check out we have a network of 80 million US shoppers who we can one click accelerate through your checkout without an additional button we've also pioneered fully managed checkout checkout OS which is an API driven checkout and have been pushing the envelope on what is possible with commerce check out as many of you know is a very tough thing notoriously a lot of our teammates were very early at Amazon and the world's largest company the number one thing that would make Bayeslis's face turn red was the checkout and so it's very tough it's very complex and we're excited to talk about what we're doing with Palantir here to take it to the next level to talk about the size of the problem we have a very big problem here you put in all of this work to get your users interested in your product aware of your brand to your site interested in your products they click checkout and at that step 70% of people fall off it's a $2 trillion problem in the US alone and literally over $10 trillion problem globally so this is clearly a very big problem Palantir is the leader in creating customer archetypes simulations AI we're the leader in eliminating checkout friction check out creating higher conversion and today we've partnered to solve that multi trillion dollar problem once and for all this involves a bolt score so as you can see value conscious coral cares about discounts and loyalty getting a good deal rewards he's very value conscious but not everybody is value conscious big ticket book she likes to shop a lot she wants to dissipate her spend she also cares a lot about loyalty but she's willing to pay up and make these big ticket purchases a lot like my ex girlfriend so we if you look at today's checkout this is your typical checkout from the world's largest e-commerce platform it's long arduous full of friction nobody wants to go through this experience 70% of people drop off at this experience this is the same way checkout has been since the 90s and nothing has changed I started my own e-commerce company around two companies bolt dot com and love dot com love is where love meets commerce where clean green everything store everything store for the conscientious consumer and so this is what bolt looks like on love dot com as we're rolling out these updates but simplified no extra clutter no extra options we eliminate the noise we know what the customer wants whether they want discounts bundles the payment methods that they prioritize their shipping preferences we show them the least amount of options to get them through checkout as fast as possible here you can see the comparison check out 1.0 versus check out 2.0 and it's pretty compelling okay so now let's peel back the onion a little bit this is our checkout 2.0 agent in partnership with Palantir we've built a simplified dashboard to do really what only a largest e-commerce company in the world does which is archetype their customers segment their customers sort through their data and create actionable insights and predictions about how different configurations to your payment stack and checkout stack and UX will affect your checkout we analyze site behavior transactional data and browser information historical information everything comes into this one system and gets bolt-on technology layered into it you see customer trends dynamic buying habits here on the bottom right you can see a conversion rate drop around your discount based customer archetype so your site's performing well but this archetype is has had a drop and so here's what happens next you click in you expand you see why this dip might be happening what suggestions we have for you and here's the part that really excites me you can double click a lot more details a lot more reasoning and so we make it very simple once you believe in our hypothesis we show you the expect conversion rate impact AOV impact all of your site metric impacts what we anticipate our recommended change would produce and then we make it very simple to implement literally one click to deploy and so when you go and deploy this as a business owner this is my favorite part you can see the entire checkout stack in work perfectly visualized and you can see how our new change is affecting your conversion literally in real time so once you've implemented that change we'll go ahead here we will implement it here we go I want to implement x y you can preview the changes you click that button and in real time we will show you how this actually looks like in your checkout so this is not just a UI this is your real checkout in the works with this new customization layered on in this case it's a dynamic bundling option for those discount oriented shoppers you don't want to give discounts to a non discount oriented shopper so this can be rolled out just for that archetype and then with one click here just like we pioneered one click checkout one click to deploy so now this is live on your site you can see all of the impacts of this the hypothesis the conclusions and so not only do we capture your data but Bolt has in a men's amount of data from our tenure history we have over 80 million shoppers on our network this is nearly half of all active US shoppers have checked out with Bolt before it opted in for a Bolt wallet so we have an unbelievable history and we later on the Bolt data with your data to give you an unprecedented predictive ability on how you can drive higher conversion we're the world's first intelligent checkout going from checkout 1.0 to check out 2.0 we can check us out at bolt.com slash intelligent checkout you can see the rest of our unbelievable payments act check out sack at bolt.com if anybody wants to get in touch with me very easy Ryan at bolt.com or Ryan at love.com and we are so excited to be partnering with Palantir on the next generation of checkout 2.0 our checkout is going to be live on store.palantir.com we're going to be powering all this epic Palantir slag that everybody wants to purchase after the conference and get geared up so thank you all for listening. Please welcome president and chief operating officer at Nebraska Medicine Dr. Michael Ash. Good morning everyone they said usually they saved the best for last I don't know why they stressed usually but that's okay but I do really appreciate the opportunity to talk about our journey and so Nebraska Medicine is an academic medical center located in Omaha Nebraska and we provide clinical services that aren't available anywhere else in the region and our goal is easy access to world class health care. A couple of years ago we were having challenges with operational efficiency cost as well as staffing it was really difficult for us to accept transfers from other health systems and really meet the needs of the broader community so we started looking for a partner that would help us create a new health system operating system that could really transform and rewrite the way that we do things and my mantra is build confidence earn trust so we reached out to the leading health systems across the country and one name kept being mentioned every single time which was palantir so we set up meetings with Drew and Jeremy and others and realized that they got it they got health care is too important to not transform to better serve people and so we agreed to go together part of that build confidence earn trust they made it very clear that we could protect our patient data keep it separate from others and really work together to transform so we set the battle cry of must go faster and boy have we in fact we've been using the term a palantir unit of time and that represents when we're driving value and less than an hour if you look at the revenue cycle we generated an appeals letter and less than an hour and submitted it successfully to the insurance company in about 90 minutes total we got estimates of rewriting the supply chain application and we were told it would take two and a half to three months in 46 minutes they had a live product inclusive of machine learning and AI this is allowing us to have real-time solution decision making that is allowing us to think differently on how we take on challenges within the health system in fact we renamed forward deployment engineers forward success engineers because they're really helping us engineer a more successful way to get things done within our system we started with staffing and capacity management staffing we needed a way to dynamically adjust the number of nurses taking care of patients based on acuity we also wanted to factor in their preferences and taken consideration the higher cost of agency nurses and premium pay this as well as other efforts across our health system we've been able to achieve less than 50% nurse turnover compared to national averages if you look at our capacity management efforts to short length of stay and get patients out of the hospital earlier and I'll talk more about this in a second we saw a 2100% increase use of our discharge lounge you heard me correctly greater than a 2000% improvement this is resulted to the equivalent of adding another unit to our hospital very transformational for sure as I said we provide services that no one else does and because two years ago 18 months ago in fact when we started with Palantir we had capacity constraints greater than 90% average daily census every single day and so those efforts to reduce and improve throughput through the hospital like I said one unit 35 additional beds has now allowed us to see a 13% increase in transfers so I'm gonna walk you through that demonstration now the system is going and looking at admissions through our emergency room direct admissions as well as discharges and bringing forward patients that meet defined criteria based on ours urgent emergent cases we always take them but urgent cases where there may be able to be served somewhere else in the community we may not have the capacity so if we drill in on Sally Sally's here for what means to be transferred a tab or a multidisciplinary high complex surgery we can drill in and look at the bigger picture all of the admissions all of the discharges and pick Sally and get more information says why she needs to be transferred and gives us minute by minute in fact it's a 95% discharge prediction accuracy that is allowing us to more confidently accept patients transferred improving quality and safety as well as a better experience for them and piece for their family that they know that they're gonna receive the care they deserve so a tab or is a trans catheter aortic valve replacement and it's not just a simple of sliding in into an OR you need a special hybrid room because it involves both cardiologists as well as a cardiothoracic surgeon as well as special radiology equipment so it's not a matter of just drag and drop it actually reads through the entire chart and looks through what else might be planned what are comorbidities what are the risk factors then it compares it to that unique surgeons average time for similar cases in this case 57 similar cases predicted a two hour and seven minute case time we can then go back and start staffing that team figure out think of your fantasy baseball team is you want to have the right certification the right training and build out not only that case but you have the move other people around on the schedule so make sure that you have people with the right skills and they get to do the cases that they want to do as well and if you drill into that tab or you can see the other cases they had to be moved to make room we'll talk about that baseball metaphor with the baseball cards this looks at our HR service our system it looks at our time and attendance it looks at our certification requirements to make sure that the staff is done an appropriate number of these cases that our organization to confidently staff them out so the right people in the right case at the right time also makes the staff happier they get to do more advanced cases if they've had that training we also have to free up space within the hospital and I talked about the discharge lounge and these are individuals that are ready to go home but they're waiting for maybe medications for pharmacy the ride to pick them up or other Venition and Fusion this worked not only benefited those patients it's reduced our overall discharge time for from order to discharge across the organization by one hour so that's added to our capacity this is based on our preference our guidelines and you see here is the authoring tool that allows you to create that capacity so Sally will need a cardiac care unit the system goes and looks right now there's no room availability and it analyzes what patients might be ready this used to be multiple screens that you had to go through you had to process the different guidelines and protocols that's now all been ingested in the system it's able to read the notes and make the determination is this patient ready to move into the discharge lounge so volunteers allowed us to be impactful in multiple different parts of our organization to improve quality experience and safety you can't jump a 20-foot chasm of problems with two 10-foot leaps you really have to have a partner that helps build a bridge to the future and volunteers allowing us to do that like I said things like the discharge lounge length of stay improving our perioperative all together making sure that we're improving quality and safety but we also have to be appropriately reimbursed there are occasions where insurance companies will challenge that reimbursement and we have to go through utilization management process and that's using physicians that are reviewing and our average was 80 minutes now reduced down to seven that's not the only benefit from 50 to 70 pages of documents are now down to two that are optimized to the specific needs of that insurer improving their experience as well this capability to process huge amounts of information and look for like a diagnostic machine look for things that aren't readily available and visible on the surface like a chest x-ray we're also looking at errors across the system and so medical errors unfortunately do happen in 2016 Johns Hopkins published it's the number three cause of death in the United States we're doing everything we possibly can to make the safest health care was Palantir our partnership is going to allow us to achieve our goal of easy access to world-class health care thank you please welcome head of corporate development at Palantir Sasha Spivik another round of applause for our morning speakers when I joined Palantir 10 years ago it would have been very easy to perceive that the way we were internally bold, brazen, ambitious, a little annoying was different from how we were externally secretive shy no comment and if you squint a little bit you could tell that it was actually the same the differences that now you can see it's the same with eyes wide open we're unashamed we're unafraid we're deeply deeply proud of the work that we do we're deeply proud of our customers we stand by our customers and we're gonna stay the course so thank you for being here thank you for trusting us thank you for sharing your story and enjoy the rest of the day
