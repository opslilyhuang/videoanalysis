TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Well, it's great to be here. If you're tired of talking about software, we got some wonky congressional stuff to talk about. Spending bills, government shutdown. You just heard the introductions. Congressman Pat Ryan from New York, one of crazy election, bell weather, special election. It really was, I think, a preview of what was to come in the midterms. Would that be a fairly accurate Congressman? That sounds right. Well, West Point grad, and in fact, we have two Congressman who represent West Point in each of their districts, believe it or not. Congressman Vice Chairman of the House Armed Service Committee, Rob Whitman of Virginia. And anyway, this is just fantastic. That's great to see you. We start with the obvious, we can have a government shutdown. Listen, I, you know, obviously there's a lot of back and forth. There were some really good discussions yesterday in our conference. All that normally don't converse with each other. We're conversing with each other. So I think we get there like anything else. This is kind of getting on the bicycle, figuring out where the whole new set of members, where do we go, how do we get there? So I think we get there. You know, I won't say that it won't be a long arduous trip, but I do think that eventually we get there. One of the things that we have to do is we have to be able to pass a rule so we can start on defense approach. It's always astounding to me that, you know, we are where we are with that. Yesterday we had five folks that voted no on the rule. Two of them changed their mind today, but then we had another two that jumped in and said, no, they're not going to vote for the rule. So, you know, the very basic element of what we have to do to get Congress to function is you have to be able to get a rule to the floor. So I think that'll come up very soon again. Hopefully we'll be able to navigate that. And I think that's the segway into a CR. We'll be here over the weekend to work on that. That's going to be my next question. Yeah. You're going to be working with me. The WIPS office just put out that we have to be on standby for the weekends. Congressman Ryan, does that mean you're working this weekend or is that just... We're always working on the weekend. But I want to zoom out with respect to my colleague and say, you know, you're all sitting here whether you're working for the government, you're wanting to work with the government, you're already working with the government. It is pathetic. It's a shitshow. It's truly. I mean, my first year, I just hit my one year mark. This is not only embarrassing for us as a democracy, as Americans, but it costs us in our national security. You think about the signal this sends to adversaries and to industry who are wanting to work with us, already working with us. We, I know, agree and are working to incentivize more innovation, to draw good companies to work with us. And unfortunately, this does the opposite. So we have to... We need, I believe, people who approach us as patriots, not politicians, and I know that's easy to say, hard to do, but that's certainly what, you know, I think we're trying to... I'm trying to bring about. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I think it's incumbent on all of us to be able to get to yes. And sometimes that's difficult, but that's where we've got to be and listen. Pat and I agree, this is about the nation, it's about what's in the best interest of everybody, not certain ideas or ideologies. So both you, gentlemen, are on the House Armed Service Committee. We have the Vice Chairman of the House Armed Service Committee, we have the Vice-ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. What does AI mean to you both? What are you worried about and what are you excited about? Pat, go ahead. I'll... You've heard probably more of the technical side of it. I'm going to take a slightly different bend and talk about sort of the opportunity as a country, from my district's perspective. My district is about an hour and a half north of New York City. IBM, old IBM, mainframes were built there by my grandpa. Then they all left. And jobs left and hope left and opportunity left. And now actually the center of IBM's quantum research is in Pekipsi, New York in my district. President Biden came and committed to... Got them to commit to a $20 billion investment in our region in that work. A lot of you are also doing similar things across the country. So in addition to the technical and national security implications, I think competing in this area through things like Chips Act and other partnerships in a public-private way, I actually think it's like the last hope to bring the country together to rally in a constructive competition, vis-a-vis China, vis-a-vis other adversaries and sort of bring out the best. So I'll leave the technical piece to you all, the smarter brains in that area, but that's what's on us to bring us together. And in the committee, we really are doing that. And in the committee operates in a very bipartisan way, the Defense Armed Services Committee, to your credit and your leadership. Thank you. Thank you, Pat. Well, listen, I look at this in the same way in the broad perspective that Pat does. This is really one of those transcendent moments for our nation. This is that graduation to the next generation of technology. We saw it with the Industrial Revolution. We saw it with the age of the Internet. Now we're going to see it with the age of AI. And what I believe this does and what it gives us the opportunity to do is to understand the way we think about the systems that we used to defend this nation. This nation has always been about looking at hardware, hardware, hardware, hardware. And the secondary thought is software, software, software. Thank you, Palantir. You all have begun to turn the aircraft carrier around to think about it from a software standpoint. What this ought to be is an opportunity for us to say, you know what? Software should drive our thoughts on hardware. Software should drive how we develop systems. Software should drive how we develop solutions to the really difficult problems we'll face from our adversaries. This is that moment because we know data is going to drive everything in the future. We know machine learning is going to be that catapult to be able to do things. We know that artificial intelligence is the binding part that brings all that together. But the enabling part is how do we use that software element to bring all those things together. If you look at a generative AI, if you look at large language models, all those things are going to rely upon how we look at the enterprise. It has to start with software first. Great example, F-35. Incredible hardware platform. Another delay of almost a year in the TR3 software upgrade. That aircraft can do amazing things, but it can't do those amazing things without that software upgrade. Go ahead. The GAO just had a big report. It was $1.7 trillion when it was spending the next few decades. That sounds like real money to make 1.7 trillion, but I guess when you're 33 trillion in debt. Anyway, let's talk. That's all I have to conversation. This could get really wonky really quickly. I don't know how many DC types we have here, but it's what we talk about. That's what we geek out on. When it comes to national security, Pound to your CEO in an op-ed in the New York Times over the summer said, this is an arms race of a different kind. An arms race of a different kind has begun. He did not mention China, but clearly China was on the mind. Can you all talk to us about what you're most concerned about with the Chinese? Where's the US having an advantage? Where does China have an advantage? Thank you most. Yeah, I mean, I think the combined brain power in this room and your broader enterprises has always had us in the lead, kept us in the lead. And if we don't, as Dr. Cart very powerfully said in that op-ed, which my mother-in-law actually sent to me, which is kind of funny. Are you the right woman? Yeah. If we don't go all in and see this as a whole of nation, mobilize every component of academia, private sector, government in many ways, as I see it, we need to be able to get out of the way sometimes, and allow you all to iterate and move more quickly and with less sort of friction and bureaucracy. But if we don't see it in that way, and even in our political systems, as I was saying earlier, we will absolutely be bypassed. The civil military fusion approach that they've taken is top down. And so we have to lean into our competitive advantage, which is much more organic, iterative, bottom up. But I fear that the DOD systems and processes are top down and don't enable that kind of innovation. So one of my main reasons on this, I want to run for Congress, was to try to be a part of changing that, flipping that paradigm, and seeing what what pound seers done to do this. And other great people in the room shows that it actually is possible, but sometimes you have to fight through a lot of the friction. Yeah, I think what we have to do, too, is to look at the difference in our two systems. You look at China's very directive command and control. But when China starts down the road to say, let's develop something, what do they start with? At last year's Reagan National Defense Forum, I held up on 11 by 17 sheet of paper. That was blank. I said, this is what China starts with. Blank sheet of paper. They just start and they go. And if something works, it does. If not, they go in another direction. I held up the acquisition process, flow chart, for the Pentagon. You could not read the print on that 11 by 17 sheet of paper. So we have to make sure that we enable the creativity and innovation that we have in this nation, which is superior to China. Our system, I think, is the best ever put in place by mankind. Now it's imperfect, but you know what? It's an enabler. It's an enabler of talent. It's enabler of innovation. Let's operationalize that. Let's get it outside of the bureaucracy that right now sometimes is saying, if you don't have a requirement, sorry, it's a great idea, but we're not going to go down the road of acquisition. How do we take back those impediments? We have better talent than China. I would argue every single day, there's a reason why every day people want to come to the United States. How many people do you see knocking on the door or coming to China? Not too many. So let's enable what we have. I argue we have the intellectual talent. We have the mindset to do what we need to do. Sometimes you just need to get out of our own way. Just one additional thought that I am concerned about. We have to think about this in an alliance and partner framework too when you look around the world. And you know, we have a leadership role, obviously, which we need to embrace and lean into, but building systems frameworks, both at the technical and human and political layer that will allow us to plug in different allies in whatever theater when we're talking mostly into Pacific, but who knows. I think that's something we have not also done as well that should be easy and straightforward. So ask everybody, you're probably already doing this, but to think about that too as you're operating. So Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinsky arrived here to Washington. He was, this is the Capitol Hill. He's at the White House. He's at the Pentagon. Can you talk about how AI is helping on the battlefield and what areas do you see improvement needed? Sure. Well listen, one thing that I see is that the Ukrainians have been very adept at taking office shelf technology, putting it out there today, understanding what it does and what it doesn't do. And tomorrow, making changes to it in response to what they see from the Russians. They've been very adaptive on the battlefield. We need to learn from that because they don't have any impediments in their system. They don't have to go up the chain of command and go, hey, listen, I want to make a change to this. Can I make a change? And they go, well, yeah, but we have to send it up the chain. We have to get permission to do that. And then six months later, I mean, this change is happening on the battlefield on a daily basis. We have to be able to learn from that. Make no mistake. The Chinese are watching very closely too. So they are going to make the same changes that we do. I think there's a lot of opportunity there. They are using on-the-run software changes. Listen, we have that opportunity here. We have digital twin technology where we can take platforms, test it, gather the data today, put it into a learning model. Tomorrow, make changes. So they have to go through multiple machinations of development. We have the ability to do that. The key for us is that we have to restructure how the process of technological development takes place. And in order to appreciate all the advancements that Ukraine has been doing, we have to look at how we flatten the decision-making matrix here. I would argue that our warfighters know exactly what they need. If we listen to folks out there that are training every day, if you listen to that third class semen, that private first class, and they say, listen, if you do this, it'll be better. You need to listen to them. And listen, they're folks in the leadership of the Pentagon that said, let's streamline the process. We have to look at the bureaucratic middle in the Pentagon. There are some really good creators there and innovative thinkers, but there are also folks that are embedded in checking the box. We have to change the culture of the Pentagon to say it's about outcomes, not process. We have to change it from a process-focused organization. And again, that's a challenge. But we can do it. Is there anything more that Congress can do to help, whether it's with the commercial sector, whether it's making a difference in the battlefield in Ukraine or just in general? Well, I mean, one of the things that I think about this kind of builds on the previous question I agree with. I think there's almost every word you said. It's nice. It's refreshing. We should also be, so we need to be ruthlessly after action reviewing everything that we can gather and learn from what's happening in Ukraine, as you said. But one of the things I would like to see Congress do a whole lot more of, and the Pentagon and other national security institutions as well, is asking not just the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marine, and others on the ground, asking the technologists out there on the ground that are seeing the problems, experimenting in different ways. And hopefully this has improved since my time, but I'm going to guess it probably hasn't. How often are you all asked to come in? I know Palantir folks have been on the ground in Ukraine from essentially the beginning, right? So have you been invited in to share your, what are your takeaways, not just from a tech perspective, but really from, as you're saying, a cultural perspective. How do we replicate that true urgency of being in direct combat and try as best we can to replicate that here? What did the Ukrainians do? So that's something that I'm on the subcommittee on basically innovation cyber and tech that Congress and Mike Gallagher chairs. And almost every conversation we talk about this is this has to be a two-way street where the trust is really there. And we've all now worked together through two-plus decades of pretty intense stuff here. We have that trust where we know that technology partners and innovators often know more than we do. So that's something we're pushing for. I think that's a great point. What we have to do members of Congress, the military at every different level, everybody in the decision-making position, legislative executive branch has to ask everyone in this room as well as others, what's the possible? What can we do? What are the opportunities out there? It doesn't have to be dual use. It can be unique to the military. The only way we know what we can do is to ask those questions. We will never get the answers of those questions if we just ask each other. If Pat says, hey Rob, what do you think? I said, well maybe we could do this. I don't have the full scope of knowledge. Not if there's anybody in the Pentagon. So if we really want to operate at the speed of relevance that everybody has to be engaged in this. And Pat, you hit the nail on the head. This has to be an all-of-nation effort. This can't just be one sector saying, well we're going to work on this. The urgency of what we have to do for the very future of this nation, both strategically and economically, has to rely upon everybody saying, hey I got a good idea. And not being hesitant to stand up, there will be sometimes where we fail. We have to be unafraid of failure. We've gotten to where a culture is, we don't want to fail. And failing becomes something that becomes almost fatal to a career. It can't be like that. We have to say, let's try stuff. We're going to fail. One of the greatest successes in the history of humanity have been multiple failures. And then guess what? Boom, something breaks through. We're going to have breakthroughs. It'd be unafraid of failure. We have to listen to everybody. We have to lay everything on the table and say, let's make this happen. Just a question on the war in general. I was just curious when I was speaking. What are your constituents saying in the first district in Virginia, in Yorktown? Home of a famous battle, of course, it's made a battle in the revolution. And also in the Hudson Valley, what are your constituents saying about the war? About the support? How about the strategy? I find I know sometimes this fight right now in Congress seems to be support Ukraine or don't support Ukraine. And sometimes I'm curious, are we not talking enough about the strategy? You know, when most people look at the front lines, they see front lines that haven't really changed much in a year. Is those wars? I'm more and more concerned in my district, which is sort of a politically very purple district, asking those healthy skepticism shifting now to, you know, just straight up skepticism of why are we continuing to invest? I think that's a failure of leadership by all of us in the government at every level to make the case for, I think, freedom, frankly, which is probably the most agreed upon American value left in the country that this is really a fight about freedom and against autocracy and authoritarianism. But then to go a level deeper and link it to the everyday economic pressures that people in my district are feeling and explain what are the consequences if we don't lean in and invest here and what are the opportunities if we do. I think that's something I've actually thought about having a town hall just on the conflicts in Ukraine to give people the chance to air healthy, thoughtful, small, de-democratic concerns and then be able to really answer them. I don't think we've done enough of that. We just sort of took for granted everybody's support and didn't continue to earn it as elected officials. Has the president done enough to sell the case? We all have to do more, I think. I mean, I thought, I think he's been a clear voice on this from the beginning. His speech at the UN General Assembly was not, you know, pulling no punches about the stakes and the consequences and saying with President Zelensky, of course. But it's, work on on the ground, right? Like, I mean, I still have 800,000 people to make the case too, but we're certainly more on the ground and should be doing that too. And, Virginia? The same way, you know, we hear folks that question in the scale of what we're doing and devoting resources with all the needs here. How do they see the priorities funding for Ukraine, funding for issues here at home? We have to be able to talk specifically about what this is really boiling down to. It's about another nation in an unprovoked way attacking another sovereign nation. We have to understand, too, that if this graduates outside of Ukraine, which it can, if there's no resistance there, then it becomes a NATO enterprise. An article five is invoked and guessed what, whether we want to or not, we are going to be there. So I think sometimes people don't understand that. I think also, too, there's been some things as, you know, some money that's been unaccounted for. And, you know, we're going to be able to do more to tell folks we're doing everything we can in the realm of having a special IG that looks at everything, Manitarian Aid, Aid directly to the country where munitions are going. People here, too, that our munitions stores are starting to go down. They're worried about our security. And then that also intersects into the issue with Taiwan and what happens there. So all these issues are interrelated. It's a complex foreign relations effort to try to communicate to folks. But we have to do that. We have to say, hey, here's where we are. I mean, I get a lot of people that said, no more funding for Ukraine. I said, well, okay, but let's talk about what that means. Let's talk about what that is. And what we've done, listen, I agree, no blank check. And I agree, there needs to be a strategy. What's happening? Where are we now? What's the outcome going to be? Those are things that people expect us to give them answers to. And we can at least say, hey, here's the strategy. Here's where we play a role. Another very valid question is, wait a minute. You know, the United States is sending checks over there. What are European countries doing? What's everybody else doing as far as this? They've made commitments. How much of the commitments have they met? You know, those are all very good questions, as Pat said. Questions that we need to answer. If we are going to go to the American people and said, by the way, we need more resources. They're going to say, well, wait a minute. Answer those questions first. That's what we have to do. Before I turn over to Q&A, just a quick follow up. David Ignatius, writing the Washington Post. Almost a year ago, he went to Ukraine with Palantir. And reading his column, you know, almost a year later, struck me that, you know, if you read it, you'd think Ukraine was about to win. You'd think, wow, man, a machine working great. Wow, all these great Palantir gizmos, apart in the lack of technical speak. This is great. Russians are struggling. And yet here we are a year later, almost. These front lines have barely changed. Do you think this war is at a stalemate? What needs to be done to break the stalemate? Sorry. I'm passionate. The former army intelligence officer. Jump in, yeah. Here we go. It's messy and hard, right? And this is where we have to be honest and straightforward. This is war like most people alive on Earth today haven't actually experienced, right? And so we have to be clear that you can't, and this is where I get very pissed off to be blunt. You're in the heat of battle and you're starting a question. You're allies in a way that there's a productive healthy way to do that, with a friend and a partner, like my wife and I do, behind closed doors. And then there's a way that's really actually undercuts your unity right when we know Putin is looking to drive these wedges. So we have to be just more clear and direct and strong. They absolutely can win. I think they're going to win, but it actually comes down to the political will of the United States and our European partners. And that's shapeable if we lead on it. And we don't try to do that thing. So that's what we're pushing for. I got to say, I'm discouraged, and this may seem partisan, but it's just objective. I think probably more than half of the Republican party right now probably isn't wouldn't vote to send more funding. I'm not trying to put you on the spot individually, but that's a real problem. That's a huge change from a year ago. And in my view, we have to do the work to get that number back up. Yeah, listen, I think it's about having that discussion about where we are. And again, people want to know where we're going. And some of that's undetermined. I mean, you can't predict what's going to happen on the battlefield there, but I think you can say these are the things that we would want to accomplish with additional devotion of resources, because they're looking at as a competition here in the United States for resources, which they should. So I think we have to be able to answer those questions. And I like Pat. I don't want to discount any of those questions and say, oh, that's unrealistic. Or you just don't understand the broader perspective. People are pretty intuitive about this. So we have to engage and say, hear the things that we have to look at as a nation. Here's another big issue that, as way, I see it, is you can have a discussion in the short term, but we also need to really lay out the long term. In the long term, I think, too, sometimes what people don't look at. Because of what they deal with on a daily basis, I mean, most families look at it and go, hey, what am I dealing with today? What's the price of gas? What's the price of grocery, those things? They put it in context of what they read in the headlines and they go, wait a minute. All this money, do you crane? And wait a minute, we're struggling here. Why? So what we have to say is, well, let's look at where we are as a nation a year, 5, 10 years down the road with Russia either being weakened or Russia being emboldened by what does or does not happen in Ukraine. All right. We've got about five minutes remaining. Let's turn it over to questions. Maybe just to show a hand. Right there. Hi. Georgina Dinardo, inside defense. Thank you very much for your time. So I didn't know the press was here. I was doing up here. I always think I was doing up here. Potted plant. So a lot of people, government officials have recently cited. Ukraine, kind of as teaching a lot of lessons and shaping a lot of plans like the recent cybersystem strategy. I was wondering how you, too, maybe see Ukraine shaping our future involvement with the possibility of Taiwan. Good question. Was now, I'll say it pretty simply. It teaches us a lesson in speed and capability. It shows us you've got to be able to do things quickly. You have to have capability that you feel quickly. From my standpoint, that means we have to change the mindset of the Pentagon. I actually have some language in this year's NDA that says, the Pentagon needs to look at acquisition now in different lanes. Everything has always been a squizzid systems. Let's build a great destroyer. Let's build a great aircraft. Let's build a great M1 Abrams tank. Well, we got to think about today to close the gap is speed. Speed means let's do expendable platforms. Let's do a trittable platforms. Let's put guard rails on there. Let's say within this price range, let's develop these things. Because if not, what will happen is the process gets long. We want to put a lot of capability on something where we may not need that much capability. And then it adds time and cost, neither of which we have the luxury of. So let's do things in those lanes, put guard rails there. And I think we can do some really good stuff in a really short period of time. And the bottom line for us with Taiwan and China, is we have to make sure every morning, Xi Jinping wakes up and goes, no, not today. Just to fall up on that, how likely is China, you think, and then invade Taiwan in the next five, 10 years? I'm not going to weigh in on that one. I mean, excuse me. The way I think about it is for follow. The way is what is within our power to change that and deter. And this is where, to me, one of the biggest takeaways was you look at the post-crimian 2014 decision for us to send folks in and start working with the Ukrainians early. And huge returns on that investment when it got obviously much more serious and heavy. I know, depending on, certainly taking that lesson already. And we've been hearing about that in some of the various briefings. And then, to me, the question I was asked is will an American political will and Taiwan political will? Those are going to be the centers of gravity, obviously. And that's what ultimately will deter Xi or not. And so there's all the other pieces of this hardware, software, it all working together with conops and everything else. But that's where we need to make that case as well. And I was very honored to lead a congressional delegation to meet with President Xi there in Taiwan. I've been very impressed in what they're doing. Military service now goes to mandatory four months to 12 months. The resources are dedicating there. What we're doing in country to help them, doing the training. All those things leading in the right direction, partners in the region we met with the officials there and Prime Minister Koshita's cabinet. Think about it. Japan's doubling their defense budget. They'll be the third largest military in the world now. We also went to the Philippines. President Marcos, Jr. there, much different than President Duterte, what they're doing to help us at Clark and Subik. All the different pieces of this are coming together. The interesting thing there is that they understand the relevance and magnitude of the threat. And I've seen the sea change in what they are doing and it is pad pointed out. This is about partnership. We cannot do this by ourselves. We are also in Australia for the American Australia legislative dialogue with Prime Minister Albanisi members of parliament there. They are all in as well as Prime Minister Rudd, now US ambassador. We had a great conversation with him today with the China Select Committee. I think all the things are aligning. I asked Prime Minister Rudd today, the ambassador, former Prime Minister Rudd, I said, is Xi Jinping deterrible? And we think that he is. I don't know any leader out there that says, hey, listen, I don't have a long term perspective on my either term in office or how they exist. So I think we can. But in the words of the Immortal Jerry Reed, we have a long ways to go in a short time to get there. Right there. Thank you. You're good. I get you. So, hold on. You were talking about polling in terms of? Yep. Andrew Lockwood, volunteer. So you were talking about polling in terms of the average American and how that shifted regarding support for Ukraine. I think you could struggle to find very few Americans who could understand why Taiwan is in our national interest. So if we're saying that there's lessons learned here in terms of Ukraine right now, that is a political function to educate the American public. How are you all thinking about that? When does that start? I, again, your great question, very, great question, hits around the head. It has to start immediately. I think that I tried to get on the Select Committee, but no freshmen allowed. But I think the Select China Committee is a really important initiative to that effect. To just start the dialogue and do it in a kind of interesting way that keeps people engaged and brings people in. I think it has to come through the economic competitiveness lens that I sort of alluded to before. Why does it matter that both a democratic partner in Taiwan, but also a critical economic partner when you think about our entire global technology ecosystem maintains their position as it is and is bolstered? And so tying that to individual opportunities in each of our districts around the country, and this is why I keep going back. I think we'll look at the CHIPS Act as one of the most pivotal and we have more to do, but most pivotal and packed full pieces of legislation. I hope of the next few decades. I agree. And you have to be able to boil down what is normally a macro argument about the impact of Taiwan on the world economy and boil it down and say, hey, listen, here's the bottom line. Look at the amount of semiconductors that come out of Taiwan. If that's under Chinese control, what you use every day, your cell phone, your microwave, your automobile, all of a sudden, it's going to be very different with the Taiwan that's under Chinese control versus where they are today. So I think you can make that argument. And you can make that argument in less than 30 seconds. And if you can do that, you can convince the American people of the importance of Taiwan. Listen, it's a little more extensive argument about Ukraine, although it's still about what Russia will do if unrestrained in Ukraine. So we have to be willing to make those arguments. And I think we can make them pretty clearly, pretty simply and succinctly. I'm afraid that's all we have for now is a great panel. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Thanks, Luke. We're coming here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
