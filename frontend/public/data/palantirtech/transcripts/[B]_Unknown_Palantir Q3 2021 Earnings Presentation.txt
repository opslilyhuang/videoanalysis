Good morning. Welcome to Palantir's third quarter, 2021 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our investor relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-gap financial measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or an isolation from GAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAP to comparable GAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings, are available on our investor relations website at investors.poundtier.com. Joining me on today's call are Shom Sankar, Chief Operating Officer, Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. I'll turn the call over to Shom to get us started. Thank you, Rodney. It was a fantastic quarter across the board. In Q3, total revenue grew 36%. Commercial revenue growth has accelerated in every quarter over the last year, from 4% in Q4 2020 to 19% in Q1 to 28% in Q2, now 37% in Q3. At this scale, acceleration like this, it's gravity-defying. US commercial revenue growth accelerated once again to 103% year-over-year. We added 34 net new customers in Q3. To put this in perspective, our commercial customer count grew by 46% sequentially. We have more than doubled our commercial customer counts as the beginning of the year. We closed 54 deals of a million dollars or more. 33 of which were 5 million or more, and 18 of which were 10 million or more. Adjusted free cash flow was 119 million, a margin of 30%. Total deal value grew 50% to 3.6 billion. Commercial deal value more than doubled to 2.2 billion. Remaining performance obligations increased by 172%. In year-to-date, we have grown revenue 44% to over 1.1 billion. We have generated an adjusted free cash flow margin of 29% and 32% adjusted operating margin. There are so many wins this quarter. Instead of going through them, customer by customer as I usually do, I wanted to highlight three themes. One, we are seeing more traction selling into the defense industrial base as a customer. Foundry has shown that it can help in the production of the A320 of ram pickup trucks, auto parts, PPE, and tractors. It can do it better, faster, and cheaper. And the defense industrial base is seeing that it can have the same impact on the production of fighter jets, naval ships, and land vehicles. We are excited to do more here with L3 Harris, hunting ingles, and other large primes. Secondly, our work and automotive and more generally mobility is growing. We are adding more customers across the mobility value chain from OEMs and their suppliers all the way to EV charging companies and insurers. And lastly, our work in healthcare is exploding. The NHS, MD Anderson, 70 academic medical centers through the NIHS N3C, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and even more regional US providers means that foundry is helping to manage over 300 million patient lives and growing. We have a very unique opportunity and a diverse footprint that we believe continues to uniquely position us to deliver on the necessary transformation in healthcare delivery, from operational excellence to complex clinical care. Cutting edge product and continued innovation and distribution drove these exceptional results in Q3. And you can really see that in the consistently accelerating commercial business. We are seeing a profound pull on foundry in the market. As organizations digest and synthesize lessons from the shocks of COVID and subsequent events, there is a canonical spot for foundry in the enterprise architecture that the market has synthesized. Foundry is the nervous system and the cardiovascular system of the enterprise. It is the connective tissue that connects your analytics to your operational systems. Such an architecture marries a digital twin of the enterprise with action APIs that allow you to first model and simulate and second orchestrate and execute complex cross-functional transactions. As the COVID-19 crisis pulled the tide out, that's exactly what was revealed as missing. Companies needed to move beyond visibility, beyond analytical insights, to having the technical infrastructure to translate that into coordinated orchestrated actions in the operations of their business. And one of the coolest places to see this working is with our day zero companies. These companies have enormous ambition and deeply value the step change in speed and the reduction of expenses foundry delivers when consumed as infrastructure as a service. Wejo is able to develop market ready applications and is little as six weeks on foundry. Sarko is integrating half a trillion data points per month to accelerate design, maintenance and commercialization of their Ironman suits. Lilium is flying through ground and flight testing, wielding the vast data generated by every sensor streaming from the aircraft. I'd like to introduce some of our day zero founders to unpack this a little bit more. These companies have a strong engineering culture and they've been able to very quickly take on the platform and make it a core part of their tech infrastructure. My third generation manufacturer grew up in Detroit from my earliest days was inspired by the importance of manufacturing as an industry. At Festradius we believe the impact of cloud manufacturing will be as profound on the physical world as cloud computing has been in the digital world. Wejo is igniting and leading the mobility revolution. We're unlocking a value of connected vehicle data and autonomous vehicle data. How and say foundry supercharges our distribution to thousands and thousands of new suppliers and new solutions in industry. Foundry unlocks the business potential of our youth. We found ourselves constantly trying to twist our business to fit inside someone else's perspective of how businesses work and that didn't work. They've been using foundry as their data operating system so end to end from cloud hosting to data kind of integration from different data sources through using a lot of the out-of-the-box connectors that we have in the platform from their harmonizing the data using open source languages like Python, SQL, using Spark as their distributed can compute engine. We're collecting data on every part that we make today. They about the design, they about how that part is made in our factories, data about how when that part is moved ultimately to our customers. Speed is our superpower. Speed to me means real-time processing of every 17 billion data points a day. In fact, we've processed in real-time over 12 trillion data points. Our business is premised upon high quality data and the understanding of that data on the part of people. Once they have this data asset, we've been just building a number of operational applications both for their internal kind of operations to help like supercharges that but also for even kind of external third-party users as part of their kind of tech offering. Foundry enables us to build solutions fast and unlock unique intelligence for industry. For we Joe, a partnership with Palancy was the obvious choice. If you're not using foundry, you better think about what your position in the company is because everybody will be using foundry. A big thanks to our builders who shared more about their ambition and the transformative impact of foundry on their operations. We started this program to supercharge earlier-stage companies, enabling them to create a central operating system for their data and to scale rapidly from day zero. These companies, they're not just managing their data and their operations, they are wielding them to blitz scale and win. We announced our second cohort of builders in October. There are seven companies from a diverse set of industries and we continue to partner with innovative companies across industries such as automotive, biotech, healthcare, media, and more. Turning more broadly to the commercial business, the scope of our impact is expanding. Foundry's infrastructure is a big theme we are excited about. Customers are building their software on top of our platform and now we have yet another way to power that with a major product innovation that extends the openness and flexibility of our infrastructure for developers that we're calling operational APIs or OPIs for short. This liberates the ontology to serve as the nervous system, the cardiovascular system of the enterprise, as a unified action and orchestration layer. This API toolset allows for third parties and customer developers to programmatically interact with foundry's ontology. In this headless mode, Ideacon leverages the power of the ontology in all of their enterprise applications via this open architecture. What's uniquely powerful about the ontology, it's not the nouns, it's not the things in the business, it's the representation of the verbs, the actions that can be taken to those things in the business. The fact that inventory can be allocated, production can be scheduled, orders can be fulfilled. To accomplish these deceptively simple actions requires you to read and write to potentially tens of source systems transactionally. Foundry lets you orchestrate complex, cross-system decisions to win and turn market disruption into your competitive glory. For example, a large industry partner is unlocking value by integrating Microsoft Power Apps with the foundry ontology. Power Apps through our OPIs can affect business decisions, powering workflows and writing data back to external operational and transactional systems like ERP, MES, warehouse management systems, and more. This is the modern operating system in action. We launched Apollo this past week as a commercial offering, enabling any software company to leverage our deployment infrastructure to take their SaaS where no SaaS has gone before, on-prem, classified clouds, air gap networks, and to the edge. Here to tell us more is Greg D. Armin, the mad scientist behind the conception and launch of Apollo. Apollo is an orchestration engine for the enterprise, enabling continuous deployment, configuration management, and central software operations across these many cloud and on-prem environments. Apollo employs a number of different concurrent processes including version management, advanced role strategies, and release promotion to ensure platform state up-to-date operational 24-7. With Apollo, you can release new capabilities, deploy the mid-scale, compose them into novel platforms, de-risk releases, and rapidly resolve problems as they arise. Having deployment health and continuity on a single-panic glass gives engineers a common interface to handle risk management concerns unique to each environment. Different environments have different risk tolerances when it comes to software updates. For instance, you'll want to throw out new features to canary environments first before moving those same updates to classified networks or to critical edge hardware that are harder to operate with them. Apollo facilitates software stability across these different environments by using a concept called release channels. Environments can subscribe to a release channel and accordance with their individual risk tolerance and appetite for new features. Once pushed via release channel, Apollo enables the evaluation and roll outs through a powerful suite of tools to help operators understand the risks associated with each pipeline, surface problems, and ship code better. Apollo makes it possible to take the same approach to continuous delivery across different security or classification boundaries by enabling you to deploy an Apollo hub within each network boundary. Each network hub is responsible for managing the environments on that network. This compliance-aware change management enables Apollo to centrally manage services in environments across different compliance regimes, empowering seamless operations across highly regulated business environments. Apollo effectively removes the deployment environment as it can strain, enabling engineers to focus on velocity and application code. They write code once that works for all customer environments. And we continue to push the envelope of Apollo capability by enabling streaming processing at the edge. Once again, we are building five years ahead of the market. Software shamans building technology that will meet its moment. With our latest investments, you will be able to develop streaming pipelines in Foundry that you then package up version and continuously deploy to edge compute infrastructure, be it a Humvee, a satellite, a 5G base station to enable real-time processing of large amounts of data in a decentralized efficient manner. These pipelines, they'll be versioned, upgrade, manage, and orchestrated by Apollo. Imagine you'll be able to blue-green upgrade your streaming pipelines across submarines, factory floors, five and six G networks. This is a revolutionary capability that will give our customers the edge against their competition. There are two modular offerings that we've taken to market that we were really quite excited about. Carbon and emissions management and AML for crypto and fintechs. Starting with carbon emissions there is a huge need to not simply account for carbon and more broadly emissions. But what are you going to do about it? Day to day, month to month, how do you manage trade-offs between production on time and full? Revenue, margin, and emissions targets? How do you understand the levers you have to pull in the implications of each lever? Do you have the ability to understand the consequences of changing a supplier or setting a different delivery routing or changing a production location on your emissions? Can you put that information into a single pane of glass? The same pain that your company uses to manage production or revenue or margin? Because until you do, emissions management will only be a source of beta for you, something that you do so that you're not left behind. But once you do, you'll be able to use it to beat your competition and win in the market. These workflows are tailor-made for Foundry and leverage our digital twin and supply chain capabilities to present a single pane of glass to view revenue, margin, production, and all emissions. To not just see, but to manage the outcome. This is an area that we are seeing growing momentum in no small part because of the obvious charisma of alpha of developing a competitive edge. Customers across disparate industries are building carbon-focused common operating pictures to track live emissions, to simulate emissions impacts of the changes to, for example, suppliers, to technologies and regulations and to make real-time changes to their business. The other offering we are really excited about is Foundry for Crypto. We have found a unique fit with fast-growing crypto companies that need industrialized compliance solutions. We are leveraging our deep, anti-money laundering and know-your-customer expertise developed over years helping governments find compliance issues with the world's largest banks and helping those banks respond and harden their compliance programs. I mentioned last quarter how one of Europe's largest retail banks has deployed our AML solution in two days. Two days, the cost, speed, and performance is unmatchable. These crypto exchanges and fintechter disruptors are actually technical and can easily discern what legacy banks struggle to that legacy compliance solutions are often two or more decades behind. We believe there are no alternatives that can compete on cost, speed, and performance, and we're really excited to put more weight behind this in the market. Turning to government, we continue to advance our mission of becoming the U.S. government's central operating system as we extend our footprint across defense, healthcare, and civilian agencies. In the third quarter, we sign new deals with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Air Force, the NIH, and more. I'm proud to say that the Metaconstellation, which we featured in last quarter's earnings call, met its moment when called upon by UKMOD to enable non-combatant evacuation operations in Afghanistan. As a reminder, the Metaconstellation is radically changing how satellites are tasked, the latency of collection, and it's creating a fundamental link in the AI-enabled kill chain. We are orchestrating a Metaconstellation of more than 300 satellites by working with an array of commercial space companies. These companies have been deploying constellations of hyperspectral, radar, and elint sensors into orbit, and we are putting all that power directly into the hands of the front lines, empowering the edge. N-to-N, Gotham and Foundry infrastructure, including Metaconstellation provided unparalleled capability and was stood up in less than a day for UKMOD operations. In addition, Metaconstellation was also used to great effect that last month's Scarlett Dragon U.S. military exercises, where it provided timely and effective targeting information. This is all made possible because of a Apollo for the J.I. We were recently down-selected by the U.S. Army to be the sole provider of the Army's Intelligence Data Fabric and Analytics Foundation for the Capability Drop 2 program. The Army will deploy Gotham to support intelligence workflows worldwide, with a globally federated Intelligence Data Fabric and Analytics platform spending multiple security classifications. Our work on CD2 is just one of many initiatives of which we are engaging with the Army, including CD1 and Titan that will accelerate the decision chain and provide decisive advantage for our armed forces in the near-peer fight. We have a motivating set of customers and growing pipeline for big pursuits in 22 and beyond. And it is growing every quarter. We're not just competing for programs, our unique capabilities are creating their own opportunities. Our work in healthcare continues to expand, and we recently signed a four-year 87 million dollar contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs. This department serves nine million veterans and their family members, and spends nearly a quarter trillion dollars per year. After supporting them in the Exigency during COVID-19 response, we want an unrestricted competition to help power their data transformation efforts. Our software is going to enable the VA to integrate data across its large IT landscape and ultimately to deliver better care and services for our veterans. It is a privilege to serve our veterans and warfighters, both on the battlefield and in their period after service. Our collaboration with the NIH continues in the fight against COVID-19. As N3C deepens its partnership with Palantir, leveraging Foundry as their research backbone, this two-year award carries a total potential value of $60 million, and the N3C data enclave represents one of the largest collections of COVID-19 health records in the world. Additionally, our work with NCATS expanded with an increase in total potential value of $24 million. Zooming out a bit from mud to space, big picture in the government segment, we are seeing an emerging opportunity to help define the next wave of disruption. One thing, perhaps the one thing we have demonstrated to the market is that it is possible to sell software at scale to the government for programs of record where the government might have historically otherwise bought labor and services. And of course, in doing so, we have radically transformed the margin profile of these big government contracts. There is an immense opportunity in this sector to partner with existing government contractors to productize their solutions that they are delivering as services today and in doing so to transform the EBITDA, they generate against their existing revenue with our platforms. We have proven we can do this with our business and we are exploring opportunities to partner with firms that have a disruptive vision and realize that they can stand on our shoulders. The 15 years and nearly $3 billion of R&D that we have done to productize and scale their own offerings. Before turning it over today, I wanted to give a quick shout out to every Hobbit and just reflect on our journey as much over the last two decades as over the last year. A year ago, we gave our first results as a public company. We should be proud of those five quarters of results, but even prouder of the collective effort and passion that begot those results. We pivoted the whole company to respond to the exigent events of COVID for governments and commercial entities around the world. But of course, that happened before we went public. And we all had that question, will we preserve the cultural essence of Pounder after the listing? Will we have the radical ability to organize and reorganize around the problem at hand while capturing the integral of our innovation? While in Q3, we could answer that question definitively. Yes, when the bat signal was put up in the night sky, the Motley crew of Hobbits answered the call for America and her allies. Five quarters down at least 500 more to go. Over to you, Dave. Thanks, Sean. All review our third quarter performance followed by our outlook. We had a record breaking Q3 as continued product innovation and our ongoing investments in distribution led to accelerating customer account growth and strong free cash flow. We generated revenue growth of 36% in the quarter, bringing Q3 revenue to 392 million and year-to-date revenue to more than 1.1 billion, up 44% versus the first nine months of last year. Our business continues to demonstrate very strong cash generation. Third quarter cash from operations was 101 million and improvement of 153 million versus the prior year period. We delivered 119 million in a just free cash flow in the third quarter, representing a margin of 30%. The strength of our third quarter performance brings year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to 320 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 29% and a $605 million improvement from the prior year period. Third quarter adjusted operating income increased to 116 million, representing a margin of 30%, or fourth consecutive quarter with adjusted operating margin of 30% or greater. We added 34 net new customers in the third quarter and our total customer account grew 20% quarter over quarter. Our commercial customer account increased 46% quarter over quarter and it is more than doubled since the end of 2020. Our new customers are scaling faster and more efficiently than ever before. Your-to-date revenue from new customers acquired in year is up 66% to 38 million and these customers are already generating contribution margin of 36%. This compares with just 23 million in revenue and a negative 26% contribution margin for new customers over the comparable period in 2020. Drilling down into our third quarter revenue, total revenue grew 36% year-over-year ahead of our prior guidance of 33%. Our US business continues to demonstrate strong growth with revenue increasing 45% year-over-year in Q3. Looking at our Q3 revenue year-over-year by segment, we continue to see broad-based momentum in our commercial business. Total commercial revenue was 174 million, up 37% and representing our third-street quarter of accelerating commercial revenue growth. Our investments in product and distribution continue to drive growth, particularly in the US where commercial revenue increased 103% in Q3. And our international business continues to gain momentum as well, with international commercial revenue growth accelerating for the third-street quarter as economies continue to reopen and recover. Government revenue increased 34% as we signed new deals with the Air Force, HHS and NIH, and we were recently down-selected by the US Army to provide its intelligence, data, fabric, and analytic solution under CD2. In the third quarter, we closed 54 deals of a million or more in total contract value, including 33 deals of 5 million or more and 18 deals of 10 million or more. Third quarter buildings increased 56% year-over-year and remaining performance obligation increased 172 year-over-year as we continue to improve contracting, push out or remove termination for convenience causes, and move to shorter duration billing cycles. Total remaining deal value increased 50% year-over-year to 3.6 billion, with commercial remaining deal value increasing 101%. Third quarter trailing 12-month revenue per customer was 7 million, down sequentially and reflecting continued acceleration in customer acquisition as we added 34 net new customers in the quarter. We continue to expect rapid expansion in our customer-based moving forward as we invest in our sales teams and channel partners and we would expect average revenue per customer to continue to taper as a result of our growing customer count. When excluding new customers added in the quarter, average revenue per customer was 8.8 million, up 26% year-over-year, and we continue to generate strong growth with our largest customers. Trailing 12-month revenue per top 20 customers was 41.3 million, up 35% year-over-year. Next, I'll discuss our third quarter margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin was 82% up from 81% in the year-ego period. Contribution margin was 57% up from 56% in the year-ego period. Third quarter income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was 116 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 30%, or fourth consecutive quarter with adjusted operating margin at or above 30%. Third quarter adjusted expenses were 276 million, up 2% year-over-year, and 28% when adjusting for one time direct listing expenses incurred in Q3 2020. The bulk of expense growth is driven by continued investments in product development and sales to support durable long-term growth. Marketing expenses were up 144% quarter-over-quarter as we continued a fuel-demand generation. In the third quarter, we generated 119 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 30%. Through the first nine months of 2021, adjusted free cash flow was 320 million, representing an improvement of 605 million versus a prior year period. We ended the third quarter with over 2.3 billion in cash and no debt. Turning to our outlook, for our Q4 revenue guidance, we expect revenue of 418 million, and we expect adjusted operating margin of 22%. Our Q4 revenue guidance implies full-year 2021 revenue of 1.527 billion, which represents another year revenue growth of 40% or higher. Additionally, for the full-year 2021, we are raising our annual adjusted free cash flow guidance to an excess of 400 million, an increase of 100 million from our prior guidance. Continuing to execute the guidance strategy, set forth by our CEO Alex Carp in our year-end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide guidance of 30% or greater revenue growth for this year and the next four years at each earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roddy to open up Q&A.
