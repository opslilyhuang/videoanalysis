TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Let's get down to Florida this morning where our Sarah Eisen is sitting down exclusively with Palantir's Alex Carp. Morning, sir. Good morning, Carl. Yes, I am here at the Comcast Business Technology event, which is on the sidelines of the players' championship in Florida. And joining me is Alex Carp. He is the CEO of Palantir. It is great to speak with you. Very nice to be here. Happy to be among the players. Yeah, same here. So, that I want to talk about the stock for a moment. It has boomed and you have seen a lot of growth recently driven by commercial accounts, corporate customers. What's driving that? Well, I mean America. You know, America is the most meritocratic competitive market in the world. And so that's obviously a huge advantage for us because our basic claim to fame is the software. Historically, over 20 years, the stuff you're installing isn't going to work. What we're doing will work. It's not we do it. We built the software in a way maybe you wouldn't think it should be built, but that is the way it should be built. Whether that's been on the battlefield, fighting terrorism, our AI product, and we go across the country. And we say, you've installed a lot of things. You obviously see the power of AI. There's a question of what AI is for some people. It's machine learning, for some people's algorithms, it's something. Some people, it's how do you actually extract value of a large language mouse. We will show you our product working in hours. And then you can actually compare it to what you would like to do. And in every other culture in the world, there's still very much driven by ideology of what should work. We have deep experience managing algorithms. And now, by extension, large language mouse because of the work that our product has been used to power in the classified space. Companies are eating it up. And companies like it, they like the approach. I think one of the most important things that happened in software was large language models convinced people that you could get value out of AI. That's obvious. But they also somehow convinced people software is not a luxury product. It has to work. It's got to move from something that you just paid for to something that improves your margins, improves your ability to organize your business, makes your business more robust. Also, last not least, one of the great dangers of this kind of the world is safe. Everything's going to work out. We're all going to get rich, year and half year, and like each other, more farce, was that the assumptions that your products could be not robust, barely work thin, add no value. But that was a playbook from Silicon Valley onto the commercial space. That playbook is just completely failed. And our view of how you build this is you build something that is more valuable for the partner where there's a classified space or a company employing hundreds of thousands of people that will help them. But companies have a lot of choices now, increasingly more choices. There's the Googles and the Microsofts. What is it that you are providing that is different? And who do you compete with? Well, I mean, you should ask the clients who are buying it what we're providing. But like what we're really doing is saying, okay, everybody claims, everyone's making the same claim. The claim is you can get a large language model to increase your output at a lower cost. So you get more sales, more revenue, higher margin. Yeah. Okay, but we're making the same claim. The only thing is we're not making a claim. We're saying, we will show you while they tell you. And those, like all these people making all these claims are the only marketing we really have. Because the most important thing is now we've set a standard. The standard is we are going to make the enterprise more efficient. We're going to make the enterprise stronger. We're going to have innovation work in a way that it's differential. Meaning innovation means nothing if five companies have the same exact margins have the same exact ability to transform our equally robust. We're saying, pick a part of your business. For some people by the way, it's not margins. It's not even, it's like, okay, they're worried that their supply chain may break tomorrow. Because they're dependent on a part that comes from a country that's about to be disrupted. They're worried that they have to figure out what's likely to break in their product. They don't have enough engineers. People have very disparate use cases, but the basic use cases. My business has to be healthier, stronger than it is now. And healthy and stronger than the people I compete against. Yeah, I mean, what are some good if you could specific use cases? Because you've called out companies and earnings publicly. Airbus, for instance, we talked to you when the CEO of Hurts, a heart rental company. Where's it working best? I mean, it's working very well on all these companies. I mean, one use case I'm very, very excited about is our work that's now public panasonic battery. So this is super interesting. Most batteries that have to be built for EVs are built were built for me in Japan. How do you bring a company that produces things in a exceedingly Japanese robots, Japanese workers, people who've been working in that environment for 30 years. People who know their machine that builds the battery so well that they can literally walk by it and in two or two or a long. How do you bring that to Nevada? And then have people who are high school college trained, who are not engineers, who have never worked at a battery company that are from a completely different culture. And then ours or theirs and ramp it up so that they can go to the machine and figure out where's the machine broken? How do I replace parts before they're broken? How do I actually understand which part is the problem, which part is not the problem? Every single part has a 10,000 page manual on how you fix it. So you basically, and what if the what if the what if the engineer in Japan is not available? So these are use cases you can actually do with large language models and our product. What you can do is you can produce a manufacturing environment just like you can in Taiwan and Japan in this country. So these these environments are built specifically for Japanese and Taiwanese and other cultures. And in the past you just couldn't build an American now you can't. And then there's a myriad of other ones like how do you task a satellite? You're a large agricultural company. You have to decide which satellite you deploy over which satellite you don't. And then for more technical people who gets to decide where your production goes? Who can shut it down? Who can ramp it up? Who can think these things? You just can't walk into an enterprise with a large language model outsource your knowledge of your enterprise and task the large language model. You'd be essentially outsourcing. You could have hallucinate your business out of business. So when I when I said I was you were coming on I talked to some of the analyst and they all want to talk about these boot camps that you do because apparently this is just like super fast right training on AI and on your platforms. And they want to know how quickly you are transforming corporate companies into accounts off of these boot camps. I think you done more than 800. Yeah. So but the relevant just so just you know. A couple years ago we were doing like 70 80 90 pilots a year. And now in the next year we're going to do you know 20 times that boot camps and what's what the strategic advantage of them? Well everyone's claiming to do things and we're showing them being done. So it's like you know like look we could we could hire marketing. We've never been good at marketing. We could run around say there are 50 things we do better. There are certain also technical things that we've built that people don't understand their value yet. So it's better just to show the value of an understanding. So let's say you know the technology show the value of a robust enterprise offering show the value of your ability to do handoffs inside your enterprise dis disambiguate right from read functions in the context of using that you can have long conversations or you can show it. So that's the central advantage. And by the way the other advantages. So we've done across US government we want to set a standard and then everyone can be measured by that standard. Great. It's meritocracy out there. You X Y Z company AI dot com. Great. Well why are you doing boot camps? You know it's like we have like decades of a product experience in our products that are valuable for this use case. And then on the conversion thing. Look you know I it's like what we are seeing people adopt recalibrate their standard and quite frankly. As you saw if you've seen this morning people are recommending our product one to another one of the other things that's very special about the US opposed to like American CIO CEOs and others. They call their buddies. They're like hey you're driving. I'm driving. I'm driving. I'm driving. Maybe you ought to get on the pallet your train. So you know that it's like we're it's like it's kind of an obvious thing if you there's no point as saying our product is the best when we can show it to be the best. You're also I mean use cases on the battlefield as well. Obviously the government is a huge customer. You recently secured the Titan contract which was a big deal because it was for building a vehicle right using the software to build a vehicle. What what what is it allowing you to do. I was a changing modern warfare. The most important thing our country can do is in the in the defense context is just absorb the profound banality that America's better at software than any other country in the world and especially than our adversaries. How much better are we. Well there I know of no like in a minute like we need I know of no enterprise software company outside of America that is would even conceive ever consider doing a bootcamp like me you can argue that others just copy us and you can compare ours there's no company is even going to respond to that. So it's like there are no large enterprise companies that I'm aware of in software in China there are basically the companies in Europe that exist are older they're not cosmetic in this country so there's there's is basically you know one of the things that's interesting about our our country is we're so good at certain things we underestimate how much better we are than others because it just seems normal but the tech industry the tech ecosystem of term I hate is unique from venture to production also we build companies that have a new playbook there is no playbook for power. So it's like so then you're ready for the world as it exists not as the world as it exists to 20 years ago so what is the conceptually and tactical most important thing about Titan is we became a software prime if we are going to scare our adversaries not kind of make them wonder if they should attack us and make them terrified to consider attacking us we have to play on our terms it's like an obvious thing about winning is you don't allow the adversary to define the terms of battle the terms of battle that the adversaries are going to do is not just to make a move on the way that we are going to do that. So there's a battle that the adversaries like are hardware because they have like very technical hardware cultures they don't have software cultures so the more we can do software empowered weapon systems the more it becomes our game by the way and there's just a lot of cascading advantages because one of the issues we have to resolve in this country is well how do you do enough manufacturing to supply the hardware side of it that's also a software problem how do you bring a manufacturing culture back to America so that you can actually produce the armaments well you can be like a second rate hardware culture. Or you can be a first rate software driven hardware culture and that that was the aspiration and that's why internally you have always asked thing like there's external excitement internal excitement we have Pound chair very excited about the Titan win first of all we won which is like you know and you know now we're like we are a large company we're profitable Well investors are excited about it investors are excited about it but you know you're earning the short sellers I love burning the short sellers like almost nothing makes a human happier than taking the lines of cocaine and away from these short sellers who like are going short on a truly great American company not just ours but it just love pulling down great American companies so that they can pay for their coke and the best thing that could happen to them is we will provide we will lead their coke dealers to their homes at the market after they can't pay their bills and that that's like one of my surely all short sellers yeah well you know go ahead do your thing we'll do our thing so as it relates to the battlefield you know you're you're talking about America's edge you've also been supplying our allies Ukraine and Israel in in two wars that it's hard to tell how they end when do you do you have any insight on that based on on your benefits to both and on the work that you're doing Well I mean they're very very different places with different cultures and different strengths and weaknesses on the Ukraine side they need America's help and the you know the funding there will be a very difficult position if the funding doesn't go through so that's that like what what they've shown is that you can massively outperform it you should be able to perform using software and that the that having people with software platforms that actually work on top of which they built is ideally suited for the modern battle situation. In Israel, there's a lot of our products are used are publicly disclosed in one place and not publicly, and the issue there is much more, why do most people in the world, and most people who are successful, support Israel? So why is it that so few of us admit that we support Israel? That's the central issue Israel has. It has a lot of complex, they're very complicated environment in the Middle East, an environment that is hard for Americans to understand. There are a lot of difficult choices that are none of them are perfect in Israel. They are obviously an ally, and we obviously stand by them. And I would say from perspective of Palantir, it's like Israel is known as the second best tech community in the world, and when they have a choice of what software to buy, they buy the best software in the world, and it's noticeable that they're... You have been, I haven't seen any CEO as I've spoken on the topic, and in public. In public. In private. You took out the New York Times full page ad supporting Israel. Part of it, some people will say, well, it's because you sell, that's your business. Well, Israel is historically bought a product, it's not a commercially relevant part of our business. And the reason why a lot of people don't speak up publicly is we have a lot of other markets that are much bigger where maybe speaking up as controversial, like the US and other markets. And so definitively was not an economic decision if you could critique it as an economic decision. I believe that, first of all, we have a precedent in this culture where people are supposed to speak up. It seems like they only speak up when the issue is either irrelevant, meaningless, or somehow it's something you can say that you don't believe that won't get you in trouble, and will allow you to sell products you may not believe in while pretending you have beliefs you don't. That's not how we roll a palatir. And when you come to Palantir to work at Palantir when you invest in Palantir or when you use our products. Have you lost employees because of this? We've lost employees, I'm sure we'll lose employees, I'm sure we'll lose, it's like any real, if you have a position that does not and cost you ever to lose an employee, it's not a position. It's some kind of self-pleasuring where the joke is on the other person or the joke is on you. And when you join Palantir and you dedicate your life to Palantir, I am standing in front of the company that people run Palantir, San Diego Company, not promising you to tell you something you want to hear. We're going to get as close to telling you how we see the world as we're legally and ethically allowed to. And we also do this externally. So when you buy Palantir, when I'm telling you that I'm going to sit behind the product or I'm going to sit behind a deployment, I'm telling you what I believe. Obviously business work's complicated, you have to make choices. But, and then there's over, this is not a small issue. From my perspective, it's not about just about Israel. It's like, do you believe in the West? Do you believe the West has created a superior way of living? Are you willing to admit you believe that? And by the way, the other thing it's about is, a lot of people believe these things in private, but they think they have the luxury of not defending them in public. It's just not true. Part of the reason we have all this scourge of kind of sicko-fantic, soft, thin, counterproductive, suicidal thought that has infected a lot of our large institutions is because the people who are doing important things who do not agree, they never speak up. If you don't speak up and the other side is the only plus side screaming, don't be surprised when a lot of people follow it. And so it is imperative on people to actually stand up. And yes, there will be costs, but the costs are much greater if you don't. Well, it's surprisingly unique to hear Alex. And a message I think there to fellow CEOs, thank you for joining us here at the Comcast Business Technology event. It's always good to talk to you. Catch up with you on a number of things. Huge pleasure. Yeah, Alex Carp, CEO of Palantir, guys back over to you. Always has the quiet part out loud. Take care. Great stuff, sir. Cheers.
