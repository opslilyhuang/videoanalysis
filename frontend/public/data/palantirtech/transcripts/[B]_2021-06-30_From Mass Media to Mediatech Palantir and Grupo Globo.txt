TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The Global has a unique difference here in Brazil, because we have a little like the PUBG, we have the channels of TV, the hardware, we have a channel of TV and we have the digital, with great relevance to the Brazilian group. The partnership partnership has helped a lot in this journey, and it is transformed into a media tech. This is because data is a critical factor of success in this company. Within the partnership with Palante, I would highlight three points. The first point is the power of the platform, the power of the product, the platform mainly Foundry, which is what is allowing our day-to-day. We managed to do this in management of our in-numerous data and a unique repository. We managed a corporate taxonomy that has become an extension of the advertising information of the company and we applied, not less, important to know our data scientists for the generation of insights and valuable services with our partners. We have a set of cross-sets and processing of super-granular information that we collect in our digital products and transform what was previously given into intelligence about the tastes and behavior that the users have in our platform. The second point I think is worth mentioning within this partnership are the new products that we managed to create together with Palante's channels. We make a support of competition to understand how the strategy of the investment in our different, our billion, and that's what we do in Palante. We make a calculation of what would be the best distribution of the company in our different months to have to money and digital. The third point, I think, is the most important thing, was that this partnership, in fact, caused a customer more purpose to transform what we were looking for. We managed to transform the teams, the way we thought of these teams, where decisions were taken every time more supported by the data, one of the biggest gains we had in this partnership. So, in fact, we managed to accelerate a cultural transformation within the company. Thank you very much.
