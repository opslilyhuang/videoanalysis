TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

At Palantir, we build next-generation software to help solve many of the world's most critical problems. For nearly two decades, we have embedded with the defense and intelligence communities to develop solutions that connect data, analytics, and operations. We understand first-hand the challenges of sharing information in classified environments with allies and mission partners. My name is Mitchell Skiles, and I'm a senior architect at Palantir, focused on defense and national security. And today, I'll take you through how Palantir Power Secure Collaboration. One of the strongest measures for deterrence available to the US and our allies is the adoption of technology that helps reduce friction and speeds time to decision making. We believe that advantage is delivered through the integration of secure software capabilities. Since our inception, we've built technology with data protection as the cornerstone. We leverage robust backend of federated access management and granular data markings. With security features like classification, role, and attribute-based access controls that facilitate seamless, secure sharing of artifacts and underlying data. Our solutions are designed to handle the most complex circumstances, operating across mission enclaves, security contexts, and partner networks. In distributed, contested, and disconnected environments. At Palantir, we believe that a truly data-centric force requires frictionless collaboration tools, but with security first principles at their core. With nearly two decades in the defense space, that's what we deliver.
