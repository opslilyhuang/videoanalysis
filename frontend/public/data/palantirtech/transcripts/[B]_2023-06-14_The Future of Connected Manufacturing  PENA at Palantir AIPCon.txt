TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

My name is Justin Herman, CIO for Panasonic Energy North America. I'm extremely excited to be here today. And during the break I was chatting to a few of the keynotes. And here's a common thread that's coming out here is the partnership with Palantin and how we iterate with Palantin to create business value. And today I want to take a little bit of time just to share with you the Panasonic Energy North America or Panhistory. And how we've partnered with Palantin to create value within the enterprise itself. So behind me is one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite leaders. I won't tell you who that is. I'll let you search that and see if you can guess who that is. But what do we mean by the impossible? What I'm holding in my hand here, I'm sure many of you know what this is. But this is the highest quality, safest, most cost effective lithium ion battery. And a sure of hands real quick, who drives EVs within this audience? Quite a few put their hands up and you're welcome by the way. They are between 3,000 and 10,000 of these lithium ion batteries in every single EV on the road today. In an industry that has grown exponentially over the past decade. In 2011 they were approximately 22,000 EVs on the road. And as projected in 2025 there will be over 23 million on the road. So demand is only growing and we need to be able to meet that demand. So at Panor we started our operations in 2016. We shipped our very first cell in 2017. We reached 100 million cells shipped February of 2018, a billion one year later. And to date we're shipped at a 7 billion cells. This type of growth is not only nice to have, but it's an absolute necessity. So how is this made possible? Well, it was made possible by the vision of Panasonic and its leaders, as well as our journey towards achieving industry 4.0. Now industry 4.0, as you all know, is a pretty loose term, right? We all have different meanings and exactly what that means. But let me explain to you at Panor what that means for us. So at Panor when we talk about industry 4.0 we really talk about integrating multimodal data into our manufacturing process. We look at upgrading legacy systems and manual processes and streamline them into more modernized versions of that. Discovering inefficiencies, but not just discovering the inefficiencies, acting upon those inefficiencies. And then leveraging the foundation of incremental value and agility to rapidly scale our capabilities through technology. And through cutting edge use cases, we build a framework of robust edge integration that we're unable to lock key capabilities for our business. What does this all lead to? What is the goal? The goal is to create a connected data infrastructure, which drives value. Where we can connect the spirit data systems, extremely fast and pull meaningful value from these various systems. This means, or this leads, I should say, to quality improvements, safety improvements. And also it frees up the time of our resources to focus on more value added activities. And of course there's always a multimillion dollar ROI associated with these types of activities. So where did it all begin? Well, we like to reference Panasonic Energy as a 100 year old company that really acts like a startup. And within our culture, within Penners' culture, we really take innovation and marching into the unknown as a core value and it's ingrained into our culture. And by partnering with Palantir, we will further enable that innovation. So right over here is a quote that our president Ellen Swan likes to mention quite a few times. And as you can guess, that group of 4,000 people is really referencing Pennam and is pushing into the unknown and building towards and meeting an ever-increasing need. So I'd like to take a second and dig into what really takes to achieve industry 4.0. At Pennam, we identified two challenges. The first one being a business value of a speed. And the second, the smart factory versus traditional infrastructure. So for us, developing use cases was absolutely critical to demonstrating key value to our key stakeholders. But investing in impactful use cases can be quite challenging and bandwidth intensive when you try to achieve this in advance of buying. In addition, when you look at the factories and the various machines and the variety of timelines that they were implemented in the data source that is producing, this introduces significant complexity into modernizing. So any amount of downtime for our operations can be extremely impactful. So of course, delivering value at speed keeps you current with the industry. But for us, it was really demonstrating value to our key stakeholders. And this was extremely important for us. And I recall one or two hundred pounds ago, I can't remember the exact question that was asked of Dr. Cop that his response to that was, take your timeline and cut it in half. And this was, this really resonated with us at Pennam because that is exactly how we think. And with Pennam, we were able to do this. And now you might ask yourself the question, how are we able to do this? And I believe the key differentiating factor for us was the ontology itself. So behind, you just kind of look at I chart, but this is the back end of our ontology model at Pennam. And it's taking all the disparate systems and integrating the disparate data into a reusable, highly valuable data asset. To worse, the ontology is more than a tool. It's really mapping up processes to create real enterprise value. Another I chart for you. But once you have the ontology and all your business processes can be contextualized within that ontology, you create what we call the manufacturing ontology. And once you have that, we can then connect through this any external systems to further compound the value, leveraging ontology SDK. So I'd like to talk to you about connected operations. And one of our use cases, this use case, in particular, is in our electro-control tower. And it was delivered within one month. Actually, the first working model of this was delivered within one week. It involved a highly manual process where our engineer would literally take a thumb drive, plug it into the machine, wait for the data, take that same thumb drive, visually inspect the machine, download the data on the machine, and then run it through their models. This entire process took about four hours. Within one month, we were able to give them the tools that took that four hour process and now condensed it down to 15 minutes with significantly improved data integrity. So five months later, what we're looking at from a speech value perspective is not only that one use case, we have six additional use cases. And these six additional use cases run over predictive maintenance, material traceability, really connecting our operations together and delivering contextualized data within the organization, which is driving value to our stakeholders. We have significant more use cases in the pipeline, so much so that our team is actually putting in some guardrails to make sure we can meet that demand. So to wrap it up, these quotes you see on the board are actually from our end users, right? Because at the end of the day, you want your end users to be happy with the solutions and the tools and the data and analytic tools that you're providing to them. And this was the reason why we have such excitement within the organization right now has to do with our partnership with the talent. The teams came together and the most significant thing that I saw throughout this engagement so far has been our talent came in and understood our business processes, sat with the operators on the lines, understood their daily challenges, and then took that and leveraged the technology to solve those problems. So this helped Pender find value that we ourselves did not even know was there. So in closing, I would like to thank the talent to the team for everything they have done for us. Our partnership is strong, we're at our infancy. I'm extremely excited to what we will achieve in the future and how we will achieve the impossible. Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoyed the rest of the keynote.
