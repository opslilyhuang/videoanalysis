TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

In Formula 1, being able to make split second decisions with massive amount of data from the car sensor can mean the difference between winning and losing your eyes. I'm Fred Bassair and I'm the team principal of the Scuderia Ferrari in F1. The F1 changed completely over the last 20 or 30 years that it's obvious that now we are collecting tons of data, not only on the car for sure, we have the track operation with thousands of sensors on the car, but the issue is not to correct data, the end is to do a good usage of the data. Here in Maranello in Ferrari we have been designing some of the worst most sophisticated cars since 1947. From the beginning our research and development efforts have expanded our collective imagination, our common understanding of what a car can be. The heart of our research and development is the vehicle prototype. This allows us to dream new concepts and then test their functionality, their reliability and of course their speed, their performance. Excellent cars are built from excellent prototypes, which is why my team is using Pallantear software to digitize the way we conceive new vehicles. So we have deployed Pallantear's vehicle testing system which is allowing us to analyze data for 150 different prototype vehicles. And these represents hundreds of terabytes of fluid data that will pass to the platform every year. This will be done thanks to Pallantear at an umbrella speed, level of sophistication and automation. And this is really a game changer for us. The vehicle testing system allows us to conduct a test with a greater precision and with more speed. We are able to analyze data that are coming from all the cars of our prototype. For example, data that comes from sensors mounted on specific parts of our prototypes or even the classic data of the telemetry after every test. The system turns the emergency of normal and normal data sources during these test reducing dramatically the time of years of normal. We use this software to reduce the time spent to collect, organize, and analyze our data. By upgrading our Pallantear's work, we are able to maximize the use of our data and transmit the sophisticated and guided data to the artificial intelligence. Pallantear can really help Ferrari to push the boundaries of engineering excellence. So I'm looking really forward to what comes next in our collaboration. Having seen Pallantear software prove itself at the highest level of motorsport, we know we have a platform capable and borr-ci of who records their attention. It's the shared pursuit of engineering excellence that unites Ferrari and Pallantear.
