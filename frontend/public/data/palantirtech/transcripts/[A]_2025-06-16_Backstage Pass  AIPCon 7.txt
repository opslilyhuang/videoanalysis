TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello everybody, welcome back to AIPCon. This is the seventh, yes you heard that right, seventh edition of AIPCon. My name is Amit, I've been covering Pound Chair for the better part of five years now and I'm honored to once again go backstage at AIPCon. Now in the previous AIPCon, the theme was really about agents and automation and this AIPCon is going to be more about connecting those concepts that have continued to gain momentum to a unified operating system for customers to get more value. To help me do that, I've got AIP lead with me, Jack Dobson and customer engagement lead with me, Nina Jacobson. Now Jack, this is the seventh AIPCon, you've been a part of a couple of these, what has changed since last time? It feels like more than a couple, better that way. I mean firstly, great to have you back, so excited to be back on backstage pass. What has changed, honestly, there is a reason we've made it to seven. I can't say much right away, we'll be going next tonight. We simply don't know yet, but every single time we run one of these, it's just that we are, it's a new era. It is a new story, a new set of stories that our customers are telling and that is really the reason we are back for the seventh edition. A reminder, all of AIPCon, like you would have seen the keynote so far, there are more keynotes to come on the livestream, but throughout the entire afternoon that you guys don't see at home, all of the content is customer lead. All of this event is driven by customers and the reason we put this event honest is those customers have new stories to tell. You mentioned agents and automation. Big part of this for me is really upping that ambition. We're talking about automating and building individual workflows. This time around, we're seeing people connect those workflows into a true broader operating system for the enterprise. That is redefining decision making at the organizational level. I mean, I'm talking about customer stories, but Nina, you are the queen of customer stories. You know, everything that's going on at AIPCon, have you seen that same sort of era shift in our customers? Oh my goodness, absolutely. So, you know, just right off the bat, you know, in terms of our, you know, second half of the day, our interactive programming, that is exclusive for our in-person attendees. We have the demo exo and the champions relay that I think are really pushing the limits in terms of, you know, what we're doing next with our customers. So for example, our demo expo, I have never seen customers scale so fast in my entire time at Palantir. It's truly remarkable. And then also with the champions relay, something that, you know, is totally new to AIPCon, we're, you know, of course, before, you know, we were very interested and invested in the transformation of organizations internally. But now we're seeing a transformation of the industries. So all of these organizations, you know, within, you know, manufacturing, supply chain, healthcare, working together. So it's really cool to see, not only do we see the value in the individual transformation, but also the ecosystem as a whole. 100% and the amount of creativity that requires, going to the theme, is off the charts, right? I mean, we literally have an artist who is painted. There is a lot happening. There is a lot happening. On this stage and over there. It's clear. It is pretty incredible. So speaking of creativity, the previous themes we've seen at Palantir AIPCon's space, time, shoes, shoes. We did have shoes. We did have shoes. We did have shoes. We do have a few other jordans. This AIPCon is focusing on art and Dr. Carp at AIPCon number two said that LLM's large language models are like artist colonies. How does that relate to the theme of art at this AIPCon? Yeah, it's a good callback. So, so Dr. Carp famously referred to LLM as these great artists. And I think this was truly cooling back to the idea that these LLM's are by the very nature they are generative. They are able to create this content. But I think as we've seen very quickly, like the LLM on its own is not the end of the story. You need the platform. You need the framework around that logic engine as it were to truly drive value within the organization. So, for us, what we've actually seen is a shift from the creativity at the model level to the creativity brought about by our customers. Building with that logic, building with our platform. And I think increasingly, as people tackle bigger, bolder use cases and build like bigger, faster solutions to those problems, the level of creativity that they are bringing to the table is incredible to see. So, we always joke about Palanty being a bit of an artist colony, a bunch of crazy artists. Our customers, everyone you see behind us are part of that community as well. Absolutely. And Nina, you've been working with a lot of those customers. Any sense of the art that they're creating in terms of applications on Palanty? Yeah, absolutely. And I say, right off the bat, creativity can only go so far if you don't have execution. And so, we all have developed this really strong execution base. We've got operations nailed. And now it's time to really get into what's next, what's scaling. So, I think it's really, really interesting seeing the speed and then also the collaboration feed into that execution. And then we can further iterate more into this amazing operating system that we're now seeing through AIPCon7. Awesome. Yeah, and the art that we're seeing just in the room and we have pounder artists, we have pounder photographers showing off their art, I think it speaks to the level of creativity that the employees, you guys have in this company, they make the company as unique as it is today. 100%. Yeah, I think Palanty has always been in place where, from a tech standpoint, the software does not constrain our customers. We don't force our customers to constrain to the software. It's the other way around, right? You wouldn't force Dali to paint like Monet, the same way you wouldn't force an organization to operate differently to its true core mission. So, we're actually going to have a set of customers join us here on backstage, for us, those of you who know the story will know what to expect, but a whole set of new stories I'm super excited to see told. Awesome. All right, so let's get into some customers. First up, we have Amy Ritulo, who is the Chief Data and AI Officer at the Department of State. The department has been using pounder to keep Americans safe in a variety of diverse and mission-critical situations, enabling some of the most impactful workflows. To hear more, let's take it to Nina and Amy. Awesome. Thanks, Amy. Thanks so much for joining us. So, we saw the department of state represented through AIPCon today, first off with Alan's keynote. Amazing, amazing work. So, we're seeing full representation from the Department of State today, starting with the keynote all the way through our last session today of Champions Relay. So excited to learn more about our work together throughout the day. Yeah, thanks so much for having me. It's been great to be here. This is my first AIPCon. The energy is incredible. And I'm just really appreciative of being around people who are super excited to talk about the work they're doing and sharing their lessons learned. Yeah, so Alan's presentation was great. It's a great demonstration of how we're using the platform in some of our most important workflows across the department. That's awesome. Yeah, so I know that he mentioned, you know, Orion and how powerful that's been. And it got me thinking about, you know, he talked a lot about the origin story of that workflow. And you know, in our discussions, you know, prior to AIPCon, you talked a lot about how the actual users of your platform are actually driving the development of that. So we'd love to hear kind of more about how, you know, that process works at the department of state. Yeah, sure. So at the department, our mission is to make America safer, stronger and more prosperous. We have diplomats who are delivering on that mission every day. They're maintaining relationships that have been built over decades. They're doing that in over 190 countries. They're working on thousands of policies and they're doing it in an increasingly complex global environment. So when we first started our journey with Palantir, we knew at the state department that general of AI was going to be, um, could transform how the state department worked. And so when we started this journey, we knew a couple of things. One is that we couldn't just build tech that was going to sit on shelves. Then they're done that, right? Yeah. And the other thing we knew is that we had to build tech that was engaging with our partners and diplomats across the globe. So we have been working with Palantir to start our journey of developing a generative AI chatbot that is called state chat. It is in a secure, safe environment that allows our department employees across the globe to put in sensitive department specific data. We built that based on an incredible amount of user feedback. So we had super users tell us how they're using it and what they want to see in the future. We did surveys across our entire user platform. And we just finished a feature ranking exercise where we asked users, we got responses from over 700 users of what they wanted to see next. So when we're working, so when we started about development, when we started that development, we also went out to our missions and embassies across the globe and said, how do you want to use this technology? And they told us, we want to be able to transcribe meeting notes. Our diplomats are going to bilateral and multilateral meetings almost every day. They want to be able to transcribe their meeting notes and do it on the fly. So when we worked with Palantir to build our mobile development, we built it so that our diplomats can take a picture of their notes on their mobile phone. They can then transcribe those, ask state chat to summarize those notes, draft an email and send it all while they're in their car on the way back to the embassy. That's really incredible. Yeah, we have over 40,000 users in the platform and they're saving about two to three hours a week. And the fact that you're operating those complex environments, I imagine that speed, that time of then not only summarizing that information but then contextualizing it, like connecting it to that broader ontology and enabling those change decisions downstream, that must be changing the way you operate, right? Yeah, for sure. I mean, we're really thinking about how to take this transformative technology and build it for our people. We're not out there building state of the art AI. What we're building is AI that fits into our workflows and fits into how our employees work on a daily basis. That's amazing. It's almost the sense of democratization within your organization in terms of the actual development of tech. Yeah, yeah, it's great to see. Awesome. Well, thank you, Amy. So much for joining us. Thank you for having me. Love it. Thank you, Amy. Second up, we have Sayed Zaydie, who is the vice president of Digital Solutions at International. Now they begin using Palantir to build an application suite for digital dealer, which enables their dealers to generate and connect more leads for vehicle owners. To hear more about that, let's take it over to Jack and Sayed. Awesome. Thank you so much for joining us on backstage. To get us off, tell us a bit more about your work at International and a bit about the partnership that you guys have built with Palantir. So we are part of a trading group. We have building buses and trucks with the solutions to support our customers. There is a lot of transformation going on with electrification autonomous. And then part of that is also building up an ecosystem that can support our customers in a good way. Wow. That's incredible. The ecosystem, we talked about digital dealer, this application, you're rolling out. Tell us more about that workflow, like the problem that it's solving, and I guess why was this the moment to go solve that problem? Yeah. So I'll give you a foundational level of information. If you talk about service department at the dealership, there's a lot going on. When the truck is broken down, we ring that to the site. And then diagnostic happens, technician needs to support, bars needs to be available. So there are many silos or pieces moving parts. And what we are doing together with Palantir is to rebuild up an orchestration and aggregating all of the information so that we can actively connect with the customer, bringing them before something happens, and then schedule them so that it goes through in a smoother process, bringing efficiency for the customer dealers and also ourselves. That's fascinating. We just heard those of you watching on stream, we just heard from Hertz rental cars. Yes. And it sounds kind of similar, right? Yeah. It's like if you can predict some of those movements, you can free the action to be your customers, the issues that need to be resolved. And essentially then that customer journey is as fluid, as seamless as possible, and ultimately improves the experience of your customers. Absolutely. So tell me a little bit about, I mean, I'm imagining like you've got dealerships all over the country, right? This is a massive scale of rollout actually delivering these solutions. So tell me a bit more about the journey of like how you've actually gone out deploying the solution, and what about our partnership is enabled you to do that kind of rollout. Absolutely. It's a lot about co-creation and really connecting to the real users. So we are still on the journey. So we started up with co-creating together with the dealers, with the real users, Palantir supported a lot really to connect how we can innovate, and then also learn from every step. We started with 12 dealers with 32 rooftops. But as of today, we are planning to expand it further. And the beauty of it is that it's a continuous improvement process. We learn more, we expand. We have implemented some of the AI, Genie AI, Kitches as well. And then it's an automation journey which we are all very excited about. Of course, 100% and maybe to wrap us up, tell me a bit about like with all of that in mind, how is that changing the way you think about the next use case, the next challenge? Like is this getting you to move faster? Does it allow you to go deeper? Like how's that changed the way you think about solving problems that international? The two major part is bringing value to the customer, of course, by improving the experience because that's the differentiating part. We are really obsessed about. And that cannot happen without really understanding the pain points and the dealerships of co-innovative, co-creating, working together. So that co-creation is key, right? Well, so I believe exciting. Good luck with the rollout. It's still in progress as you mentioned. Super excited to have you on the show and enjoy the rest of AI Peacock. Thanks for joining us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Sayed. Next up, we have Allison Jenkins, who is a senior technical product manager at GE Aerospace. Now, GE has been focused on accelerated production and supply chains, while also navigating compliance and different government restrictions to hear more about that. Let's take it over to Nina and Allison. Thanks, Timit. Awesome. Allison, thank you so much for joining us. It's awesome to have you here. Thanks for having me, Nina. Awesome. So, GE is an absolute tight-knit industry for decades. We've been pushing the manufacturing and supply chain parameters. Two out of three military aircrafts are coming from GE, and you guys were responsible for the first jet engine, pretty incredible stuff. So similar to Palantir, you guys run a very lean operation. How has that impacted not only your work in supply chain, but also your partnership with us? Yeah, absolutely. I think one of the main things about Palantir and GE Aerospace being a lean industry is that it's a good alignment when we actually get into an engagement with Palantir. So what it really means to me is that on a daily management standpoint, we all work together to win the day, to win the week, to win the month. And that's what our CEO has been asking for us to do is to have a lean culture. And by having a quick, iterative way of operating at Palantir, it fits very well into the model of where we're trying to go to support our supply chain and improve day by day to address our biggest problems. Absolutely. So in addition to running extremely lean, you guys also operate at an insane, just an insane metric. So when you create sort of operational changes, there's the potential to have this insane seismic shift. And sometimes that can be very disruptive. What's really exciting about our work together and our partnership is that we've addressed the speed and the agility at which you're able to then very quickly pivot. So with that in mind, what are you most excited to tackle next? Yes, I think where we need to tackle next is how we're going to manage this internally Palantir away from the Hobbits of Palantir, if you will, the developers who are fantastic shout out to Christian and Dox and Kate. But we need to get to the point of having that internally, that power of the Hobbits that are in our Palantir and Foundry space. So we need to work on what is our strategy for our digital roadmap on how do we bring a single ontology, how do we bring a single data layer when we have desperate systems, and then how are we going to manage that from a digital aspect, the traditional product management versus the new age AI prep work that we need to do. And in order to do that, we have to be able to talk about from a product management standpoint, what's the right way to address enterprise data management, what's the right way to address platform management and everything that we need to do on the ground to make sure that it's sustainable for the growth that we're seeing coming in from engine orders. That's awesome, and maybe to wrap us up. So you're talking there about the program management, which is of course critical. How do you think that's different on Palantir compared to like, I imagine obviously, G.A.R.A.R.A.S.P.A.S. all manner of software solutions and products out there, but program management, of course, still is of critical importance. How do you think about that differently when you're building with Palantir? Yeah, I think part of what's a little different is when you have to have one foundry ontology layer, when you come from a traditional product stack standpoint, you're thinking alignment directly to your business users for a specific product rather than how does it work across the entire landscape. So it's forcing these internal conversations for us to be able to say, okay, how are we going to do that across all of our products, which now foundry wherever that fits versus just delivering for your one subsect of the business to address a specific problem. We need to do it across our supply chain, and that's a very difficult task, I think. 100%. But that's what comes with building a new operating system, right? Is he redefined decision-making? Like, it's not an easy task, but it's one journey that we're super excited to be on with you. Absolutely. Awesome. Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. Alright, thank you, Allison. Next up, we have Brent Trolland, who is the sector vice president of strategic growth at Northrop Brumant. Now, Northrop has been using Poundtures' warp speed platform to re-industrialize their own defense manufacturing efforts, and to hear a lot more about that, let's get to Jack and Brent. Brent, thank you so much for joining us. Super excited to have you here on the show. I want to start with a little bit of a story, right? You're journey with Poundture. It starts in kind of a fun way, right? It's a similar event to AIP Con that we're at right now. Tell us more about how you came to be connected to Poundture. So actually, we had been working with Poundture for a couple of years on our mission side. We've been working on the government side, doing distributed solutions for the warfighters. We've been developing projects that we're working on together. At one point, I was asked to go to the Poundture Pre by your commercial side. I was always familiar with the government side. So I went up to New York City, December 23. And it was really interesting to me all the applications from the different companies where they were using Poundture to improve their processes, their back-end processes. One of my team actually saw me on YouTube and they texted me the next morning. They said, hey, I saw you on YouTube. We're really interested in improving our processes and manufacturing supply chain. And I said, I had the same impression walking through the Poundture Pre. So we got back and we figured out some projects that we could do. We worked with our counterparts at Poundture to find these projects and pilots. And we've been working on these for a year and a half now in terms of improving supply chain and production efficiency for us. That is awesome. So we came the influencer that influences this whole thing. That's brilliant. Absolutely mad. People know North America. I think you guys are the tip of the spear when it comes to empowering the war fighter, especially from a hardware standpoint. And then you've got to balance on the software side of things, equally mission-driven, but focusing on a different part of that mission. So with you guys fully focused on hardware, us on software, tell me about that partnership. How do we come together and what's unique about the way we do it? We actually deliver full systems. So full system solutions. Got decades doing that air and space under C, things like to be 21, things like James or the space teleco, things like radars that I work on. So I think the real mix of Poundture is we both really are focused on the mission. So that's a strength between us. And we both bring complimentary efforts into the projects that we're working on. So very strong. There's a lot of technical respect. I see between our smis, between the Northrop Grumman and the Poundture smis, are working side by side to really solve the war fighters most pressing problems and do that in a very fast sense of urgency. So there's very complimentary and really appreciate Palantir's experience and what they bring in terms of urgency and software to our system. That's brilliant. And then maybe looking to the future, with that partnership in place and us both focused on that mission. How does that change the way you guys think about the next decision you made, the next work for you to invest in? How does that change the way you solve problems? Well, because what's happening is becoming much more complex and solutions need to be done much quicker. So how we're thinking about it is really proliferation of sensors and systems and proliferation of data sources, whether it be our missions or on the operational floor. And so how do we leverage that data, this complex data, and quickly see the patterns and get to the right decisions. And so with us for the war fighter or in our producing products, that's our partnership with Palantir and that's where we see the future going. I think it's a very exciting time, exciting time for me as an engineer in just the pace is picked up and really enjoy the partnership. That is absolutely awesome. Two titans of the industry coming together. That's incredible. Yeah, it's brilliant. Well, Brent, thank you so much for joining us. I'm excited to see you the rest of the day at AIP. Great. Thanks for coming. Thanks for the invitation. All right. So, we have Joe Putra, who is the development strategist at Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh is a construction company that's undergone a massive effort to build an operating system to connect the fabric of their business in construction on Palantir. To hear more, let's take it over to Jack and Joe. Awesome. Joe, thank you so much for joining us. It's great to see you just hearing from Brent from Northrop. We talked a little bit about the journey of how he came to be working with Palantir, right? I just love the story of how Kavanaugh came together with Palantir and truly went about your development journey. They're very, very different way, right? Yeah. They're really innovative ways. So, tell me a bit more about the journey of like some of the work that you've deployed and like that mindset that you've had in terms of approach. Yeah, so our Palantir journey started like many others with use cases, right? So, tying together our legacy software, building things like cost reports, equipment, utilization, metrics. But we quickly realized that our manual processes and legacy data was actually holding us back. Yeah. So, construction and analogy, but we were trying to build on a bad foundation. We actually took a step back and asked ourselves what would it look like we just built this thing right from the ground up completely in Foundry. So, long story short, that's exactly what we did. So, this January, we partnered with Palantir for a six month intensive engagement. Wow. Transform our construction division. And the momentum's been so strong. We actually just extended that engagement with FTEs another six months. So, we're all in so much so that every other software must justify its existence. And we've actually had some instances where we've replaced third party software before we were able to even roll it out or make the first payment. We just built it in Foundry. That's incredible. Actually, jump me off exactly that point. I'd love to hear one of those stories, right? In terms of these workflows, that point you said around every piece of software must justify its existence. I remember you told me a little bit about one of the workflows, I think, of some HR software that was being explored, right? And tell me the story of how you came to prove that, hey, maybe Palantir's up to the task here. Yeah, it's really funny because a lot of the things we do, we treat as a lot of the inputs we make are actually outputs. So when you, a lot of people will do an org chart or they will do a cruise, but an org chart is actually an output of a properly organized employee database. And so we've been able to prove out that if you just manage all your employees holistically in Foundry, you can just output a beautiful org chart. That's amazing. We've actually built a lot of workflows like truck dispatch, equipment dispatch, tool rentals and things like that. We're actually going so far as now as replacing traditional ERP functions like payroll, AP, AR, procurement. And we're actually managing the development and roll out of our tools in Foundry itself. So we're not just building tools for the officer for managers. We're actually focused on making the people on site's lives a lot easier too. So at the center of our operating system is actually a tool we're calling Site360. So that's where field actions happen. That's the kinetic layer. That's going to allow field staff to do things like plan their activities, manage the cruise, book trucks, order material. Do their costing and approvals all in Foundry on site? And actually complementing Site360, we've built another app we're really excited about. It's our forward-facing employee app and it's powered by Foundry OSDK. So we're actually rolling it out to the app store in the next couple of days for testing. Wow. But that's where employees are going to be able to do things like see their upcoming shifts, punch in, punch out, book time off, update their personal information. Wow. Right in Foundry from their phone. And the best part about building this way, the holistic ontology, the pure ontology is that when you go all in, the information just flows. So in 12 months, we went from one user in Foundry to 100. And we're about to roll out to all 1200 employees in the next couple of months with Carbonara Connect. So we went from paper to Palantir and just over a year. That's incredible. That is brilliant. I mean, you mentioned there of going all in, right? Like a lot of companies obviously we work with, they talk about consolidation, they talk about harmonization. You guys just like, this is now the platform. This is the OS. This is a foundation on which you're building. And maybe just to wrap us up, like looking to the future, how does that change the way? I mean, you've really been focused on the decision maker, right? People that are literally handling the trucks and like, on the construction site are being enabled to build in the platform. So how does that change the way you think about the next use case? Yeah, we're really field focused. We're just trying to make everyone's lives easier. So the organization's seeing the power of Foundry, the owners, Jeff and Laurie Cabin are 100% committed. We're not just streamlining our operations. Like we feel like we truly are enabling them. And in by doing so, we're revolutionizing construction. We really mean that by building holistically, we're actually fast tracking operational AI. We're actually already starting to see the intelligence layer, the automation takes shape. So Palantir is not just making that possible. When you build this way, when you go all in, it's inevitable. Beautiful. Well, Joe, thank you so much for sharing that story. I'm excited to keep track of you guys. You guys are absolutely going to the moon. This is brilliant. Thank you so much, Joe. Thank you. Joe, thank you. We still have a bunch of keynotes left at AIPCon. Jack, what can we expect? Oh, what can we expect? It's already been a bad day. I don't know if you guys can hear on the stream some of the engine revs going on behind. I mentioned we had Hertz, you know, they've got one of only 25 limited edition shellbees out there. Like red, like people exploring it, people are revving that engine. There is a lot more where that came in. And you're a car guy. You like car guys. I have a car guy. If I'm not racing, I'm here telling these stories, right? So, no, that means so far it's been brilliant. Obviously, if you missed it, rewind. Watch some of those keynotes. But coming up, I think prevailing, the theme I want to land and actually Joe put it perfectly with Kavanaugh, it's not just a case of redefining the organization. It's not just one company. Each of our customers up on this stage are really thinking at the level of the industry. We've got city wealth coming up. They are transforming wealth management. It's not just transforming city, transforming the entire industry. And Joe is going to come out pretty fighting in terms of this is powerful stuff. They are equally all in as Joe from Kavanaugh mentioned. I am super excited to see more of those stories where people are thinking not just at the scale of their company, but the industry as a whole. No, absolutely. And I'll say, in terms of the afternoon sessions, the two big themes that I keep seeing is this incredible driver as it pertains to time and this go big plan. So in terms of time, we saw with Alan on the Department of States that their key note, paper to a completely digital EHR, 18 months. Absolutely incredible, unheard of, absolutely incredible. And then in terms of go big, I mean, we saw her just up on the stage just a few moments ago, 560,000 cars in over 11,000 locations. Unbelievable. All the tracks and the ontology. And insane. And then to pivot back to the Department of State, $100 million in cost savings. Wow. It's incredible. Absolutely incredible. I think the scale is mad and we've taught a number of different themes over these events. We've gone from time and the speed. We've gone to space and really increasing the scale. I feel like this artist colony theme is really releasing all inhibitions. It's really allowing our customers to create at the pace and the drive and the pure ambition that they hold. Right. And it goes back to that same point of customers increasing it coming to us like, what about this? What about trying this and literally pushing the perimeter of product? But that is about being aligned to the mission. It's like, your product is already giving me that foundation. I want to go further. I want to go deeper. And that is that creativity that inhibits all basically allows for this artist. And that's the community behind me. So I mean, Dr. Carp was speaking about this just recently about the idea that customers want to do more and the reason they want to do more is because they see results. He says they have the burden of value creation. As an engineering palter, what does it mean to actually create value for customers and only get paid if you actually create value? True. I mean, if I only get paid if I create value, that's how it works. No, honestly, I think this is something that's very special about Palantir. It's the reason I've been here for effectively my whole career. Yeah. But like the fact that every team I work with, every problem I work on, you feel the ownership of the outcome. Like, my customers wins are my wins. My customers losses are my losses. And that's not every software company. No, 100% and we talked about the forward deployed nature. We had a bit of that on the pre show earlier again, rewind if you missed it. But these customers, they partner with us because they're not just getting software. They're getting a mindset shift, a change in an approach to problem solving, which means not only you have the best tech and the best people, I may be a little bit biased, but I think that's true. But importantly, those people will take your outcomes as their own. And that is a level of ownership, a level of accountability that enables incredible things.
