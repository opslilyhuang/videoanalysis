TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm happy to be with you. We are in Munich, where we have a job together in one of the most important areas of the world. I ask you what we are doing together, how is it interesting and how is it so complicated? I'm really happy to be here today and that we talk about a very important topic. All the employees are a very important topic at the moment. I'm Kai Beckmann from the Merck-Ka-ga in Darmstadt in Germany. We both have been working very hard together for many years and have been short of the topic of the employees. We are in a different area. There are most of the most people in the field. There is a lot of people who are not interested in the field of work. There are many people who are not interested in the field of work. How will the employees and how is it so complicated and how is it so important to work together? I have always liked it. We are working together. But how do we have to work together? What are the skills and how do we handle the whole world of employees? I think this year has been a great deal. This year, the company has been working very hard and the company has been very important to all people. Unfortunately, it is not an outstanding project where there is little to do with it. It is a very high-specialised building part, which is a thousand different projects. It is a very different technology, which will be completed by various companies. A very special way to fill out the information in the car is to ensure that you can drive the navigation, that you can drive the car automatically, that the car can drive the car automatically, that the car can drive the car automatically, that the car can drive the car automatically. The whole thing is working in the cell phone. Every household is highly specialized. The processor is about a billion of transistors. Today, a handy processor has about 10 billion transistors that all have to work. All of them are very small. We talk about nanometers. They are very small structures. This manufacturer of such a chip has been operating for three months. That is not so, that tomorrow a machine is installed and the car is finished in the evening. But it is a three-month-old process of the beginning until the end of the process with thousands of processes. What are we doing together? How are we going to implement the Foundry? Why are we so excited about software to have the production of the hardware. What is the problem? We now know your explanation. That we have in the background a life like we have. We cannot have it without it. But why software, why can we do it? And software from us, what is the more value? Or why is it so important that we come together? And what will we be able to have from society? With the way? The production of hardware is very useful with equipment and tools, which are produced with the chips. And therefore, many materials are needed. There will be a high specialized material chemical used for that. There are several thousand different types of hardware used today. You can make it very plastic. We all have a school, chemistry, love it or not. If you take the system of the system, the help is needed for the hardware production. The help of this system is used. These materials are highly specialized, highly pure. And they have to be together to create the hardware in different processes. And why do we use the factory together? Because we get 1% of the same processes from this. We get billions of data sets, about the quality of the material, temperature, pressure and different things. And through the optimisation of this parameter, we can make the hardware process better. In the sense that it is possible to have higher output, so more chips work at the end. And there are many disadvantages. Because the output is a win for the manufacturer. It makes the things cheaper and better for the environment. Because I have a little less advantage. I give better impact for the environment. So the sustainability is a important point. And I can try new technologies faster. Because I don't use so many cycles, which I use the new technologies. And that's all the effects that our customers have. And for the world, when it is in complicated times, the cat's delivery cat has to be built up. So for a process that is not so complicated, that you can optimise the cat, then we have a world where the cars don't work. The heating doesn't work. The computers work, the power and not the functions. And it seems to me that it is not only an academic thing, but a thing where we are in the background to hang out. And the big thing is that it is not only the cooperation of two partners, but there are the cooperation of the equipment. There are different materials. So it is so many to many, so many work together. And that is of course the common data platform. It probably helps. Because the exchange standard is standardised and not two partners always have to be changed. Yes, this is also a thing that I don't understand most of the things. The cooperation of many companies is also a main reason to build. And that also sets out the data in a form, that is the opportunity to be treated as an operator. Then you need to know how it is very rare and software can be used. The important thing about data is that these cooperation is not often visible. So the specialists, who work really well, and highly-focused specialists, can of course not recognize these cooperation, which we can create in the field. At the end of the conversation, what parameters were the materials, where the influence of the effectiveness? That is a very new view on the things that we otherwise do not get in. Yes, it is interesting, where we are active, that the lay-in perspective is that everything is light-hearted. It is 100% knowledge-like. It is so far-reaching, so far-reaching that you can already determine the parameters. But we are not so far. So at this complete predecessor, there is a lot of light up. And we need this progress now, where the political reasons are completely complicated. Yes, there are more players, more candidates who play roles. And of course the danger that you have from the experience, I think the American name of the confirmation, you have a different name and try to confirm it. And that if you look at the data, it is completely different from the current. And that is what our researchers have seen, that you can look at the things completely differently, if you look at the data. Thank you very much. So that means a lot to us, to work together for years, to work on our platform, and to work together with you, and to achieve that, that such a big role is played and also the many companies that are involved in it, are motivated by us at Palentir, and is a big motivation for me. Great thing. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, we are in the pandemic together, we have worked without people having met, we have found that it is particularly successful, we have worked with how many countries, over three continents, Asia, Europe, and North America, we have worked with the pandemic, we have also seen the airport once, it shows how good the teams have worked. Thank you very much for that. It is very enthusiastic together, and it is still there, because we continue to work, and it is better to continue to work together. Thank you very much.
