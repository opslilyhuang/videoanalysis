TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm Chad Walkwist. I'm an architect. I've volunteered today. I'm going to have a conversation with Matt Thomas who happens to lead our fleet ops. So thanks for joining me, Matt. Thanks for having me. I always love to come to Arkansas. So fleet ops. What is fleet ops in your words? What does it mean? Fleet is kind of like our work with companies that, you know, cars, trucks, ambulances, so things that move around, like how do you like coordinate all those things that are moving around, making sure that they're doing the most optimal thing. But then like, growingly, I think the more that we go into, the more that that operation side of it kind of becomes really important because you realize that around has a great idea of what they want to do. Like you can definitely come up and know where everything needs to be, but how do you get your operations to actually have the intelligence at their fingertips so that they can then execute upon that fleet idea? So how do you improve your operations to be more, you know, effective? So things that move around and then how do you make the operations of those companies smoother at moving those things around? It's really about scaling it because it sounds like kind of on a smaller level, you kind of know what has to happen, but it's like, how do I do this with tens or hundreds or thousands of cars or trucks or whatever those things move around are? It sounds like a scaling operation. Yeah, it's kind of like, you can imagine if you run like a rental car company and you have 50 cars, you probably know the 50 cars off the back of your hand. You know all those things. But what if you have like 100,000 or 200,000 and it's across like six countries or you've got, you know, you might even not have that many assets, you might only have 50 trucks, but they're all in all kinds of places and they're run by different operators and you don't even know really what they're doing without like calling up the truck driver and saying like, where is that truck right now? So it's kind of like how do you bring, I always think about like a swan with bees. Like how do you make your swan with bees all point in the right direction and you might have known everyone's name at the beginning when you first started the company, but over time there's so many bees that you've just, they're just all black and yellow. So you're just going to make sure that they move in the right direction. And that's something that I think lots of people have been very good at doing that without software before, but as their companies grow further, like you said, with the scaling side of it, they can't keep up. I often kind of think about AI as kind of this infinite scaling of labor and expertise. And so if I can encode that into these systems and give it kind of some of the new AI tools that we have with AIP, this now gives me that that scaling mechanism with that expertise. That's pretty interesting. That's a concept, I think we're going to see more and more as it's not just automation. It's the skills. It's the skilled labor as well, not just this unskilled labor that we can scale with AI. Yeah, it's everything. And I think it's important word that you say that it's scale because it's not like how do I replace everyone in my organization, which I think some people come into and they think, oh, that's what AI is for. No, I think it's how do you bring everyone up to the skillset of your best operator? And then how do you enable new, diverse skillsets as well as skill sets that can be built on top of that with all those same people? Because those people are an asset that you want with as much intelligence as possible. And if you're not giving them the right intelligence, you can't expect them to be your best operator. You bring an important point though, it's the people at the edge that are making decisions that are really impacting. And normally they're making a locally optimized decision based on what they have in their preview. And then you've got someone at headquarters making this based on kind of what they see. And I think that's the bridge that Foundry is, it enables these people at the edge to create, to really make globally optimized decisions while also giving a better picture of ground truth to the corporate world to look across and how do I make these bigger strategic things. And I think that back and forth between those is so important. And that edge component or meeting people culturally in their place is the only way you get people to operate inside the software to enable that. I think that's so different than I see everywhere else. You know, the idea, you could such a really question, why do we do some of these things. And that's where I think you can start to get to real unlocked efficiencies in any kind of organization. I'm talking about fleet because it's where we see mostly these, but you're right, it can go across any organization. When you start to really think when the digital no longer becomes a problem, so main companies are used to the digital side of it, not it's digital transformation, but it's only digital transformation because it's taking up 80% of your time. Realistically, the digital transformation piece should only be 40% of it, and you should be able to use the rest of that to think about how can I transform the rest of my organization forward. IT should be getting out of the way and leading by example and being a tool rather than being the thing that you're pursuing for the sake of pursuing it. Which is what we see in the field, that's unfortunate. I go up to a mechanic or I go up to a paramedical something like that and I'm just there just like I'm done with this. Every time you guys come out here, it's to implement some new software for the sake of software. And I know, don't worry this time we're here for like you. And then they don't believe me. Then we go away and we come back the second time and then they're like, oh, I see, you're actually trying to make this for me instead for the software. Like software is servicing the people and so people servicing the software. And I think that's what that's actually what keeps me up at night most of the time is that, realizing they love these organizations that like we haven't worked with yet. There are probably people in back rooms like typing out Excel sheets, they're writing out sheets, etc. And you ask them why? And they're like, it's because the system needs it. I'm like, who wrote that system? Like, why do I, why does someone need to be employed to manually key in all these things? Like who's benefiting from that? You've now had to hire and pay for someone. Let alone the human hours that you've just wasted like, like, king that in. Like that's what keeps me up. It's like how are you people like wasting their lives and we're doing things that they could be, you know, out there enjoying their lives kind of thing. So, um, and that's where like we try to get to more the digitally led rather than the digitally like, overcome. And I think that's really the key here is you hit on the point of when digital is the hard thing, that's why it's the focus. And when we take that hard thing out of the way and it's really about, I'm transforming my business and now I can do that very easily because of these tools that I have. I think that's the how business can accelerate the real transformation that is enabled with digital tools and I deal. You never knew that there was AI or anything else. That's the really. Yeah, I shouldn't need to know what that word means. Like, it should just be there. Yeah. It's, I think it's also something that I, I groanly, like, AI is quite transformational in itself and don't get me wrong. Like, it is a core engine of how our software works. But I think, like you said, the best operator, they shouldn't need to know what the name is. Yep. That shouldn't be part of the selling point. AI in itself should not be the selling point. The value that's bringing to the edge, to the actual people, to those 10,000 bees and like the black and yellow bees, it should be, it should speak for itself. They shouldn't care who made the app where it came from. Any of that, it should just be like, I need this. It makes my job easier and I'm not having someone in the back room king and fucked fake data the entire time or I'm like not doing exercise that reason, which I'm sure everyone in their organizations has had to do at some point. Like everyone's had to succumb to some kind of IT process for the sake of going to an IT process. So that's like, and I think that's also like why not just myself works for Palantir, but a lot of the people at least on my team, like, we didn't join Palantir to be software people. Like, we joined Palantir to do operation problems and like operations. And software just happens to be the tool is the best way to lead the change or lead the optimization, lead the benefits for it. You bring out another point. When you talk about operations and like, and it's really around process mining and process engineering, you know, some of the stuff I see with like, is tools with machinery inside, greenery, other things. It's very much where now it's like, I'm creating my ontology that's kind of the digital, it's one of my business operations and I have tools to help me mine that for understanding the bottlenecks in my process, which essentially kind of to to to a tedism here of we've turned our business into a state machine. Yeah. And I think that's that's where people like merging both software and kind of process engineering, that state machine and like, I just have all these these nodes and pieces all over my business in different states. And I need to move them along through different states and through those states, there's different ways to get them to the next state. And that's really where I think the process mining comes in is like, how do I orchestrate this massive state machine in this optimal way? Yeah, how do you uncover those extra pots? Because like the ontology isn't just one, it's not just a semantic data layer that just says, you know, this or that, like, this is a truck, this is a part, this is a mechanic, this is XYZ. It's the process, it's the actions that happened to that. It's also the links between the things, which is how we do like, our complexly balancing workflows of like, that truck is linked to this location. So how is that like, the web of things? How does that kind of go throughout? But how that web is changed and how things are moving forward? You can go down to a small single process in machinery, which is like, you know, the process mining side of foundry. But you, it's also like how you start to think about the process and the wider scale. It's like, you're thinking about how do I encode what other things that I can actually push forward? Like, everyone has this idea of a conveyor in their head about their business. Like, almost everyone in some way or shape and form has a bit of a cycle in their head. But now you can really start to think about, well, I just got to figure out the process. And that's what kind of has back the process. I don't know, I'm like, dear, like, now you can start thinking about, like, how can I define that process better? And the software will just implement that conveyor but it's like, there's those video games that I haven't played for a while. I feel like Factorio was loving one of those ones. Like, I've seen some pretty wild factories that people build there. Like, that's fun. People enjoy doing that. Like, that's a real successful game. Everyone's business should be like that. It should be fun to build your conveyor belts and like, to build the machines and the state machines, etc. around it so that you're just pushing these things through. And yeah, let's make it fun. Yeah, it's interesting that the operational side of like, I create that model of the operations and now you can put in that kind of that customization. I'm always like, it's a long journey that we want to go for here. We create these use cases in days, but we want to create like an ecosystem here and we can do that in months. And normally it would take decades, I think, with like existing ITO infrastructure. It can take decades to get to the point where to be flexible enough to really bend to what the operator needs in the field, there's no software engineer who will like happily sit down and say that he can change his app, like five times a day or six times a day in an effective way. But you can do that with foundry. So it completely changes the paradigm of software development. So you can start to think about, well, these people in the field, they need this and I'm hearing these things and like, this is what my team often does is we get our hivers jackets on and we go out to the field and we put our style link up so we've got some internet and we just kind of like, we live, iterate next to the person about like, hey, if I know this, I can do a little bit better with this. And sometimes I'm going to be a sometimes they're nice and they know what to say. Sometimes they don't know. Sometimes it's just like, I've done my job for 20 years, I don't really have any idea what I can add to it. But at least now I can show them something. Like you can have it's hard to have a conversation with an operator and be like, I'm going to change your life. And they're going to like, bullshit, that's what the guy last week said. Like they've seen like 50 different consultants use of coming and said, I'm going to change your life by like moving that trash can over there so you don't have to walk as far and lay out of it. Okay, that is what they're going to say. But now like with founder, you can live show them the actual end product. And when we leave, they can just use it. Like they just get the link and they click the link and then it's like, here we go. And then we go the next site. And then we do the same thing. And that's when we start to go for that like organizational change. I think that that's the magic of when we say forward deployed engineer, like you're talking about putting on a high vis jacket, star link and you're sitting out there with a customer. I mean, that's truly forward deployed edge development. The fact that you can iterate multiple times throughout the day with a user as they're trying and doing stuff and getting feedback, that iterative cycle is magical because then they take ownership too. I think that's the other piece when you're doing that is those operators. Now you have your change agents throughout your organization because now they're like, this is my app. I help build this. I think that's such a like a transformational thing rather than some consultant and a suit came out here and told me I should move that garbage can over there. I think that's the difference is stark. I think that's what like with Fleet, we're trying to really get more of these things going because you're always going to get that customizability, that operator connection with the larger, like with the when you've got a hundred thousand things, you need that to really go further. But sometimes you need that for the smaller, the smaller guy as well. They need a little bit further or they just need a little bit more than the tool that's currently off the shelf because no one's targeted these Fleet companies. No one realizes that you can't get a lot of your deliveries on time without these Fleet companies actually existing or you can't expect your garbage to be taken out without these tools running. Basic functions of society stop running without these companies working. They need the best they can get yet. Some of these tools, a lot of tools that people using the Fleet space are using tools that will build for car dealerships or they'll build for other places that will like more monetarily attractive but nowhere near as impact driven. So I feel like we're having some interesting time now like trying to build some products within Foundry itself to actually attack that underserved market that we've seen before and actually gang them into like an actual solution and then eventually connecting into that wider like multiple different what we've got multiple different ecosystem that we're talking about. Well, thanks for coming to Arkansas. This is awesome. I really enjoyed the conversation. Yeah, it's been great. Yeah, I think we covered a lot of different topics a lot of different ground here. Yeah, I can tend to go into a few different areas but I think it was good. It's always there's a lot of different things that we cover Palantin. It's great to go into depth about some of these and see how far we can take them. Yeah, it's awesome. Thanks.
