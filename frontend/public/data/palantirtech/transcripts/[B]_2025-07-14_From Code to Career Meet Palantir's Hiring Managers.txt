TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello, my name is Varity. I am a group lead for Foundry and Hology and I'm one of the hiring managers for Foundry. My name is Don. I'm a group lead and Foundry and a hiring manager. I've been working here for nearly six years. Hi, I'm Austin. I'm a group lead and Foundry responsible for connectivity and security and I'm also a hiring manager. Hey, my name is Jack. I've worked for six years now. I'm a group lead of our core experience group. I'm a hiring manager here in London and a nice guy. I'm Matt. I've been working here for nine years at this point. Started as a Ford Deployed Engineer and then moved over to the software engineering side of the business. In parallel, I'm one of Foundry's hiring managers. I think recruiting is super important and I spend a lot of time thinking about our teams who are the types of people who can succeed and grow those teams and take them to the next level as well as who would make the most of this particular opportunity that Palantir presents. So in many other companies, you'll find a specific domain and you'll go directly down how do you solve something for aerospace or for oil rigs, for example. Here at Palantir, I genuinely believe we find 20 different domains and try and solve the most abstract hard problem across all of them in such a way that we can reproduce that and then find what's the next hardest problem. And we also have to deploy to a lot of very complex environments such as on the edge where we have significant hardware and connectivity constraints that are different than when you're only thinking about cloud-only solutions. One of the really interesting parts about how Palantir does engineering is just how small the teams are relative to the scale and ambition of the challenges that we're taking on. At a really big tech company, you might have a team of 30 working on something that at Palantir is just three or four engineers. There's nothing like a gravitational pull over real problem on Palantir. You find that Palantirians will go to the ends of the earth to solve the problem that they want to solve. We don't care whether the thing is within your teams products, a different team, a different org, a different company, open source software, in-house software, just don't care. We're going to solve problems that matter and we're going to keep running after the next problem. We are here to do the hard stuff that no one else can do. That's what sets our product apart and that's what makes the engineering challenges interesting, complex, and meaningful. The collaboration between teams is much less formal than you'd expect from a company of our size. Usually you'd expect maybe some team leads, we'll have to meet up and have several meetings until they've decided that they have like some long-term plan as to how those teams work together. Generally the thing that brings momentum between teams is like a sheer excitement for the problems that come across the desk. So it feels much more serendipitous and natural than the actual formalisation of some organisational leaders saying a problem is important. There's something about the fact that people on the ground are constantly able to partake in that process. You hire low ego people that really care about the value and the impact that they're creating but also really smart, driven, and independent. You put those people together. They come up with something great. It's actually quite hard to describe growth at Palantir. I found growth when I came to Palantir very interesting mainly because I came from finance and to me at that point growth was very much like am I going to become a vice president? Am I going to be an executive director? If you're looking for a ladder to climb then I would just encourage you to go apply to a big tech because that's not how we do it at Palantir. It's far more individual and it's focused on you. One of the things that I think is central to the Palantir experience is consistently being uncomfortable. We will put you in positions that are harder than things that you've had to work on in the past where the right solution is ambiguous and unclear and it's up to you to figure out what the right path forward is and I think it's through that continual level of discomfort that people grow the most by being put in situations where they don't know the right answer and then they get to learn both from their successes and their failures. You get to define what you want to do at this company. Really do you want to do managers things? You can. Do you want to do code? You can. You want to go in bed with a customer? Sure go for it. Honestly you get to figure out how to lean most into your spikes and avoid your crypt tonight. That's how we do at Palantir. I think it's important to remember that while the goal of the interview is to come up with some final product that represents the finished code or the solution that we deliver to the customer, at the same time I want to see how we collaborate, how you think through things. I'm trying to extrapolate how it would proceed if you were on my team at Palantir and I think showing me how you think through problems is just as important as getting to a good final outcome. There's no actual 10 step guides to getting through the interview process. I wish I could just like stare down the camera and say if you do this you'll get to work here but I think the most honest answer is be honest to yourself. We don't necessarily want to hear your sort of prepared statement of what you think we want to hear. So be real in the interview process. Talk about what you really like, what you dislike, what you're excited about, what you're not excited about and get into the details. I think we're always thinking of people as individuals. You can't build successful teams that all look the same. That's just not a reality of humans. No one is a completely well-rounded engineer and that is expected. That is what we want. That's exactly what we seek out. We seek out spiking individuals who can do exceptionally narrow and unique things and the interview process is there to show us thought.
