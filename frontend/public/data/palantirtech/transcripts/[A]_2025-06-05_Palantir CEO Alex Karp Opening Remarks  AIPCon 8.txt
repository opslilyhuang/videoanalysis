I Don't think in win lose I think in domination With Alan here talent here You're literally got it like I can't even tell you how many internal systems and replacing it with Alan here Our teams continue to develop new use cases for the boundaries of which we'll do real-time decision-making on the platform It was a mortgage case fraud case. There's a lot of paper Reims of paper it took our really talented investigators 60 days to detect fraud into these files It took your technology 10 seconds like holy You Please welcome co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Dr. Alex Carp Welcome welcome to Palantir and welcome to Silicon Valley Silicon Valley has gone through many many phases The most important phase was when it was fully aligned with the US and the West Which is how in part we won world war two and how we changed the world to become freer more democratic more tolerant more willing to listen How everyone's center of living went up and basically People learned to get along and then we have the last phase And then you had you had the consumer internet thing I I bash it all the time now It's kind of boring to bash these things as concern it Carsonogenic waste of time ways of Flushing our tone it talent down the toilet and most importantly They did not transfer any wealth to the populace either intellectual capital or Ways of organizing and so we got a very very divided West And now we're in a weird phase with with AI where it's like a very very unusual revolution and there is a And some people are doing very well The large language laws on their own. I think I've been proven to be somewhat Not useful unless you want to cheat on your homework Which could be valuable depending on the BS homework you're getting And it's a bananza for dyslexics like me because you know who cares about all that stuff you just you get paid for being creative and But this moment we're in with as embodied in foundry Antology and you is a very very special moment because there is a very selective Transfer of knowledge and opportunity to a very select group of people largely defined by are you willing to Evaluate things that work or are you gonna buy some BS ideology that worked in the past maybe it worked in the 50s Maybe it worked two years ago by and large in my view my view. We're not a money culture at Palantir But by and large is just set up to trick you to have no value But to feel good about getting dumber every day and We're not in that business at Palantir And our approach to the battlefield is exactly the approach we have in US commercial Which is why we grew 71% In US commercial with a rule of 83 which basically means we're doing it with no BS very little sales no overhead People are buying the product in its pure form the young people here would say We're like the pure drug on the streets high priced a real hit you feel good for days and it makes you stronger and better now I don't know if it's the right metaphor. It's not exactly my metaphor. I like fitness and um, but The the the the the thing about this revolution is that it's shifted the whole Silicon Valley landscape now The official version of Silicon Valley is a truly interesting once in a generation once in a International history kind of thing we happen to have it We have other tech centers where we de facto we dominate the world Mostly from here and other tech sectors that are outside of here, but in America and Even the Valley the secret of the valley right now the secret you're not allowed to say to anyone is Everyone's given up when randomly just sprinkling their dollars on startups You know what they're all interested in? They're interested in you growth Plus ontology plus foundry plus large language models They want you you know why they want you because with ontology foundry and Any language wise tomorrow that we orchestrate with you we can change your Uniteconomics to being pretty close to ours with your size revenue and Then you guys can also get up and pull the freak show act that I am and tell people who are insulting our country And who are against meritocracy and against free speech? Whatever you want to tell them Whenever you want to tell them you get the freedom because if you have 71% growth in US commercial and 45% growth in government like we do and you have a role of 83 or anything close to that especially with the way everything you get freedom And I'll tell you everyone here You tired of that BS investor who has no idea what they're talking about You want to grow your company because you're a world-class investor even quicker? You're tired of having some analyst who woke up on the wrong side of bed and decided they didn't like you because they didn't get into your company Or they don't like you because you're not cool enough You're tired in our case of being attacked by people who seemingly can't go online and spend five minutes looking at our Architecture but are so committed to being a product of their own weak-thin religion that they're motivated by being poorer and hurting us you have the freedom to tell those people to go back and suffer and sick fail on their own because of your Union economics and we are going to help you get there because that is a better world for you and a much better world for us and People in this room have already begun that journey Some of you guys most of you are at the beginning most of you people here who are exceeding are only using part of our product Use the rest We will subsidize you using the rest Negotiate with us. I'll tell you how you should negotiate with us I'll use the product in its totality and I'll move quicker than anyone else But I'm going to pay you a little less. So I see the results AB test our product against what you're using AB test our product against large language models AB test our product against the power points AB test our product against what the New York Times says AB test to get just AB test Do it on your own Negotiate effectively we want speed we want and need this country to be the strongest most important country in the world and We I'm super proud of our stuff on that battlefield and what we do To protect our soldiers to protect the data to prevent abuses of the data to prevent people from using that data to Weaponize it and to kill our enemies and Scared them because they know they will be killed. That's my agenda doesn't have to be yours But the single biggest thing that will make this country dominant and get rid of the parts of our country that are not Meritocratic and our whining about things they don't understand is to make industry in this country Look like venture did and give venturi turns to growth and that's what we're about a pound here And that's what we're this conference is actually about and you should negotiate very effectively with us and use the rest of the product And get a discount and run like hell because someone else is gonna do it and they are going to change their unit economics If you don't believe me walking around here in Silicon Valley and The key to dealing with Silicon Valley people which I didn't understand one of the main reasons they wouldn't invest Obviously was they at the time were not super into being pro-West being pro-America But another reason is we were like hey, we're gonna be really good We're gonna be build data systems. They're really valuable. We are too nice. Don't be too nice Tell the people here you got a week Trains leaving the station. I'm gonna change my business as you can unit economics in the next three to six months and Succeed and we want to be part of that journey with you and we want to be paid the single most unique thing that actually Palantir does is we own value creation You should pay us based on the value a subset of the value we create for you Test it. I hope you have a great time. I'm really happy to you back in the valley and finally we have a ball or intro We're gonna put this online. We usually historically have a little bit of dental music going By our product. We're trying to be better than any case welcome. It's great pleasure to have you here Hope to see all of you soon and we really really invest in you guys as partners We view as partners that also does that also means by the way we're gonna tell you what we think You don't have to listen, but we are sure as hell gonna tell you that that's not gonna work This could work they could work don't buy us by them That's what we do and Looking forward to having a long history with all of you take care You
