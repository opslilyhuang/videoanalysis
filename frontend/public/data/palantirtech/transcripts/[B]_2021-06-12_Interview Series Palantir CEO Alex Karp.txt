TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

And part of the... Well, you have to say what you've done, how long you've been at Palantir. I've been at Palantir 10 and a half years and I worked on product and in the field and everywhere and I haven't seen Dr. Carp in a long time, so I get to ask you questions now. Yeah. Okay. What has surprised you the most about being a public company CEO? You know, we've... Our narrative, which was... And will continue to be narrowly tailored to our view of what the foundational software of the future will look like, was one that, you know, often analysts had trouble digesting because if you're talking about civil liberties and building civil liberties architecture into your software in 2004, you're talking about building a software platform on large data sets where the end product is not a choice between finding terrorists and civil liberties but resolving the problem so that you do both. That and then moving to various other products we've produced. But like most notably found foundry platform where we're talking about revitalizing and if necessary, replacing or building our product into the infrastructure of a modern enterprise as if it was actually modern today with data protection protections, these things have been so far ahead of now we're talking about AI that actually is operational, at least in the kind of more clandestine context we're allowed to talk about it or moving some of those insights to the edge with dealing with the needed ability to interpret but also figure out the subset of data that's necessary while dealing with compute and other issues at the edge. That those things are so far ahead of the common sense of what's been done in the past that I've worried we would struggle to find people that would actually engage with that. Compound here is approximately 1.5 million investors. These are people who have taken the time to actually understand what we're doing but also if taking the courageous act of saying okay well what if some of the things that we've learned about how the world will work are actually no longer true and what will the world in a world where in fact what we tend to in shorthand call it alpha is directly tethered to or being generated by what we call software. That's a very strongly faith especially in the enterprise context because as most people know many software products are offer limited to no value today let alone aspire to be transfer transformational in the future. That's been a very big surprise that welcome surprise and then I think the other thing that has been pretty favorable that surprised me is of course we were very worried going into the the DPO that our culture would have to of course things have to change somewhat but I mean has the culture really changed more than it changed when we went from PG to Gaia to first commercial product which was unsuccessful to foundry to some of the AI stuff we're doing to now AI on the edge there's also required cultural changes and I think the cultural change of what it means to be a paleteer which is you get to you know work on the soft transformational software of tomorrow with some of the more interesting people in the world in your company and some of the most interesting clients outside of your company that hasn't really shifted in fact I would say in general it's been become in some ways easier of course there are a lot of institutional overlays and you know there's a constant pressure to save unless and so you know pushing back on that is hard there are some things of course that are necessary and then there's some bureaucracy that is necessary but then trying to calibrate what we can push back against I would say though the most important thing for me is I personally people like you who are long term veterans that paleteer very long term veterans in your case you've been through the bad the bad and the very bad and occasionally some really cool things you know we're sitting on a pile of things that you know you called equity that we're not only declining in value but we're a liquid and stayed and I had a lot of pressure to make sure that you know people who had you know invested their labor that you board the fruits of that investment at some point in the future especially since it's not the case that everyone stayed at Paleteer because of me but some people did and so it's like you know of course there's bureaucracy and other things and trying to do my best to not blow up the company with every statement I make but but the relief of not having this pressure on my back is enormous and very very free and so I I'm happy about that I'm very happy for you know the people like you who you know I mean you remember all of our discussions and when Foundry started it is like and whenever the thing is when you're working on products that are not understood like most people have like a report of what other people have done and then they're going to try and make it a little better and higher 5,000 people to sell it right Paleteer doesn't do that we've never done that then what we do is we have lots of clients that are working on really cool products and we begin to kind of iterate on what are the underlying problems that they're of which they're not mostly aware that would solve pre-solve not only the problems that they have but the the the negative externalities of solving that problem so very similar to the negative externality for most people of stopping terrorism was forgetting about civil liberties the negative externality of protecting civil liberties was you had terror attacks how do you solve both but not that different like how do you actually get an algorithm to be so functional that it is approaching what or becomes what people call AI in a context where data is unlimited how do you push that to the edge how do you get Foundry to install in hours in a context like COVID so that you can actually distribute the vaccine where the databases like in the UK are massively siloed and the and the problem is a question of that you the answer the problem will save thousands if not hundreds of thousands of lives but we were working on these problems before there was COVID it's like there's a narrative like well suddenly COVID came and then Paleteer flourish but like we built a product assuming disjunction and we've been building this product you know and then there's what does it mean to build a product there's been many iterations of course you know the original insight was how do you manage transforms at scale while protecting data okay but that's a very broad it's a very broad in a statement to problems and then there's a specific solving the specific needs of each client while building in motor that is universally applicable is requires a kind of depth and elasticity of the software and the code that very very few institutions could even really approximate an understanding of yet alone build then you know getting managing that at scale so that we don't have to change our culture which you know Apollo looks to you know Wall Street analysts to you know you take the time to actually look at our products which is not enough honestly but but as like a unit economic neurona and that that it is but but the reason why Apollo is important to us is not purely the unit economic neurona neurona of allowing us to manage you know presumably limitless clients with the same number of resources it's that it's a cultural neurona that allows us not to hire we still roughly have the same number of people we did a year ago and you know it's like and then but but our but our companies expanding rapidly and that allows us to have a very narrow tight and specific kind of culture while having a broad ability to service the world with our software yeah i was going one of the fun parts i feel like for me is they see the external like the individual investors like explain foundry to each other or explain what we're doing to each other and it's kind of cool to see everyone grapple with it's a favorite riff there i have lots of like like like like just that they understand they take the time to understand the tech like during like demo to demo day and the deep dive and stuff that be like engineers like if they can actually do this this is insane like i see people like we've never been able to show the product externally it's like if you're not a client you don't really get to show and tell us like yeah i find it super hardening to you know when we interact with people investors and others who are technical don't enough to understand the problems we've solved yeah and then have taken the time to go deep enough into the product demos to understand that you know we've actually solved a lot of these problems and it's enormously gratifying to have an external concafany of you know interest where the interest is pretty technical it's like it's it's it's it's surprising how much time and energy and thought the average person puts into understanding our software that's the positive the negative version is how little time and effort some of some professional analysts take in understanding what software is since it's their profession so it's like you know you they often can fleet you know buying wrenches where you may not really need to understand the delta between one wrench and another you just can look at the like the the lagging indicator with sales now obviously our sales are kind of going very well but what's powering it is our products that are just differentiated is way too modest they're completely unique and both in terms of how they're built and how we service them and how we interact with clients and how we're building currently also look at the speed of our product development over the last two years it's actually you know sped up sped up it completely is just while building while doing a DPO while creating a sales force it's like we're accelerating on all fronts yeah yeah who are we it's related to the people who are actually deep diving into our what's available like has it who are we looking to recruit now it's a changed no I think you know much to this a grant of Silicon Valley who was investing in you know consumer internet apps and various products that are largely at best described as Carson Agents on our society and as worse decided as as like hyper Carson Agents that transfer all the alpha away from individuals to a narrow set of people we've been able to retain and recruit the very very best people since inception and this is like as you know been a constant frustration for Silicon Valley that we disproportionately got the best people to not only come to Palantir but stay and we are still very focused on recruiting the very best most inquisitive hardest working insightful technical to primarily technical talent in the world from any place we can find it and I would say on that note like our recruiting is is like our ability our retention our ability to recruit at because the net has gotten wider or people know who we are but also because as technical people engage with our product because they may just be looking at it as like an investment option and they're like wow okay this is real and so like what we're seeing internally is we're getting our hit rate and getting people's going up the quality is not typically when people IPO the quality of people you were able to recruit and retain goes down I don't think that's been the case for us because before we were we were very much niche so if you were at a super elite school who you might know people work at Palantir and therefore you would know the quality of the engineers and the products but if you weren't you might not know it now if you're just sitting out there anywhere in the world and like you're like you've probably heard of us and you're like you know engineers are very very skeptical as you know you're an engineer really so if somebody's claiming of this product has great software what's the first thing you're going to do go think oh this isn't great I'm going to go check it out and it's like it's usually by the way not so great it's usually like 5,000 salespeople and a completely rusty product that was randomly written somewhere and has limited utility and and and and this and and negative utility in most contexts outside of what it was created so you come to Palantir and you know it's like you just go looking at Palantir like okay well let me look at what I think they're doing with the code base you know like wow that's cool that's cool wow that's super cool this looks like a problem they're actually working on that they're not yet talking about I'd like to be involved and then of course once you've gotten past that hurdle then you look at the quality of the people and you know technical people have a very precise ideas of what that would mean i.e. people as good as I am or better and so then you look at internally at Palantir and what you're expecting to find is a technical person is 50 marketing people that claim they they know software because they stayed at motel 6 or they worked at a bank covering software in the 80s but have no earthly clue what we're doing now what you find is like leadership that from beginning of the end actually is working on driving these things and that that just leads to a recruiting charisma and we're so we're you know really seeing very strong interest in joining Palantir last not least we've run the company primarily for the interest of you know it's like for the people of Palantir and I would say you know you know part of what has always made me and still makes me an economic progressive is you know we ran the company where everybody has a part in the company it from an equity perspective and participation of Palantir we also give people a Palantir enormous responsibility which is appealing if you're you know you know you just say you you've just left school and you know you believe and maybe are the world's best software engineer of one archetype or another do you really want to work 30 years under somebody before you actually get to write code to the to the trunk or do you want to be working writing code that's actually used from people that might actually know some things about writing code that you didn't learn in school that are actually that are at your level or you know conceivably better and so that just like that leads to this very positive dialectic and and I and I and I believe internally it's like look at the quality of the people we have and then you can imagine these people running Palantir like when I you know now they're officer you're opening and I'm making an effort to meet people I I see people who will be you know running parts of Palantir in the next couple years not people that are just going to be working for the Palantir version of the man yeah so you know and that's really really cool yeah yeah yeah it's fun when I interviewed I in 2010 I had no idea what the product did because you couldn't see it you couldn't go interrogate it until a month into working here then I understood for but now well you know but that's you're being overly charitable then you got to see that the the government product was real but had some real flaws in the code base and and had certain things that had to be extended yeah and you saw that the commercial efforts were nascent at best and and that we weren't exactly sure what we're going to build and we were kind of figuring that out or in your version would my version would be figuring out your version would be failing so you know yeah what do I mean speaking of that was since I was part of that first wave of commercial US what feels a different about this third wave or you was commercial well I mean I could ask you but I think I know as to first of all foundry is objectively the best commercial software product in the world and and again don't you know feel free to judge it by the numbers if your technical go look at the product but you know a simple way just look at the people it's retract attracting to work at Palantir they go look at foundry you're sitting there as somebody who's a world class engineer that wants to work somewhere and they go look at what we're doing and like okay I want to work on that that's why we're recruiting is so strong post D.P.O which again is like highly anomalous so I mean you know we didn't have you know our first commercial products were failures and that that's not actually there's a tendency unfortunately outside of the US and it's one of the reasons why the US is so strong in this that we embrace trying and failing right so it's like that there's no shame in our failures it's like we learned a lot and we we applied it to when we we started building a foundry but like the we have the best product in the world we have we have also a stature and access that we didn't have before we have resources we didn't have before both financial and reputational and and we have a lot of knowledge about how you interact with an institution and how not to interact that I would say we you know probably matured at least in our actual clients it's not perfect it's very hard if you're a software if you're a technical purely it's still the case 70 plus percent of Palantirians that come are technical and another 10 maybe even more maybe even 15 percent of the people who are not software engineers would be called engineers at any other company those kind of people the people that we attract and work hard to retain don't always interact well with institutions that are 85 percent non-technical and so that that's always going to be a problem for us it is we're getting better at it but obviously it's it's never going to be perfect and and so that there'll always be a way in which you know Palantir will over perform technically compared to other institutions in my humble opinion dramatically outperform any other institution in the world on the software product I mean if you just look like normal companies have one product that is 10 years old and then they're acquiring people acquiring companies and there's a lot of technical issues in that that are massively underestimated because like actually these products are the code bases are not meant to come together but even culturally there's obviously enormous issues Palantir has built what amounts to hundreds of products like foundry is hundreds of products in one product fully integrated and now will be made also fully fully disintegrated so it's like we're we're really really good at that anonymously good so we we significantly outperform all others on the technical development and delivery and again we deliver we we're over we're we're we're outperforming people if you do apples to apples today if you do apples to apples we're simultaneously betting on what people are going to be doing tomorrow and then so it's like and then it's like a Hagellian thing where when you get to tomorrow the stuff that even if it worked today is not going to work because it doesn't conform to the expectations of what enterprise is going to have to do in five years and then you saw this in government with PGA we saw it in the operational context with Gaia we've seen it you know on the data protection side throughout the history of our company we saw it in like the modularity non modularity of foundry its ability to integrate massive data sets in a COVID context we have limited access to people we've seen it industrials and supply chains we've seen it in in emissions context reducing emissions and in producing more efficient motors we're seeing in the AI context but like but the but you always have to if the if the curve is like this in our production and the normal curve would be like that in software production the the monetizing the curve so if like a normal company would produce this and then they'll monetize this we produce like something that like is nearly unbounded but then we have to do that because our monetization will always be less than than than the curve itself whereas actually what most software companies are doing is they're producing a much smaller integral of like actual software production then then the then the revenue they can extract from that production whereas we're producing a nearly underbounded integral where we monetize we we have to learn over time how do you actually extract revenue value out of that because where the full value of the integral shows up in five years in the in the common sense consciousness of of of of of of more of more kind of conventional businesses and and financial people and so that that's like that's that's another reason why internally we have to be so focused on building this like transfer of transformational software that's existential to the future and highly relevant now because we will never compete on the access of extracting more value than the value you've created that that other companies are just much better at you know and so that that's but but but so that that's our disability and we should we have to just be completely cognizant if you're going to ship software built by people that are basically nearly all technical to enterprises that are learning how to to work with this specific specific kind of technical product software it's different than working with a mechanical product you you have to massively outperform on the quality of the software side or you will you will be it'll be disaster because you're not going to outperform on quote unquote the sales side and that's just that's what makes our business very special independent of the like the very cool things we do and like these ones the pure kind of economic vulgar side of our business is just different than that of a normal software business because they're they're they're very often the products are thin and old but the sales are new and fresh these like conventional companies that have thin product and then you know heavily on the sales is that that's what they pros at some point when they made the product then they stopped and it's very hard you you have to you know the the genesis of the product and what it became are often different I mean very often the genesis of the product are being done by people that we we would welcome and would love to be a pounder but then it goes into kind of this this this this this what you could view as like a digestion system that digest that core product into a more conventional way of delivering it which has enormous benefits because you can take a product that has an objective value of x and sell it over 30 years for an objective value of 30 to 50 to 100 x right the the the problem there is the culture that can actually do this is really horrific at building new products so it's like they're they're they're great at taking something and like taking its value and then like the revenues go out like 30 years and the from our perspective the product was already thin and maybe emaciated and and has attributes that wouldn't scale and then and then but then but but but but but you know but they can do something that we're learning whenever B is good at is there which is like they can take that and then extend the revenues and so it's like from it from the perspective of the kind of person we're recruiting and entertaining this kind of company's just not interesting right because like real world class engineers don't want to work for like a the the world's most perfect sales machine right with a thin product and that's the problem for them and that's why these companies have to really really do acquisitions acquisitions are are often fraught with technical issues and cultural issues that people underestimate but they but they have to underestimate them because that's just not they don't do product development and so what what we do is we are building these products that are just like massively valuable and then we're we're we're allowing the macro conditions to catch up with the product that we built it's actually quite dangerous because you know if we're wrong about the macro conditions we're wrong about the product development you know like right now people talk about GDPR they talk about protectionism if it's a normal thing you know you were around even at a time where this was like super radical like so and like you're going to see the same thing on like our bill the way in which we approached AI completely different than anyone thinks the way we approach operations in the in the special forces kind of completely different the way we're going to move that the AI technology is these are we're building on assumptions that are not broadly accepted but they will be accepted we're betting on that and I pretty certain we're going to be right about realizing it's already seeing that the operational output is the delta is much greater than what everyone else has done that's highly charismatic to people the the people we need to come to paleteer by the way it's also charismatic because the culture at a cultural aspect if you're doing this just makes technical people feel at home like you're not going to feel at home if like all if it's like a whole apparatus now of course as we've become you know a public company we've had to overlay like sales people and other things and you know then you know engineers run around say you know like are afraid like are we going to become like I don't where obviously not going to mention names but all the companies that you know engineers don't respect that Wall Street people sometimes love but like actually our technology are like just not charismatic to technical people because they they're not actually solving real technical interesting technical problems or the problems that they're claiming to solve are not never being solved and so but you know so like are we going to become that and the the honest answer is of course not but you are going to have to see that we're going to we're going to have to change and adapt you know and and and actually find ways to make sure and and by the way not just for the revenue it's like the way in which like the the more vulgar economics of it are right is revenue is a sign of impact in the sense that you actually got someone to deploy their product and pay for you and we've been exceedingly good on that score that's why some of our contracts are so large in media because people see the enormous value we create now we've got we're going to democratize this in the sense that more people are going to see that value but that that's the internal dialectic but but but like from an internal perspective we've moved from like here to here and probably from an external perspective here to here but every other company is like you know 5,000 kilometers in a different direction on like these things and like we've moved a kilometer so it's but but that's that's that that that's basically have you noticed the sales people what are the sales people I'm I'm so deep in product development that I don't notice the change that's the best that's the best thing that we want to hear it's like the best thing for us is to have very impactful people who are selling our product that the product people and the people are managing our culture don't have don't really feel the impact of and so I'm super gratified to hear you say that I think I think we know for us also it's like it's just not of course we can't just run out and hire like replace ourselves people sales people that come from other companies because it's it's one thing to sell a product that is like it's like a plus b plus c minus f it's another thing to say we're the whole alphabet and by the way they're we're the alphabet of the future and you're not going to recognize everything we have you don't have real criteria to evaluate but it will work and over time you will find you will understand why it works and you will not be satisfied with these things is like the the thing that the thing that is really interesting about Palantir is once you've bought Palantir you're not particularly happy with and you've used it and it's been implemented in a way that actually works as a hard thing because there's a cultural change on on both sides probably to actually use the software of the future today and we've seen this in every context not just the military not just Intel but across industry but once you've gone through that you're very unlikely to to be satisfied with what you're going to get on the market and this has given us one of the reasons we've survived despite our charming personalities is people are like yeah the personality's a little bit odd but the software is really performing and the more you use the more perform it you it it it it be concert people but yeah there's a big cultural issue there yeah is that now that we're working or we're open to working with smaller companies as well as big ancient companies is that should that change how we we know the spec things as an example I think there's a lot of attention on the specs because obviously we're investing in some of the most interesting creative companies in the world and and they're relying on foundry to you know get the business to a point where it can really be even more disruptive but outside the the one of the coolest things obviously that it would be hard to notice externally is these people are going to push our product and help us understand like you know we shouldn't we can't rest on the fact that we're five years ahead of people but tomorrow you're you're not five years ahead like so it's like and these people pushing pushing our product and pushing what they're what they're going to do these are relatively small companies and but compared to and like but they're really pushing us to work on and by the way it's super it's super inspirational it's like one of the things that's gotten us through the bad times you were here for a lot of times that were not great was our customers were so inspirational yeah like the nice thing about some of these small companies is they're inspirational they really push us to build things to do things that we hadn't done before in ways we hadn't thought about and like to deliver value that is is not you know maybe not in a way that we had preconceived so I I think like you know it's easy to focus on like the biggest customers and and some of our biggest customers are also some of the coolest customers in the world no doubt but a lot of these agile kind of custom customers were interacting with either because they're buying our software or because they're using our software are they're just under the gun yeah and they've got to produce they've got to produce products that are you know to win as an unknown quantity you know we used to run around saying we were truthfully saying we were five percent of the cost one percent of the time I believe this to be still true so what I would tell any entrepreneur that thinks they're going to disrupt you have to be 20 times better at least so it's like and you know like if you think you're going to disrupt with like you know some linear kind of you know we are better on this axi but worse on that axi and it's very linear that's not a tech business and you won't disrupt and so like we we shouldn't forget that a pound here by the way it's refreshing to see other people that are living and breathing that because we cannot afford to ever forget if if we're not demonstrably better than other people no one's going to put up with our charming personalities and that that's how that's why you and I get to sit here you know it you know here we are sitting you know outside of Zurich and mountain doff you know we have we get to to really dedicate ourselves to our what we care about with a lot of freedoms and it's not but we only have those freedoms to dedicate ourselves because we what we produce is rare and highly differentiated and no one puts up with us because it's just the same thing as everyone else but a tiny bit better that that's what normal companies can do like so these companies that like you know you don't respect enough because you know you look at the quality of some of their tastes like but like but they do things that like we can't do that we we we we we must never try to we will fail yeah they're much much better at that than we are yeah one thing I wonder I mean the SPAC companies though like they're they're so ahead of these ancient companies that like when we help their supply chain problems it's like I can see that it's going to advance our edge a lot is it too far ahead of our old companies or is that inspiration for the client is it supposed to serve as people love to watch people with you know one of the things about a lot of the best companies in the world that and some of which are older is they they they know they have to adapt and it's watching someone else who's adapt quicker adapting quicker and using our products in ways they have thought of we'll get them to adapt and that that's a good thing for everybody I would say that what's special about the American market in particular is its ability to adapt it's like the adapt adaptability flexibility of of of the of the of the American market is very special it's less the the high level of confidence outside of it America is also very special but the adaptability in America is really unique what why is why is America so adaptable I don't know but it's like well I mean it's like I mean there's a longer an election answer which is it's America was this isn't the American perspective of America but like the there's a very basic fact of America which is that you can create your own church or synagogue or mosque but not just you can go into a society and be Christian Muslim Jewish or something else you can literally decide what your form of Christian Christianity Islam or Judaism is and then it's just true so it's like this ability to like freely define your culture and your belief structure but then hold yourself to that belief structure and then change it again another time in life is very very unique and and I don't know of any other cultural in the world that has that if you combine that with the constitutional stability of America in some ways though obviously there's a lot of political battles you just have an ability it's like a whack certainly in the business context it's a whack there are there are ideological trisms taught at business schools but like there are a lot of people like me in business and palatir who in in government you know like it just like you know we're very open to things that actually could work especially in our case things that will work in the future but it's not it's not doctrinal yeah yeah and that that leads to a kind of an ability to look at something and say this looks weird but I'll give it a try and then when it looks weird but really works it's no longer weird it's and then this is just a maximally advantageous you saw this like in the in the the US government context it's like when we got we started selling our product we were saying software is not something enough to tell you this as an engineer is just having a thousand specks of what you think it should do in the way it should work in the future only makes sense if you want to spend money for something that doesn't work if you want to spend money on something that works you you can pay less money and you show it working today okay common sense to every engineer not common sense to most institutions still not enough common sense to most governments in the world so if you look at what happened in covid the governments that took what was not common sense that the US government became common sense so like that's how software increasingly is purchased is one of the reasons we're doing so well there became common sense to say the government of England and innumerable other countries that's why they bought our product they didn't buy it because they particularly were buying into my German PhD and my cross-country skiing or palantir's narrative or anything in fact many cases they bought it to spite that most cases maybe yeah but they learned aha software is not something that exists on a PowerPoint it purely you must see it in action yeah and then and by the way this was very much linked to other good decisions that were made so it's like it's a learning process and then the question is how quickly can a institution or society learn and it's not I don't see I don't think like where you think it's a question of new and old or a new old ancient I think it's a question of how adaptive some older institutions are highly adapted because they use their culture to reflect on their core values and then they use those core values to be maximally flexible and adapt adaptation some newer institutions startups whatever in all areas are actually highly highly rigid and not flexible and not adaptive and they fail so it's like I don't think it's a question of new it new fresh that it's a question of how willing are you to absorb an idea that looks odd to you and test it under quantitative considerations and then learn from the output and institutions and societies that can do that are going to dramatically outperform and then then there's another thing here that just is not believed at a common sense level so what I've just said to people are like yeah okay that makes sense and blah blah but people lay non-software people just view software as normal technology so like one camera is 20% better than another camera but then they capture that difference mostly in price so you maybe you pay 30% more for a 20% more better camera and then if you've got lots of attendees that you don't care and then but if you're highly technical you find the camera that costs 20% less that's 10% better that'd be more like the engineering approach and then you build some new thing into it and you've got the best camera in the world at a cheaper price right so but but software is not like that it's like it is the best software in the world is it's binary like if you look at the way we build software like using you know revisioning database the way in which people write software and using it to manage data okay that approach is not just 20 but it's not 20% better it's like create a new world that in its output could can go into do things simultaneously or maximally contradiction or contradictory to most people like being able to power rebuild the whole supply chain of a country while protecting civil liberties norms and being able to verify that to third parties while applying both technical like physics models to supply chain and human analytics for people that you know are doing is like simultaneously so this is like like the lay way of saying it would be it's like a thousand times wherever it's not even a thousand it's like you create a completely different world and people struggle with this because the common sense version of it is well you know it's like hiring a lawyer or buying a camera you kind of roughly get what you pay for its price you could hire more hours from the bad lawyer and it'll be as almost as good as the good lawyer or like the technical version is you know like buying a car blah blah blah that's just not how software works and it leads to massive societal problems because of course it leads to massive societal inequality and so that that's like a separate issue that we as a society have to deal with but you can't just pretend that the inequality is not being is not just the result of like it's just a completely different way of doing business it's like and so these are obviously poundiers involved in like making non-technical people behave as if they're technical meaning their their actual value and the workplace goes up and they'll live better and they're less replaceable and that's one of the reasons we've been so adopted by industrials that have highly trained workers like auto manufacturers and others but in any case the the the the societal problem is that people implicitly have a deep belief in something that's no longer true which is that these things are linear and captured in price and so the the the political equivalent is that they're like these things are are less disruptive than they are the the business equivalent of it is people assume that one piece of software and the ability to implement it is going to be roughly the same so you can leave your structures the same but then you capture the value by paying lowering the price when in fact it's like if you bought if you installed the right software in COVID you saved thousands if not hundreds of thousands of lives and if you didn't you didn't and so it's like and that that that's just not the common sense and then the financial equivalent would be they think you can capture the value of the software purely by looking at the growth which is known as our growth and all these things are quite favorable but in fact that's just not that that just completely misses the beast it's like not actually how this works which is where like the technical people thinking about and hopefully joining our company and staying are much closer to actual the means of production than the people who are in charge of evaluating the means of production other countries that you know you're saying America is like leading on being adaptive and learning and listening to new crazy ideas are there any countries in the pandemic that have surprised you and how more adaptive or where your favorites what do you most excited about? We our product is used widely in the US the UK, Israel and a number of other countries that seem to have also been good at purchasing the vaccine and so it's what has surprised me is it seems highly the ability to purchase software and the ability to make other technical decisions seems it's not a question of causation but it does seem more correlated than I would have imagined much more correlated and it that really surprises me so that's why I'm even I think we should be even more passionate about teaching people not just so they buy a pound here but like one of the purposes of like it's like we must teach people who are not interacting with software how this works because it seems to be highly correlated to making other decisions that are quite frankly life and death decisions and even when they're not life and death it's like survival of your industry you know we we're powering industries that you know hire hundreds and hundreds of thousand people and independent of the ability to evaluate software products it seems again much more correlated than I would have imagined the ability to evaluate software and the ability to evaluate well what should I do under these decisions involving a technical product like like a vaccine and under what conditions do you purchase it and how you distribute it it seems to be borderline causation as if not it's certainly strong correlation and that's actually very much surprised me
