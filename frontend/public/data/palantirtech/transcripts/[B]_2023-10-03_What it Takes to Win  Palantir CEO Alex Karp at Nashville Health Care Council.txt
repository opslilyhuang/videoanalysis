TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right, welcome back. I hope you enjoyed your lunch. We have an action packed afternoon. It has been an incredible morning and an incredible two days really already. We're really excited to kick off the second half of day two, finance and innovation. And I know you're all very excited and ready to hear from some of our dynamic speakers this afternoon. So let's get started. I'd like to welcome to the stage David Dill, Chairman and CEO of Life Point and Health. Among David's many accolades and accomplishments, he serves on the board of the Federation of American Hospitals where he's a former chairman of the board. He's also a long time board member of the Nashville Healthcare Council. David played an instrumental role in cultivating not only Nashville's healthcare ecosystem, but truly rolled up his sleeves as a immediate past council board chair to make this event happen. Please join me in welcoming David Dill. Thank you. Thank you, April and thank you for joining us. I know there'll be a few more people that come in here in a few minutes. It's an honor to be here. This is a really special building. I've been in a concert in this room with one of the great entertainers of our generation, which was great. About a year ago, my daughter got married and the reception was upstairs in the glassed-in room on the top floor. For those of you that have not been up there, even if it's not a wedding going on, it's a great room, but when it's your daughter's wedding, it's a really, really great room with a lot of good memories. So it is great to be back here. And it's great to be with Alex Carp. Alex is the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. Many of you may have seen Alex speak before or on podcasts on other videos that get posted through other social media platforms. But this will be a really interesting discussion about a background that drove him into this business and a push into healthcare in a meaningful way. And since we're here to talk healthcare, we're going to lead off with healthcare. But we're going to do that after we learn a little bit more about Alex. So maybe Alex, if we could start for everybody, just give us a little bit of kind of your story, your childhood, what led you to this place. And I know you finished up with a PhD in philosophy in Frankfurt. And then ultimately we'll get into your business life. Well, I'm delighted to be here and delighted to be on stage with you. And I do, we might talk about this later, right? I do think the culture here, if you look at industries that America dominates music, entertainment, and tech, there are more similarities. But to my personal biography, one of the most important parts of American outperformance is the management of talent that doesn't really fit. And I don't know, you wouldn't even know where to start in my biography to say in which ways I don't fit. But there's a lot there. Can read about it. And so when we were looking at building this company, I wouldn't even know how to metabolize a playbook. It's a most tank is built. Not the great companies, but where you would make most of your money is you have a playbook, you have like a thin software product and thick sales, and you hire a CEO that's really good. Basically from Wall Street, but can pretend they're not. And you know, the engineers that are good, mostly leave, but that's how you're like replaying the same record. And I mean, there's a lot of my biography. I tend to over index on my severe dyslexia, which now I'm convinced at some point people will be teaching children how to be dyslexic so that you can succeed in business. But honestly, it's given the outperformance of dyslexics in business, but it was definitely not something I wished upon myself. And I come from an academic family where the one metric of success is basically not being dyslexic. And yeah, I don't know. It's kind of a scary thing. It kind of looks romantic now because I think people view that as a feature. But then when we, there's, we just made every decision incorrectly in building our business. And I'm not, I think we're at the infancy of our business, but you know, we're a multi-billion dollar revenue company with a sizeable market cap. People think we've done very well. And I think it's a lot because we've we harness on the inside the best town in the world. And I approach them quite frankly as dyslexics because they're, we have some people in the room. They're, these are truly unique individuals with very special needs. You know, and they actually do have special needs. It's like they have to work in an environment where people respect their technical prowess. I often say, in jazz, there was this thing, the blue note, which is a note I can't hear. I bet you're almost known in the room can hear. And very few people can play. And the people we manage at Palantir can either play or hear the blue note. And they need a specialized environment for to build the kind of things we build and to work with enterprises. And I have co-built and managed that environment. So I've read your bio as well. And I know you went to Stanford law. Best I could tell I searched every state database and I could not find that you passed the bar. I didn't take it. Oh, you didn't take you to take the test. It was never allowed. And then you pick up and move overseas shortly thereafter to study in Frankfurt. What really drove you into law school and then what drove you out of that and into your time over in Frankfurt? Well, my dad is a pediatrician for low income children. But he writes a lot about malnutrition and a bunch of other things. And so I saw this as if I go to law school maybe I can help out. I didn't know who I wanted to help out, but I figured someone needed help. And I hated every minute of it. So I don't know how many I'm going to help anyone out when I hate doing this. And I'm kind of driven by mission. So it's hard for me to be good at something I don't believe in. And then I believed in getting a PhD in German philosophy and then I realized that was a waste. And I worked with some of the best people in the world and arguably the best person in the world. I realized I didn't want to be him and I couldn't be him. And then I also realized there were a couple of skills I had that were like I wouldn't have recognized him at the time, but like or would you call building skills? Like it is a skill to be able to organize people to build something useful, especially when those people are very difficult and don't want to listen. We have a couple of the more difficult people here and doing phenomenal work. But and so you're looking your team members. I'm looking at my team. I couldn't see. No, no, no, no, we have my team members. They're here. This is a no, no, your team is not is pretty straightforward. Our team. Yeah. And so I then came back to America and then I reconnected with my co-founder who at the time was a moderately famous Peter. And one day he called me is like, and we had done some things together. And then he called me and was like, what do you want to co-found this company? And I I'm always giving this advice to younger people. You know, a lot of people I give them an offer and they're like, well, what's the pay? What's the health? What's the benefits? And like I just said, yes. It was like, well, and I started and then it turned out that part of my business is you have to manage the people on the inside and occasionally people have to pay you. And there was no one who was better at that than me at the company. I'm not saying there wasn't anyone better in the universe. But and I had some insights for our original product that turned out to be pretty valuable. That's still valuable now. And I don't know, I fell in love with I mean our mission and I really like the people. And that's why I'm doing it 20 years later. It's great. Well, I'll volunteer now over two decades old. Many of the companies that represent this room are you know, two decades old, maybe two weeks old and maybe 50 years old. So we're all in different phases, the evolution of our business models as well. And I do want to come back to the beginning of Palantir in a little bit because I do think it's an important part of the story. But I want to fast forward out of the last almost over 20 years, over two decades. The last three years have been just an enormous amount of change that we've all felt and lived through in this room. Some perhaps more acutely than others, but everybody was supporting each other and navigating the pandemic. But when I go back to the early part of 2020 and I think about the pandemic, and now I think about Palantir's push into healthcare, there's two or three things I'd like to maybe have you comment on one is the work that you did with the federal government as it related to the pandemic, because I think it ties into the core competency and the mission of of Palantir. There was a financing transaction where you took your company public in September of 2020. Now there are some bankers in the room, and I don't know where they are, but I was with a few of them last night. I'll be with a few more later on tonight. But you didn't do a traditional IPO. You did something completely different. So I want to come back and talk about that. And then I want to end up in the big push that you're making into healthcare and why the big push in healthcare over these last several years. So maybe let's start with the COVID response. And then we'll come back and talk about the offering. Well, I remember I was out actually cross-country skiing, which is my big hobby, and then I realized, wow, this is real. And then there's, and then mainly in the US, we, in every Western country, we had shortages. And so some of that was PPE, and then there was a distribution of the vaccine. But the core technical issue was not, the shortages, it was that these data sets are disparate, and they're the underlying logic of the data set is built so that you can't get a unified answer. Not by intention. And those of you are running larger, maybe slightly older companies will find that just like the federal governments all over the world, you're basically sewn together different companies where each company had a logic of viewing their business model, and they impose that on the data. And then it makes it very hard to optimize. And optimization is the name of the game when you have a crisis. And in optimizing where you have data protection, civil liberties constraints is a very difficult problem. And especially difficult where, you know, every minute counts. And so then the real problem was, well, how do we get, and we were very successful in getting the US and the UK to adopt this product we had built. Now we had built this product foundry obviously not with healthcare in mind. We had built it because we believed that the underlying technical integration issues of large enterprises were actually deeper than the enterprises themselves realized, especially if there's a regulatory or security overlay. So we worked for a number of years on this with some of the best engineers in the world. And it was not popular internally or externally to invest this much time on it. But we ended up with exactly the right product. What we would, what bankers would call product market fit, what I would call, like for tourists, the real problem was political. So, you know, there's always these memes that, because like Peter, who was, you know, conservative, was actually hard because, you know, they didn't want to have any appearance of conflict of interest. So the White House was like, well, we can take your calls on Tuesday at 2.30 with 15 witnesses and it was really hard. And then somehow we got to content providers who knew the technical challenge. And that was the breakthrough because the technical, in America and the UK, for all the things we could do better, without picking on other countries, the mortality rates in some large European countries were much higher than they had to be because they called their buddies. And their buddies don't have the right product. And in this country and the United Kingdom, the technical people, and I would say an unsung hero in COVID, I mean, you know, because we're so Balkanized politically, if it happened under Trump, no one could have happened, you know, like no one would submit the other side did anything right. But the Army Corps of Engineers saved more lives than any other, I mean, those guys, you know, some people in my company, you might imagine, are slightly arrogant. And we were not so much you guys, but my, you know, so I, I was really worried we wouldn't have a counterparty that would be able to help us install the product. These are the largest data sets in the world. They're disparate. Potentially millions of lives are at stake. It's going to go in our product. And I called somebody a pound who's crazy talented, but, you know, thinks everyone else is less talented. And I was like, well, how good are the people? He's like, no, no, they're very good. And that's when I knew we were going to have a huge impact. And I really think it's a tragedy, those Army Corps of Engineers, maybe it's better for us, they kind of disappeared into the woodwork, but they are really big unsung heroes and probably changed the mortality rates in this country by 50 percent, if I had to guess. I mean, obviously they're probably another's. And that's how we ended up being the software infrastructure for the distribution here, UK, I think 17 other countries. So talk to us and we'll come back to the public offering. Talk just a little bit about the push into healthcare. And I'll share a little bit of my experience early on with Palantir. So I'd love to hear, you know, you learn, you have a core competency. You've been in business for 20 years. You know, COVID hits, I've heard you say, it's not how well you plan. It's how you, well, you react to things that you don't can't plan for. And so that hits, it may even strengthen your core competency or the conviction around the core competency. And now a big push into healthcare in a meaningful way. And probably one of the reasons why you're sitting here today, I know you're working with Cleveland Clinic, you're working with Tampa General, you're working with HCA in a meaningful way here. And we're beginning to do some work together. And that's just kind of scratching the surface of what the potential is. Yeah. Well, yeah, no, a year ago, at least the stats we had, it was roughly 1% of healthcare in the US was somehow using Palantir now at 16%. So I am very, so obviously look, there's a new more more reasons to care about healthcare. And I don't have to lecture anyone in this room. But we do very well at the convergence of mission deep technical challenges and operators, or in this case, doctors, nurses, health providers who have are technically specialized. Because also you can't just tell those people to use the product, you're going to have to convince them, whether it's, you know, an analyst in a specialized analyst in a bank or at oil and gas company or in the government or a doctor. So it's like, end user is trained and has opinions, which has huge advantages. But as you, as, you know, what that also means they're going to say, no, like, and you can't just say use this technology. What's your, what's your recourse or will fire you? They're like, laugh at you. It's like, right, you're not firing me. I'm going back to my job, smuck. And so, and then you have very, very deep technical challenges. And this is where the playbook methodology that some bankers love, totally over a medium to long time horizon really doesn't work because the challenges you're having to meet purely technically would require a team hundreds of millions of dollars. So we're aligned with you because you don't have the time, patience or margins for that. And the costs are too high. Human costs, humanitarian costs of lives. The people I've met who are running these companies, I would say especially the ones we're working with, but not like, I don't know all of them are technical experts. So we, technical experts both know what they know. They also know what they don't know. So we bond well with culturally. And then it's an environment where you really can show results. So we struggle, we have like basically no clients in Hollywood. But how can you show a Hollywood executive something that is like the mathematical delta between how their movie would have been made with or without software. Maybe there isn't any, but it would be hard to show them that. That's not what they do for a living. It is you're going to appreciate that. And then obviously anything that can, you know, raise the quality of your product, the happiness of your end users, and make your margins better. And then, you know, we do like industry where, you know, it's like our political elite probably should be looking for ways to make your industry it easier, but that's not going to happen. So like realistically, you know, it's not my area, but I would be skeptical. And so you're going to really want to partner with, you know, and then, and so that looks like a really strong sweet spot. And then on our end, we, we got, we have a very strong team like, you know, I was in the office over the weekend, a couple of weekends ago, and like a weird hour. And, you know, the people in the office, a large percentage of them were working on these use cases. Now, I think it's partly because the two guys over there have done a great job of recruiting inside Pound Chair, but it's also, you have a very compelling, like we're not, we're helping you to improve human lives. And we like that. And that's, and I think when people interact with us, whether it's in healthcare or defense, people sense, we actually do care. It doesn't mean we're not commercial actors, of course we are. But, you know, it's been at this for 20 years. And, in cases, we have, we do have purely commercial clients, but I would say in this area, broadly speaking, and in defense, we really aren't making a lot of compromises. We're a very mission-driven company as well. And I've been excited about some of the products that we're building together, by taking, you know, highly fragmented information, sitting in different silos and bringing it together in a meaningful way that can impact decisions on the front line. It's not for myself to have or for our senior leaders that live here in Nashville to have, although it's nice information. It's really intended for that caregiver that's closest to the patient to impact life. And we have hospitals and care settings in some smaller communities around the country. And you know, I've visited on this before. It's important to me that we bring world-class technology and partners into our communities. So our communities aren't saying, you know, we finally got a Starbucks. We're the last one to get a Starbucks. We're bringing state-of-the-art new technology to help impact care and improve life. So we're directly along with you on the mission. And I'll tell you another way we're aligned that's counterintuitive. So, you know, for reasons that don't always make sense, I have millions and millions of people that follow me in Pound Chair. And a lot of them are being served by you. And those, these followers of Pound Chair, they invest in us. They run around the country saying, well, you're not using Pound Chair. Are you crazy? We have one big partner and the person there, this is not a technically, the person has just done everything for us on the other end. And I was randomly in the office of the late at night and we were doing like, you know, a call and the person showed up and I'm like, why are you working on the Pound Chair stack at like 9.30 on Friday evening? And the person's like, you're fighting for my freedoms. I'm going to fight to make sure my company uses your product. So I really care about these people. I cared about them before they helped out Pound Chair. And so like, I think, okay, great. You know, I help you. You'll help them. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. Let's pivot real quick for maybe a couple of minutes on the offering that you did in September 2020. And as I said, you have some bankers in the room. You did something probably in totally keeping with Palantir, the interesting company that's always looking at it from a different angle. But you decided alongside maybe a couple of other high profile names to instead of using and going through an IPO that we always talk about in this city with various companies, but a direct public offering. What led you to that answer? And why do you think that was the best solution for you in your shareholders? I don't think you heard me there for a second. Yeah, I know. There's just a lot there. And I don't, you know, it's like, look, I don't want to open the bloody wounds of my bad relationship with bankers. It's like, and, you know, look, in the end of the day, there are real reasons to the IPO will align you with bankers because they control the offering and whatever. It's your job. It's your job to provide health care. And I actually partner, we have some very big bank partners and there's some people in banking I revere. But, you know, obviously your job, the IPO helps you make money for you and your partners. If you, what was very healthy for us in the DPO is although we probably pissed off all the analysts and I still fight with them because it was yet another data point that I'm not going to play by their rules. It fully aligned us with our core retail investors. So if you look at most people who IPO during the time, their shares are very far underwater. And the people who were in the IPO made money and, you know, it's no wonder that, you know, maybe retail investors and people investing their own money have a very different opinion of Palantir than they might have of a company that IPO. Now, if an entrepreneur asks me what you should do, I don't believe every entrepreneur should DPO or IPO, but it clearly was the right, it depends. And if you are closer to the norm, IPOing is probably the easier and better thing to do. You probably will make the average person a lot less money than what they expect to make. On the other hand, the bankers are very good at explaining to each other why you're a better company than you are. So it's, I think I'm being fairly fair here. I mean, I could go a lot further. I'm on my best behavior. It's, it's, it's time to cut him off. It's, believe me, I'm on my best behavior here. I'm trying to move forward. We're moving forward. Well, let's move forward. Let's go ahead and move forward. Let's go back. Well, we're going to move forward by moving backwards. You talked about 20 plus years ago, very special friend of yours called and, and ask you to co-found a company and you didn't ask too many questions. You didn't ask how much stock am I going to get? You said yes. And I appreciate the simplicity of that answer. But when you think about, you know, where the company started, just, just real quick about, you know, the beginnings of the company. And then I would, I would like to talk about the role that you're playing, the active role that you're playing in, whether it's global or federal national discussions around the use of artificial intelligence. And we know that you're doing a lot of work around the, around the world in different countries. But just really the starting of Palantir, why it started and then how you're using that as a platform to help shape the narrative and the discussion around AI, both at a federal level and in a national level. Global level. Yeah. Well, the, look, it was, it was a very hard beginning because at the time, this was our other misalignment. I basically, we got kicked out of every VC in Silicon Valley with the comment that, well, why would anyone believe in building a company around data? Why would anyone work with the US government? You're saying this will take years to build. And we're financing, you know, the cockroach trap.com, which is going to make billions of dollars. And the person running it is less difficult than you. So it was, it was a hard beginning. And, uh, and actually, a number of the people running the company were, well, like, part of the reason I was thinking, well, when the money runs out, he's going to keep working. I promoted all those people. And, uh, and so, uh, and there's many of them are still running the company. And, uh, um, it, there, there was a deep focus, like from the beginning on, you can't really, if you're, if you're dealing with large systems and, and around the world, you, you can't actually solve the final mile without going very deep into the first 10,000 miles of tech issues. And you have to show up with a product that will allow you to quote unquote leap frog everything, which in some cases means it will work, as opposed to everything else. And you also need, you need macro conditions where it's painful enough that people are willing to change. And you need, we really need both deep relevant technology and macro, uh, favorable macro conditions. Um, and then a lot of the things, so that the first rock we built was for basically finding terrorists, but finding terrorists, uh, where you, um, you protect data or protect civil liberties. And some of those core architectural issues that are now in foundry, the product that we sell to commercial enterprises are absolutely crucial to powering, uh, managing, teaching algorithms. Um, and so, uh, it's not the same product. You have to build different products, but like, um, for example, with large language models, uh, you have a similar issue, like who's going to teach the large language model? How are you going to teach the large language, optimize it without teaching it your secrets or outsourcing for prior to data? How do you do this while verifying that you're not involved in illegal or unethical behavior? How do you do it while having a governance structure that allows you to see, to do a human verification if these are the decisions you believe in? Um, how do you, uh, decide what parts of your business can be, um, influenced or run by imprecise logic? Um, what, so like, for example, there's a part of your business where you're recruiting people. Well, maybe, you know, since you're interviewing anyway, that it would be better to, it's the thresholding of getting down to 10 people is more important than being exactly right. But then there are parts of your business where you're deciding where to put the scalpel that has to be 1,000% right. And so, um, the, and then there are regulatory and moral issues, do you, the person, or robot, or whatever, using the scout, who controls that? Where is the human in the loop? How did you know that the human was a, what algorithms are, are those algorithms, algorithms, what is the data set they had? All these issues that, and quite frankly, people are now discovering because the addressable market is so large. You know, we've been engaged in for 20 years and in a serious way, an AI for five years. And the real AI revolution actually began on the battlefield and the results of which have been seen in, in, in, in, in, in Ukraine, in the sense that a smaller power is done much better than anyone would have expected. The, the, where I'm spending a lot of time personally and something that, you know, you might want to help out with is about 0.2% of the DOD budget, 0.2% goes to AI. 0.2% that 0.2% is going to play a critical role. Needs to play a critical role in scaring our adversaries. We may not agree with it, but if you do agree with it, with the fact that we should scare our adversaries to create peace, we, we have to really look very closely on what we're spending and, and who gets the money. Thank you for sharing that. I assume the 0.2% needs to be more than 0.2% for us to tackle the challenges of the future. And any investment in anything, it comes down to who is, who gets the money. Like, whether that's, yeah, anything. And that's something we as a country have to think a lot about. That's great. Thank you, thank you for sharing that. We have a few more minutes left. I wanted to just get into a couple of things. One of the things you talk about is, you know, identifying problems before they even exist and maybe even developing products five years before they're even needed. So your ability to look around a corner is something that I think is very unique and interesting for all of us. And I want to come back to that at the very end of this discussion. One of the things that really, you're a great interviewer. If I could only be half as good as you. Oh, come on. It's, yeah, it's great. You give like a warning of where it's going. And then I could think about it. I heard you're slow on your feet. It's, it's, it's, it's. Your staff did a good job prepping me. It's a really good. No, one of the things I've enjoyed about getting to know you is, you know, how you identify talent. We are all challenged with workforce and workforce challenges. And you built a big company spread out throughout the world. You're interviewing highly technical, capable people, doing in many cases super classified type work. And you've got to be right very often. One of the things that, that I learned from you is just how you tend to interview people and how quick you interview people. And I think it'd be something fun for you to share with the group on your style when something comes across your desk and we're ready to hire somebody. How much time do you spend in that interview? And what can you glean in a short amount of time? Yeah, one of the things I'm really, I think I'm, I think I've done it honestly. There's a lot of things I've done. I wish I had done a better job on. But the one thing I think I'm reasonably certain I did a great job on was being involved in the hiring of the first three, I mean, at least the first 130, you could call it the first 500, 600 people I hired personally. And then made sure and really was heavily involved in who runs what and who's on what deployment as we called it at the time. And so this was a little bit legendary in the Valley because the venture people were like, this company is crazy, it's stealing town from our consumer internet companies that are making our societies less safe, less fun, and more divided. And but making us wealthy. And that's, I mean, they hated me. They probably still do. But I'm also a little proud of that. But the, and it's counterintuitive. But what I was very good at was not, the standard way people interview as a long interview with all sorts of questions, I found that my reaction to people in the first couple minutes was most accurate. And now part of it was I tend to believe most of the great town in America is not at Thuleat School so that we have hired disproportionately from elite schools. And one of the things you learn at elite school was how to answer questions correctly. But that's very different than how to do your work correctly. And so I'm testing for someone's going to be valuable in five years and 10 years. Not somebody, I went to Stanford. Someone has the skills to get you into Stanford. And so that, by having a shorter interview, you, first of all, you make the playing field more level. And also, you won't let people get into their sales mood. And often, if you ask a question, they're not expecting you to ask. You just get a jarringly on a sancer. In some cases, the answer will be, some of my engineers just look at me like the answer was, I can't answer. But then, like, OK, well, that's an interesting answer, too. And but the intuition around who to hire, those hires, built our products. And have really have changed the history of America. That's interesting. Thank you, Vashina. Rapid fire real quick here. What do you do for fun? What does Alex go do for fun? Cross-country skiing, Tai Chi, and distance shooting. Is that where you do your thinking? Or is that just where you kind of clear your brain and focus on those activities, the free up space for you to dream? Yeah, I like being alone. So those activities are alone doing. And then I feel very much less shackled. And I often come up with not always, but I come up with not usually while I'm doing the activities. But so if I go, if I'm cross-country, or doing something, then afterwards, usually, they're not always profound thoughts, but it might be, oh, this isn't going to work. This person needs to be moved. And sometimes they are profound. That's how I came up with the DPO. We had told people for 17 years at the time we wouldn't IPO. And then I was in New Hampshire. I had gone for one of these interval runs. I came home and like, oh, that's stupid. We need to change this. And then I called, typically, if you're doing an IPO or DPO, people prepare, they start the company and start prepping for this. We literally had no preparation. And I remember calling our CFO at the time. I'm like, OK, sit down. We have eight weeks. We're going to do this. It's like eight weeks. This has never been done. And then we got to go. That sounds like the owner of our company. Yeah. It took us a little longer than eight weeks. But the accounts tell us it'll take eight months. I'm like, well, I don't know. We got to get that calendar. Yeah. That's great. So bring us home here. And we'll conclude on this. Help us look around the corner with you for just a few seconds. In 10 years, and I know that's just the beginning of the company. You'll be three decades in for something that you're building to last much longer than that. But 10 years from now, what does Palantir look like? Well, I think we will power along with others. Rejuvenation of Western defense efforts. We will build products that make people in the West. But particularly America, mainly because America is so much more receptive to technology, which is really a problem for the rest of our allies. They're just not adapting as fast as we are. And I'm worried that they're going to get left behind. And then, so that's the positive side. And I hope we play a role in making sure the dangers of AI are ameliorated. And that there's kind of positive transparency so that people know they're being treated fairly. You have more buy-in for general society. So we look forward to seeing the journey. And thank you so much for everything that you're doing to change health care, but to also make the world a safer place. There's a lot of things that we don't see that you're doing, but we know that there's things being powered behind the scene. So thank you for doing that. We look forward to seeing the success. Another round of applause for co-founder and CEO, Alex Scarf. Thank you for being here. Thank you.
