Thank you. It's great to be here today. I'm very excited to share with you the analytics vision at Tampa General, the challenges we're facing, and also review some use cases of where we've used foundry to solve really difficult problems. To start, I'd like to give a little bit of background about TGH and how we serve the community. So Tampa General Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in Florida. We're the only level one trauma center in the Tampa Bay region. We're nationally ranked among the top 50 hospitals and seven specialties, and we're ranked in the top 10% of all hospitals nationally. We've been ranked number one in the Tampa Bay area for as long as I can remember. We are one of the top organ transplant centers in the nation, and we are the primary teaching school for the University of South Florida's Morseony College of Medicine. So annually, we train over 700 residents in numerous specialties, and we're helping develop the next generation of physicians. While we started in Tampa Bay, we've now expanded throughout Central and South Florida, we have now over 100 locations. So this map shows all of the entities in our downtown Tampa location, and with our partners, we're building a medical and research district. So within this district, we're providing a continuum of care for our community and investing in research to improve healthcare nationally. So when we took a look at our analytics program, we realized we're supporting an ever-growing organization, and we realized we had to modernize. And there were several problems that you can see listed that we had. But one of the biggest problems that we had was really access to data. So while we had a few curated data sets that we could use across solutions, most of our solutions that we built had an underlying data layer with them, that accompanied them. So as more, we built more and more solutions, we built more and more data sets, and we round up with duplicate data, data sprawl, extra maintenance. So all of the problems that go with that. So the image on the screen is our interfaces diagram. So we currently have over 100 systems connected, and we pass over 12 million messages between those systems daily. So we're data rich from an operational perspective. However, since all of this data is siloed, we're information poor. So that, and this is what we realized when we were looking for a solution to help us build and modernize the program. So one of the things we needed for our program was we realized it really wasn't a direction for the organization. And there was no vision, there's no strategy, a lot of things were just ad hoc requests. We're coming in from all over the organization, first come, first serve type of thing. So this is our vision that we created. Data infused everywhere to create the connected health system. And our strategy, and at the center of that strategy, is foundry. So here are the reasons that we chose foundry. For one, it's very simple to ingest large amounts of data rapidly. And the other thing is, there are tools within foundry so that you can create visualizations. You can provide those insights. You can bring in your AI libraries. All of those things that help provide information. And I like to call these analytic applications. But insights are great, but I think we've heard throughout today that without action, it's really not valuable. So these analytic applications allow folks to interact with the data, update the data, and then actually write those changes back to those source systems. And that to me is a real differentiator for foundry. So the first use case that I would like to go over is our clinical staffing model. And we primarily focused on nursing. So the problem that we had was, this is a very manual process. So our nurse managers, what they would do before, a couple hours before every shift, they would print out their schedules, they would get together and meet, and then they would review staffing and try to shift staffing across the units to optimize, optimize the staffing for every unit. So they did the best they could. And they came to us and said, can you help us? Can you at least take away this paper process for us? So we said absolutely we can. So what we did was we started bringing in data into foundry. So we brought in the nurse schedules. We brought in the patient census for each unit. We also then brought in the QD levels for the patients. And with that, then we automatically calculated the optimal staffing ratios with the free unit. So then, so we were very happy with that. And then they said, you know, what would be great is, you know, sometimes we don't know which nurses can go to which units. So we provided that information as well so that we have all of the credentialed information for the nurses. And then we also added in a recommender engine in there so that we could actually show which for the logical moves to make for moving staff between departments. So we were still stuck within the kind of the day of mindset, right? So they came and said, you know, what would be even better would be as if we could predict a few days out. And then we could even shift staff between days. That would be extremely helpful. So we went back to work. We put our predictive model. And then we also said, you know, we needed a way to actually contact these folks a little bit better. So they were just reaching out text, sometimes Facebook, all those things to try to message and communicate with their staff. So we built in a texting model that would send out to the nurses that they chose to send to for requests for for shift changes, for overtime and all those and so on. So the results of this were a couple of things. First off, we saw some cost savings, some reductions from our agency nursing. So that was really good. And then we saw the balancing of the staff across the units, really, we're excellent. So we did a comparison between the units that we'd rolled out on this program and the ones that were still on the on the old paper-based system. And what we found was there was a 30% increase of improvement of nurse staffing ratios for those units that were on the system. And what that really translates to better staffing ratios is better patient care. So the next use case that I'd like to go over is it's an expansion of our nursing model. It's not necessarily what we did, but it was really the circumstances around that. So this request came in on a Friday afternoon, it was late September, and this is what the hospital was facing. It was about five or six days out from Hurricane Inn, hitting Florida, and at that point, the location of landfall was actually Tampa. So to give you a little bit of context around the hospital and the severity of the issue is the main hospital is located on an island in Tampa Bay. And while it has great water views of downtown, it's not a prime location for where you want to have a hospital in that zone. And it's also in the middle of the main evacuation zone for Tampa. So some of the things that we do is we build a temporary sea wall. And that sea wall surrounds the entire hospital. So the request for us was, can you do for physicians what you did for the nurse staffing model? You know, by the way, we need this by Monday morning, so we have actually time to do this. So the team immediately went to work. We located the data sets that we needed to pull in. We started bringing that data into Foundry and connecting it to the existing data sets that we had there. And then we also built an application to help manage that. So what we were able to do was we built this model in 24 hours. A complete delivered application that we're able to balance and make sure that we have the right specialties across the units and during the time of the storm. So the final use case I'd like to go over is what we call our PACU throughput project. And the PACU is really a recovery unit. So after your surgery, you go to one of these units and make sure that you're stabilized before they transfer you to your hospital unit. So in hospital units are specialized. So think of it as a heart patient, we'll go to a cardiac unit and so on. So they ask us like, hey, can you help us? We're having issues with bed planning, having issues with our recovery units, getting full. That's causing throughput problems in the surgery center. So we took a look at this. So they were again, very manual process. They were printing out the surgery schedules, trying to figure out staffing for each of those units and trying to figure out and predict the beds the morning of every morning. So we brought in all of the surgical schedules. We brought in the staffing models that we had as well. And what we realized is we could see which surgeries were going to be performed. So we could then predict when every patient was going to arrive in the recovery unit and how long they were going to stay there. So that allowed us then to flex staff across up and down as needed. So that was a big gain for us. Again, we were still kind of operating on that day of type of situation. So they said, you know what? If you could you predict a few days out, this would really help bed planning and discharge planning. So we created bottles and brought it into the system. And now we're projecting and they're working on bed planning and discharge planning days in advance. And this has been a big game changer. So the impact of this is what we've seen is we've seen a 28% reduction of hold time within these units. So the patients are moving into the units that they need to for care faster. And we've also reduced the time that a nurse managers are spent managing this process by over 83%. So our predictive model, the accuracy is running right now. I think the last meeting we had was around 94%. So very solid and a lot of a lot of good things from this. So what's next for us? What's next for TGH and for Foundry? So some of the things that we're doing is we're adding on to the existing use cases. So our staffing model, we're taking that to our environmental services team to help them manage their staffing better. For our throughput model, we're taking that to our operating rooms to help them manage their throughput better. We're also working on a predictive subsis model and care pathways around treating subsis for those individual patients as optimally as possible. So for all of these things what we're doing is we're continuing to ingest this data, right? We're moving into Foundry and building this connected health system. If you see at the bottom, this is addressing several of the key concerns that we had. One of those being data quality because we have now a single source of truth, removing duplication of data, also speed to market. So as we're bringing more and more data in and the team is becoming more familiar with the organization and the tool, our time to market now is reduced drastically. So keys to success. So a few things that you'll need to be successful with the implement a program. First off, you need senior leadership alignment. Our CEO is bought into this. He asked us about what we're doing with Palantir every week. We have a steering committee made up of senior executives that help us with governance and drive which projects are we going to be using. Operational engagement. You need your subject matter experts. You won't be successful without them. The nice thing that we've been able to see is that with the success of the applications that we've built is that now they're becoming advocates for us in the organization. So they're telling the story for us instead of IT, always bringing like, hey, we can help you. They're being that advocate. You need to support your analytics team. We're doing that with training and giving them time to be proficient with foundry because this was a big change for them. You need a mature integration team and that's really key because you're going to be pulling a ton of data in and a lot of it is real time for it to be useful. And then you need to have everybody working together just aligned with a roadmap for your future. And with that, we feel we can make our goal of rapid transformation at scale a reality. So this is a picture here of a lot of our analytics team, some of the Palantir team at a recent training event that we had on site in our analytics hub. And I said, we're not just investing in foundry and software and investing in the team. So we're adding, we're looking to add analysts, developers, engineers, team members that are seeking people that are seeking a challenge, a meaningful challenge. In conclusion, I'd like to leave you with a couple of things. First off, foundry is great software. But even better than that, the people that Palantir brings to help you implement that software is even better. And that's why we partner with Palantir. Thank you.
