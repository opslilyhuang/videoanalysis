TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Concordants want to fix the fragmented healthcare supply chain. If you think about a nurse or a doctor, bedside needing a product, and if they have to leave the patient's side to go search for that, that is time not spent providing patient care. But a mentally suppliers, distributors and caregivers do not function in isolation. They're part of a complex web of people and products that make life-saving care possible. Today, the care system faces daily shortages of staff, chronic conditions continue to rise. When it comes to supply chain disruption, hospitals and patients will always be the hardest hit. The technology needed to solve these challenges needs to embrace that complexity. That's where we're using foundry. Concordants wants to reinvent the distribution landscape and what is expected of a healthcare distributor. We're using Palantir Foundry to build a digital healthcare ecosystem that can meet the unique and complex needs of an ever-changing healthcare industry. Our suppliers have always had visibility into what they are sending to distributors. The what happens to that product once it's received, they're much less aware of. They may have products sitting in 200, 500, a thousand different locations. If we can connect those two pieces of data, we can make better informed decisions so that the patient isn't affected so that the healthcare worker does have product to take care of them. The reason why we're reactive is because we don't have visibility. The lack of visibility also breeds a lack of trust. The ecosystem disrupts all of that. We can provide real-time data so that people can make actionable decisions. We're not waiting 30, 60, 90 days for that information to travel up and down the stream. Once we really understood the power of foundry, we quickly realized that this could be the solution for the entire industry. We can assign a level of urgency to different critical back orders so they know which of these need to be fulfilled as a highest priority. We can make sure we have verified entrusted sources in the platform, but also the right people have secure managed access to them at the right time and for the right purposes. Our ultimate goal is to build and scale that capability to find solutions within the supply chain before they are disruptions. There's no way we would have been able to build an ecosystem like this ourselves from the ground up. With foundry, we're using the platform to build with it. We can tailor an existing proven product to our own vision for this integrated healthcare supply chain. As we continue to build and enter these bring ideas into the ecosystem, we expect that value to grow monumentally as we look into the future. This is more than just about creating a seamless and efficient process. It's about taking reactive decisions that are made today throughout the entire supply chain, and turning them into proactive solutions. That has very real world implications when we think about the individual patients that these products are used for.
