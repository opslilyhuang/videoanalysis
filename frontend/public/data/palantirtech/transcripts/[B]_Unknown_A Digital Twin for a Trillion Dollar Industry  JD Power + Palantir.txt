TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

That is a really, really tough act to follow. So I have three things against me. One, I'm an engineer. And my guess that engineers are way less eloquent than ambassadors. English is my second language. And I'm going to talk to you not about security, national security, or healthcare. I'm going to talk to you about cars. We just spend most of my time doing. So I work in JD Power. JD Power started about 50 years ago. And the way they started back then is they did surveys and ask people what they thought about their car. And they took that information and helped OEMs kind of want to factor us to build better cars. Fast forward, now we are fundamentally a data analytics company. We collect a lot of data. I'll show you a little bit about that in a second. And we work with OEMs trying to basically, in each of them, build better cars, sell more cars, et cetera, et cetera. So I wanted to put you in the minds of an OEM, of an employee of OEM. If any of you work in an OEM, you will wake up January 1st. And this is what you see ahead of you. 15 million cars are going to be sold this year. Each of those cars, the average price is about $45 to $47,000. They become very expensive. You add repairs and service, et cetera. You come up with a figure that is a little bit south of $1 trillion because we're in the pandemic, coming out of the pandemic. But you know, in a year or so, the industry will be clearly above $3 trillion again. Right? So if you look at that, there's a lot of battles to be fought ahead of you, correct? A trillion dollars in revenues to be there you can go after. I took a look a couple of days ago on how does this battle starts? We see that Toyota has the biggest market share, 12.5% of the market, 4.11.2. That was the start of the year. So when they step the first time at work, this is what it looks like. Obviously, the fight is not far at this level, or this is a very high level, but at the smaller levels of geography, et cetera, et cetera. You have to look at things like segments, sedans, luxury sedans. So you have competitors and categories between them, SUVs, largest SUVs, smaller SUVs, luxury SUVs, et cetera, et cetera. In each of those areas, there's a lot of variables that come to understand what's going on in the market, and what you can do to go on try to increase your market share and so on in margin. Let's look at one particular segment in the industry. This is a 4.150. Anybody here has a 4.150? Not many, maybe, two or three? Cool. This is the most sole vehicle in the US for tens of years in a row. There are two factories that make this car. One is in the Airborne Michigan. You're the one in Kansas City. In each of those factories, every 51.5 seconds, there's a truck that comes out of it. When it comes out of it, it's scan, and at that instant, that truck belongs to the dealer. So every 25 seconds or so, there is a 4.150, common in those factories, correct? And obviously, they go to places. They go to dealers, to geographies, et cetera, et cetera. So if you look at what is the market share and the fight in that segment, here's the way it looked like last week. 27.3% of the market is 4. Basically, they have 150s. They've been leading that industry for a long time. Chevy Silverado, 18.7, et cetera, et cetera. So if you're one of those brands, correct? You are looking at your competitors and you're seeing, okay, in this particular segment, in this particular region, how can I do better? So I'll talk a little bit about what are the constraints and what are the variables that you can move in and out. This is a view of Silverado versus F-150 in Denver. And I'll tell you a little bit about all these metrics. The first one, CFTP is customer-facing transaction price. This is the price at which these vehicles are sold. Look at the numbers. Pretty good. Pretty high. The next one is the number of days that a car stays in the lot, correct? So you want that car to move fast. High days in the lot is bad. Incentive spending, all OEMs, to try to move their cars faster, they need to put money on the hood. They need to say, hey, here's another whatever, $1,000 rebate so you can get that car out. Imagine you're a factory in an OEM producing every 51.5 seconds a car, you want them to be sold, otherwise you're going to get a huge backlog of cars somewhere in the country. Inventory, how many cars do I have in the lot? Retail sales, how many I'm selling, and total gross per unit, what is my margin basically? So all of our, these are just whatever, six variables that are kind of important when you sell a car. And then I'm comparing, in this case, Silverado and F-150, if I'm 50 person, which is the blue one, correct? The case to turn is actually higher, so I'm not very happy to see that. Inventory is high, I have a lot of inventory. Incentive spending, my competitor is spending more money than I am. So is it, my car is staying longer in the lot because somebody is spending more money in the senses than me, et cetera, et cetera? Those are the key questions that some of them ask. Let's look at a couple of things that, in my opinion, are two important entry, two important variables that you can change in order to sell your car faster and a higher margin. Inventory, an incentive spending. So when you think about inventory, you could say, hey, let's think about Southern Colorado, correct? My inventory is dropping, I just send more cars, how many? 10,000, 50,000, et cetera, et cetera. We wish the problem was that simple. Because in inventory, you have to really specify what cars, what things are inside the car, what is the configuration of the car? So if you go to an OEM website, your favorite car, F150, whatever you like, and there's a button that says build. So when you hit that button, you start, awesome, the paint outside. You change the paint because you love this paint. Then you go to interior and the wheels and maybe a toll in package and maybe a luxury package and maybe, you know, stereo, very nice stereo, et cetera, et cetera. So all those things are the things that define how our car. The OEM has to decide what are those things to build, way in advance. And the dealer has to decide which ones I'm going to order to put in my lot. Here's a challenge. For the Silverado, there are 42,000, more than 42,000 ways in which it can be a car. And for the F150, 67,000 ways, correct? So I have to make a decision at the OEM and the dealer which ones are ordered. And sometimes what happens is that I as a customer went to a website, built this beautiful car that I end up loving at printed page and put in from my desk. But then the probability that I find that car is way less than 1%. Way less than 1%. So you go to the dealer and you say, awesome, this is the car I want, correct? But the dealer would say, we have the toll in package, but we only had red ones left. And you say, I don't like red ones. I really don't like red ones. The other competitor has a toll in package and has a black one which I really like. I'm going to go for that one. So I switched brand not because I like one specifically more is stronger, but I got the car that I wanted. So why is this bad? In the US, and I'm going back to 2020 because right now we call it a inventory, but the industry will go back to this for sure. In 2020, the average time that it took to sell a car once it got into the dealer lot was 65 days. The average time that it took to sell a house in the US was 25 days. So it's way faster, almost 310 faster, to sell a house than to sell a car. It's incredible. And our calculations are at this in that time, about $150 billion of asset value was sitting in the parking lots of the dealer waiting to be solved. So that's inventory, correct? I need to decide what cars to send to Denver so I can increase my cell velocity and keep my margins. That's one variable, second variable incentives. Awesome. The industry spent, is going to spend this year $25 billion in incentives. $25 billion to give customers so they can try to sell the car faster. Two years ago when incentives were higher, that figure was above $60 billion. So in a year or two, most probably, we're going to spend $60 billion in incentive. Again, is that an easy problem to solve? I could say, hey, we are, we're losing a little market share, they're putting another $50 million in this truck. But the situation is a little more complicated because the industry has defined a lot of incentive types. So should I put an incentive that is just cash by this car and get $2,000 below a cell price, for example? Or for example, an incentive on the interest rate. There's lower interest rate on this vehicle. So I need to decide what type of incentive I need to decide what is the value to which geographies is going to apply and to which models is going to apply. So the complexity of this and other areas in the auto industries is extremely high. As a consequence, the industry has typically worked in a very thick brushes, like, hey, this is going to incentive for the whole country. Or let's produce these types of trucks just by, it's incredible, sometimes by God-feeling. Yeah, I think that we're, you know, so many reds, so many blacks, so many luxury, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a very tough problem. We as a company have acquired a lot of datasets, I'll show you in a second. But our goal is to, the way we're looking at this is, can we build a digital trend for the whole industry? Can we build, do we have enough data on our hands that we can replicate the state of the industry in the most reliable way? This is the data that we have. This is our starting point. We have, over the last 50 years, created a bunch of datasets. We now are part of the Toma Bravo as a PE company that allows us to buy about nine companies in the last three years. And we buy companies when the economics work. We buy companies because we have, they have datasets that we think are important. And datasets that, with ours, can increase the way we understand the industry. Because they start mixing and matching together. So we have inventory data. We know every car that is sitting in the oil and in all the data, lots in the US. We know what is inside all this configurations that we talked about. For each VIN number, we know what's inside of them. We know the residual value. What is going to be the cost, the value of the car in three years. The incentives are available to apply to the car in the industry. We get sales transaction from dealers, basically from the point of sales systems of the dealers. We have 240 attributes of the sale, which includes price, the dealer margin, incentive applied, buy demographics. We got a repair data set that tracks repair events in the industry when they happen. All the attributes of those repairs, including warranties, etc. We know the value of a vehicle of every VIN in the US. We know exactly what is the value of the car given the configuration that it has on the time. Quality ratings, experience ratings because we talk to customers and loyalty when somebody switches brands. We think we have the ingredients to define, again, what is the state of the industry? I think that you have seen this before. This is an ontology that we're building. We're almost there. This is zero. That means that I'm out of time. I guess not. Okay, so this is an ontology that we're building. The beautiful thing about the ontology for those of you that have not tried is that you build this data representation of the object level. You can't forget about tables and merges, etc. You look at data as objects. For us, it's important because we have distributed product teams. We bring all those data sets that we talked about. We're now merging them into a global and corporate level ontology. I'll give you an example. In this dealer that we're talking about in Denver, you probably don't be able to read the details, but the bottom line here is that we're building like an alarm system where we tell the OEM, hey, there's a problem in Denver. The F-150 is dropping market share against the Silverado over the last couple of weeks. Correct? Awesome. Here's an alert. Pay attention to this. Out of all the data that you have, pay attention to this today, and we bring the data that will allow that person to understand the context of the problem and to do something about it. Because when they get it all early, they want to see how my track in the market share, how is my incentive compared to the incentive of my competitors? How is my configuration moving? Are they moving a lot of the toy package with the black color? Or what about me? What is my inventory? What does it look like? We bring in all the data necessary to look at that very specific granular problem and solve it. Finally, this is our view and our ambition. We think we have a pretty good shot of building a good representation on the industry, which is what happened yesterday. And we're building applications that are pretty much descriptive. I want you to understand what happened yesterday, and because there's so much data and so much happening across the US, we want to tell you exactly what I think, what we think, the system thinks you should focus on. That's number one. Then number two is to start bringing forecasting models, prediction models, so that we can tell what's going to happen tomorrow if you take certain actions. And for that, we need to put machine learning models and deploy models through the Foundry platform. So that at this micromomance, we can say, hey, you should order if you want to send cars to Denver. This is what you should send, by the way. That will not be enough. I will put an incentive of $59 down in order to gain 1% more market share. Thanks a lot.
