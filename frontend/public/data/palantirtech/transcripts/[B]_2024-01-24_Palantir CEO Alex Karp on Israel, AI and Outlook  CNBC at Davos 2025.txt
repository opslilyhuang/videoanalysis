TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Welcome back to Squawk Box. Yesterday right here in Davos I spoke to Palantir CEO Alex Carp and a wide ranging interview. I started out by asking him about his recent trip to Israel. The main reason I went is because we corporate leaders, especially corporate leaders who are running public-cage companies, need to stop just parading things we don't believe, when it's popular, and then being silent when it's a little more controversial. Well we have all these, we had a movement I think it's fading away, largely understood his wokeism, where people said quite frankly in public lots of things that no one believed they believed in private. Now with Israel most people and positions of authority realized that what happened on October 7th was one of the worst terror attacks the West has ever seen, arguably the worst act of terrorism, sexual barbarism, the world has seen in a hundred years. And it is incumbent on us to actually not only speak loudly in private but occasionally show what we mean in public. And so core to defending the West for me was not just me going to Israel I'm very well known there, our products are used there I'm proud of that, but bringing the whole board and saying look you know you can you can debate lots of things about Israel but the people who are attacking it are calling into question the very existence of a thoroughly democratic western country that is defending our rights and we cannot just speak loudly in private and one of the key issues that you find including here is you know they people want to talk about rebuilding trust the elite no one trusts the elite yes but how could you trust the elite if everything you're saying is a half truth at best. You ran a full page ad in the New York Times after the tragedy that we saw in Israel you were the only company that I saw do anything like that. What was the reaction to that from your fellow CEOs? Look there are a lot of people who are like you're beep beep crazy you're gonna get in a lot of trouble a lot people are gonna call up and yell at you and my reaction to them was is never again mean I never take the risk of my own career is like it was always hard in history to stand up against discrimination brutal acts per grums sexual violence it we are at the point where you have to stand up and you know the interesting thing is in private a lot of people agree with me their position is but you can't say it in public because you'll offend something someone and this is exactly wrong you can no longer live in a world where you are not saying something that will affect you only say things that will offend no one like if you're going to defend something you have to defend it but then what's your view about companies that were speaking out on lots of other social issues that I think you don't think that they believed in so the core the core reason why people who are basically decent wonderful people in America have basically no trust in the elite is everyone senses that they spoke out on things they actually don't believe on believe in and they said a precedent the precedent that they set was I'm going to speak out about moral causes okay now you have one of the a crucial moral cause like you can be against what I'm saying you could you could be against standing with Israel you can't say you don't have an opinion you're of an opinion on this you have fallen on your head and like and if there are people in corporate America you say look I never have an opinion my opinion is the shareholders I actually am sympathetic with them but if you spent the last five years lecturing us about all sorts of things that no one believes you believe in private you can't just wake up the next day and say oh I can't speak about this thing I believe or say I have no opinion and it is crazy ridiculous and it undermines the fabric of our democracy because no one believes it let me ask you about what's happening here in Davos because one of the conversations that we have not seen in large part is one about what's really happening on the ground in Israel a conversation about anti-semitism the same conversation that's happening at institutions all over the world but it doesn't seem to be here yet it seems so very limited Davos has an important function I live on a different planet like in the planet I live in climate is important fighting bigotry of all kind is important the most important issue of our time is war and peace and the absolute most important metaphor for that is what do you think about what happened in Israel and by the way anti-semitism as a kind of prejudice is always been the canary in the coal mine for your society isn't working your university isn't working you're not providing real growth to your population and because you're not explaining why it doesn't work you just go blame the Jews and so like any any enterprise that's about making the world a better place that doesn't deal with these issues is basically saying I'm not really engaging in the problem and this is not just a problem here it's a problem with all sorts of institutions from our higher education to fake discussions in corporate America to international conferences and like I don't know why it falls on me to say the obvious but this is obviously just shows you you're not talking about the real problem can you speak to your recruiting efforts and how you're changing them in terms of where you plan to recruit people from and how you think about what used to be the most prestigious schools in America look palantir in all modesty's been way ahead of the curb we test everyone you went to Harvard we test you you went to university of Colorado you went to community college we retest you in the 50s in America if you were Yale degree a Yale alum and you got retested be offended that the legitimacy of our institutions is so much weaker everybody's going to move to our methodology you have to retest until we reform our institutions I don't know what a grade is I know what our test is and we would we say reform our institutions what does that mean look across across democracy in the west we have a very folk a large focus on what we pay not what comes out in tech we have a lot of absolute myopic focus on what comes out not what goes in and like our institutions have to move from what did we spend to what did we get and that's very very scary because the outcomes are unfair and that's why I'm actually a card carrying still a card carrying progressive because we have to take care of the people who are not going to benefit from the AI revolution who are not going to participate who need remedial help but the reality of what the West needs to do in every institution is it does not matter what you spend it matters what you get and by the way if there's one lesson of software the single thing that America does better than any other country it's not input it's output can I ask you about the power and influence of America today I spoke to Tony Blinken Anthony Blinken Secretary of State yesterday and we talked about all of these different challenges whether it's Israel Ukraine China and the question is are these idiosyncratic challenges that emerged on their own or did they emerge because of a power vacuum and this is the critique of what's happening in the United States of the polarization politics of the United States and that the American influence isn't what it used to be let me give you a different rip on this it's very confusing to the outside world on the one hand we are at 84 percent of the top 50 tech companies in the world are American and in 10 years it's going to be more like 90 percent we are absolutely dominant part of the reason corporate America likes this kind of I tell you fake things and you believe it you become a product as they want to hide everyone who's winning is in the small group of people all those all in America so that's that that creates a huge problem with China because we are actually winning and they are not then we need a way of robustly defending ourselves rhetorically and militarily that is not jingoistic that is not xenophobic and we we those people who have a classic playbook don't really know how to do this they don't know how to say yes we need a border and it shouldn't be a xenophobic border yes when somebody takes American hostages we go after the person who organized it you need a robust non-jingoistic wait by the way powered by software because that's a single thing we do better than Iran we do better than Russia we do better than China let's just go around the world and talk about the state of play Ukraine you're working with Ukraine you've been working with Ukraine for a very long time now there's 50 billion dollars they're waiting for from the United States what do you think is going to happen look I don't know what the congress is going to do I I talk to people all over America some of whom are skeptical you have to move away from the intellectual arguments and think of this as it's like prison we show up we there we will be taking advantage of not just by Russia by by Iran and by China so even if you do not agree with what Biden's doing what I happen to think we should you cannot afford the president of the west loses and we should do whatever we can to help and then if you go around the yeah well let me just ask this I spoke to President Zelensky yesterday about what his future would look like if a foreign president Trump becomes the president again I'm curious what you think of that question you know what you don't want to fix the box in the next uh president of the United States you have we have to figure out a way to make these things work Israel how much longer does this go on and is there a way to effectively eradicate Hamas without more civilian casualties um Palestinians despite what you may be learning at your institution of higher learning this is all about making Iran feel that this is no longer acceptable at the moment Iran feels the cost too high this will change and there's no other way to change it and so I don't know what that point when that happens but what American Israel have to we're figured out a way to do is signal strength while reducing human casualties it's very very hard to do can you imagine a two-state solution where the Israelis trust the security without some form of occupation for a period of time we are so far away from those discussions well there will be no real discussion until the hostages are free so like right now it's like the hostages have to be freed Hamas has has to be taken apart and then there will be a discussion look it's going to take a lot of trust building to make anything like that work and I don't know when that happens state of play China Taiwan I'm more worried about China than almost anyone I know but it's more mainly because the Chinese economy is clearly going to underperform the American economy and if America actually begins to invest as much as we should in AI related defense systems every day that goes by we get stronger and the obvious reaction to that about it from a dictator is to say oh wait I'm stronger today than I will be tomorrow so I'm structurally more worried about that than most people perhaps one of the other big topics here not geopolitical but technology and innovation is AI can't go down the street without somebody talking about AI Sam Altman is here is becoming it boy if you will the AI movement how do you see large language models both working with and maybe even competing against volunteer I mean look our US product I'm not here to push our product but it's like it's growing so quickly that we we're going to have to rebuild the whole company and the reason it's growing very so quickly is in the middle it's the beginning of the AI revolution was not large language models it was in the military and we learned a lot of lessons there that are people learning now currently for a business a large language model looks a little bit like self pleasureing if you want to move from self-pleasuring to transforming your business you're going to have to learn how to manage that model and integrate it into the logic and knowledge of your enterprise you won't be able to do that as well as you can do with pound here it appears that you may be on the trajectory to be coming part of the S&P 500 what does that mean to you well look we are we been profitable now for quite a while what one never knows how they decide to select people but we are we are committed to being profitable we're a very strong cut look the problems that exist now on the battlefield in in the intellectual arena arena and in US commercial especially are completely pound your shaped problems it's very important for our customers that we have shown the financial strength we have significant profitability billions of dollars in the bank growth that would be nice too and so but it's a lot about saying look you're going to rely on us so if you're relying on somebody you'd like to know they're strong and we're strong when when you think about the business briefly when we were talking about AI you said at some point we're just going to have to remake the entire business what does that mean look when you the the the shape of problems now is how do you move soldiers around how do you move missiles around how do you rebuild your enterprise the differentiated value of enterprises is going to come completely down to can you do that and that is so strong on the outside that of course it's re it's changing how we do things on the inside and what does that mean well we are go to market has to be different we're doing all the we did hundreds of boot camps last year as compared to like 70 to pilots the year before it's just a question of embracing the fact that the revolution is bigger than we are
