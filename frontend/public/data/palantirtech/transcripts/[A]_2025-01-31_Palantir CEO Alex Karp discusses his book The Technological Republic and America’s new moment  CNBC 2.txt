TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

America has the single best tech scene in the world, not the best, not the second best, but like basically the top ten tech scenes are all America. Which you see in market cap, you see in innovation, you see in the people you mentioned. The thing is, how in my view, how in my book's view is not an historical diagnostic of the past. It's only a diagnostic of the past to get people to do things in the present and the future. And the more people in tech, the more builders. Like what makes America unique is that we have a culture of builders expressed in technology. And the more builders that are helping the US government be stronger and better in superior to all other governments in the world, the better for everyone. And so I very much support all builders, everyone who's done something important, pitching in to make America stronger, better, and the West superior in America have a dominant position in the world. So I think these things are really, really good and obviously welcome them. And whether one was there yesterday, maybe we were alone for 15 years and that's okay, we're not alone now. Yeah, they're all there now. And there's been a shift in the posture of foreign policy under President Trump when it comes to talking tough, the things that you talk about, what makes America strong and destroying our enemies. Have you been supportive? Well, I'm super, yeah, I'm super supportive of my version of these acting tough and that's why, you know, look at the hostages. All of a sudden we have all these hostages, they're afraid some of them are Americans. And look, our adversaries need to know that they, as I've been saying for 15, 20 years, is like if they're not afraid of us, there's literally no way they're going to act rationally. In fact, they are acting rationally. They're not afraid of us. Why shouldn't they just represent their own interests? It's what they do. So it's, but there are really two ways America can be strong vis-a-vis of your adversaries. One, it's put the fear of death into our adversaries at any random moment, which I think is happening for the first time in a long time. And two, get the economy to be super strong, which, and if you look, like I said, in half my life in Europe, look at the difference between what's going on in Europe and what's going on here in Europe is like culturally similar, has, should have similar ability to produce technology, to produce builders, to produce innovation. And like the delta between what's happening in America and similarly situated societies is just enormous and compounding. And obviously, I would like our allies to do better, but for now we just have to focus on America and, you know, balance years thriving. What about the gap between America and China? You said that the U.S. has the dominant texting, one, two, and three. We think that. We thought that. And then we get a development like deep-sea. Well, you know, it's like, first of all, the facts aren't available, but what I think you're going to find is it's very, it's much easier than people want to believe to be the second mover because you can train on our models and do things we've already done. And that's a danger for America. Like we're the first mover, we're the first builder. We built these things. Only we could have built like a large language model culture. Only we have built a software culture at scale. Only we have built a lot of the technologies in the world that are disseminated. Some are good, some are not. It's another thing in the book like technology is not inherently good. It's good and maybe our hands, same technology is not good in the hands of our adversaries. We have to acknowledge that. But that just means we have to run harder, run faster, have a all of country effort. I think you're going to see that and certainly the tech community is woken up to the fact that second mover can be very, very quickly, especially if we've already done the innovation and the innovation and the copying and the innovation is something different. One of the things that we've seen at Palantir just as a much less important example is, everybody made fun of us. Everyone derided our kind of anti-woag, pro-maritocracy, built software. There's actually valuable for an enterprise. They go to a do a DPO, is there an IPO so that individual investors can make money? Full alignment. Now a lot of people want to copy us. But copying is not actually as easy as it looks. If you stick to your internal dynamics of how to build, what you're building, a culture of execution, it is harder to copy than people think. It's still possible. It's easier than you'd like it. That's basically the situation that I see that we're in America. We have the lead. We have to focus on making sure we keep it. Our adversaries are going to copy anything they can and try and innovate on top of it. I was going to say, what are we up against when it comes to China and AI technology? Well exactly what you saw. It's basically a derivative of what we did with improvements at the margin, both in terms of cost and certain innovations. But that just means we have to innovate harder. Of course, I think there's going to be a huge policy discussion on how do we make sure some of our innovations are not actually exported if only indirectly. And so I think what you're going to see in the next couple of years is an acceleration of how do we protect the innovations that we have done? Because they are innovations that are an outgrowth of our culture, our people, the way we invest, the way we organize the fact that we believe in the law of law and meritocracy and have higher beliefs. These are all very unique aspects of America that really currently only America has at scale. Then how do we protect that so that these things are not stolen, manipulated, used against us? I think you're going to see a lot of discussions around that. I'm pretty optimistic around that. I mean, they're the national security concerns. They're also the big shock on the cost. Does that make sense to you? They were able to do this for $5 million? Yeah, I don't really believe those numbers. But in any case, even if the point I'm making is the second mover has certain advantages, but the real advantage is for the first mover, as long as the first mover is running hard. So you have to take some of these ideas of how it's built with a great deal of skepticism. But the point I'm making is look internally to how you do these things. The first job, purely from an innovation perspective, like a pound chair, we are not as, we really don't focus on quote unquote competition. We focus on how do we execute, how do we make it better, how do we make the products, how do we create the most value ever seen in this area that we're in coding? Can you do it cheaper now? Well, we can do what we do cheaper and faster because of AI and because we know what we're doing and because we have essentially unlimited capital. And actually one of our big advantages, a pound chair that the tech scene has now is because now we hire engineers, they actually believe what we know we're talking about. Like honestly for like 15 and 16, 17 years, every time I told an engineer this is how you build a product, they're like, well why should I listen to you? Now occasionally they listen. But again, from a tech building perspective, the most important thing is what am I doing to make my product better, my offering better, better is defined by more value, cheaper, and arguably faster, which really the most value, the fastest way possible are the two parameters around like the way pound chairs organize internally with complete honesty. Like it's and with a total disregard for how you're supposed to do it. Like there's a certain way you're supposed to build software. There's a certain way you're supposed to build a company. There's a certain way you're supposed to build all sorts of things. It's all, it all doesn't matter. You have to build it so that you get the maximum value proposition at years or decades before anyone else could do it at a speed in cost that the customer could never do for themselves. Do you have any other, do you see the open AIs and Microsoft's doing that? Look, as I mentioned, I'm very focused on what Palantir does. Palantir, Palantir's view by the way, it was also derided was the models were commodities, the management, I've been saying it for years, everyone thought it was insane, stupid, counterproductive, or we were only saying it because we weren't involved in building LIs. But now, of course, most people believe that. And at least for the next couple of years, I strongly believe that's the case. You see it on the battlefield, you see it in commercial, and you see it in quite frankly the way in which our partners or customers react or are offering and the react. But the way they react very strongly, positively to what we're doing because it actually is disruptive and a positive way. They also react very strongly and positively to it because in fact, the way we're doing it embodies a cultural way of organizing around tech that all these companies actually want to embrace, meaning flatten the hierarchy, get to the value proposition. One of the biggest trends in AI that's not quite understood is that the AI, large language model, Palantir ontology revolution, if revolution is defined by who gets paid, then clearly we're doing something right. So that what people are actually trying to do is reduce the organization back to what it was intended to do. A software company is intended to make your company better at what it does, not parasitically transfer the revenue back to the software, the provider of the parasite under better favorable financial terms. A institution has a core mission. What is that core mission? Does it execute it? Does it execute against the cheapest, most efficient and safest way? There may be many ways to do that, but one way that I think people can increasingly see that works is by Palantir. And so especially the US. How about Kinnigat? How about Kinnigat? I mean, I think we can help transform the way in which companies are run in the US. And I think the US GDP is going to be very, very significant growth. The fundamental limit to Palantir's growth at this point is, can anyone besides America adopt that they rate America's adopting? The fundamental limit for Palantir's, can we keep up with the adoption that you're seeing, especially in US commercial, which is just like, we do not have enough people, we do not have, we have a nascent sales force, we're doing our best, we have all these companies that are training on installing Palantir, they're getting up and running, we're doing our best, what can we do? What about the new administration? You also have a lot of government contracts, and this is an administration that has been much more focused on AI, installing key people in jobs to focus on. Well, I mean, the people who, like David's tax logic, obviously clearly very strong and know what they're doing. Does it help your business? Well, you know, look, our nation is more important to us than anything. And you know, first we have to look at, you know, we are in the business of making America stronger and better. That's our first and primary objective. So, and we will, we're going to work on that. And you know, I'm optimistic, look, where you get, the more meritocracy you get in any way, the better Palantir does. Bring meritocracy to your institution, you're likely going to be bringing Palantir to your institution. So we love the spread of meritocracy and transparency and installing software, software is the most efficient way to change your unit economics. There's been, there is nothing like installing software that actually is transformative for changing the unit economics. You're both on the top end and on the cost structure. And you can do it very, very quickly. And you know, I assume that, you know, the US government will be as interested as US commercial is in having those kind of transformations and I fully support it. And by the way, you should especially support it if you care about, you know, what happens to the smaller person, the person who's born into conditions that are not favorable. Because that's where these things drop off. The better our country does, the better the people at the bottom will do. And that's why, and you need software to do these things. What about infrastructure? They're going to spend now half a trillion dollars, private sector, our massacen and Sam Altman and Larry Ellison, to building infrastructure data centers essentially in this country. How necessary is that and how do you benefit? Look, I don't know, you know, like, it's funny. We run Palantir and this is like the most, like in the book, one of the things I'm pretty interested in or things that are true that are not persuasive. So I'll give you a statement that's true and not persuasive. I'm not actually running the business thinking about how every little decision can help Palantir. I'm not. And we're not, that's not how this business is run. It never ran this way. At the founding moment when I was sitting around with my co-founders, it wasn't like, how can we get as rich as possible? You know, it was like, how do we do something valuable? How do we make the value so great that even though no one wants to talk to us or be with us that they won't buy the product and keep buying it for their sake and then derivative of that. The reason we're questions that we got from investors and analysts. And then the derivative of that, of course, we're going to get paid because we create a lot of value. And I've had customers who, for whom we've created a lot of value, they're like, I'm not sure I can have all that value. I'm like, great. Okay. Most customers, most partners are pretty rational. If you've delivered something that's really valuable, they're going to pay you. So it was that way 20 years ago. It's been that way all the way through. How did we get five products that transformed the world? As two of them are like, or three of them now are famous. We changed the course of history with the anti-terror product in the beginning. There's a product that we use in Apollo that's actually really important. It's highly technical. Leave that aside. Then you have Foundry, an AIP or the OntologyDs products transform the world and are transforming the world every day. And the way we did it was by asking, what is the product we can build that will create the product we ought to build. Not even the product the customer's wanted, whether it was government or commercial. We never built the product the customer asked us to build. We built the product that they ought to ask us to build. And we absorbed the risk of that with our own money, our own sweat, our own risk of failure over a very long period of time. And until basically five minutes ago, we were derided every day, humiliated every day, shorted every day by people that should have been focused on their drugs. But those don't use their drugs. Not focused on us. And humiliated by people who did not like the fact that like I basically, many variables are progressive but highly anti-woke. Depp, am aligned for being pro-American, cursed for being pro-Western, protested for sure. It's all cool again. Protested every day for supporting our border every day. We had barbed wires because we supported a border. I'd been called every name in the book because I stood up for Israel after it experienced the attack, which would be equivalent to loss of almost 50,000 people, reminded people that any other country would have acted more violently than Israel has or did all these things over 20 years. And the reason why these things have actually turned into one of the strongest, best businesses in the world is actually comes down to we built the products that people ought to be building. And because of that, they ended up being the products people needed years before and then they began to grow into understanding they needed them. And then we grew the product on top of them. You see this across our business and that is a truly American story. It does not exist anywhere else. The fact that you can raise capital, build a business, stay outside the norm, organize a team, stick to your guns. And then, you know, I mean, a pound chair we believe and we are at the way beginning of our trajectory. But we are a modestly, a bit large company now. And that's how I'm going. Larger, I'm not sure. I'm just going to go compared to where we're going. But only could you could only do that in America and I'm grateful. And speaking out and having values is core. To you, Alex, to volunteer the company as you've been saying. And I do want to ask you about some of them that you have been very outspoken on. Including Israel, you were one of the only CEOs to raise attention for the hostages. We did that interview with Hersha's mom. And I am curious where we are in the stage of the war. There's a ceasefire. The hostages are being released. And we're seeing these crazy scenes of mom. Why I think in fairness, the only CEOs that you see, that went to Israel who run public and trade companies, are Elon and I, which, by the way, makes whatever you think of Elon, calling him a Nazi, especially since it seems to be highly correlated to having been supportive of essentially the Hamas wing of the terrorist movement in some way. It's not KZ causation, but is like completely absurd and like a complete rewrite of history. And so, yes, I was one of the very few people. There were others, there were Rowan, Ackman, Elon, I, Borla. Borla, really strong people stood up. But you know, you can name it. It was a handful. It was a very small group of people. It's now popular, more popular to have been pro-Israel now because Israel won. I mean, never, by the way, well compared to where they were on October 7th. By the way, never forget, it is really important to win. Like, when people start with this, another thing that's implicit in the book. When you're getting the, it's like a wonderful to lose and losing is great. Now, you have to win and you win. By winning, you show, in many cases, look, this is what a highly competent, highly ethical society does to win. And, you know, like, and by the way, they're very, they're very tethered and like, you know, you see, this is part of what's made pound, you're so strong. It's like, we make, we stick to our moral guns and because we stick to our moral guns, we actually make better decisions. Do you see this also in Israel? That's part of the reason they've done really well since October 7th. So much of what you've done and advocated for is playing out right now in the Trump administration. I know you said you're happy with what you're seeing in terms of the foreign policy posture. I'm curious why you didn't support him. I stayed on the sidelines. I've been, look, I've been historically a Democrat and I'm very loyal. I'm now an independent. I've been a very unhappy progressive. I'm still at that, which man I felt really tethered to the Democratic Party. Now I'm a much happier independent with progressive localities, but, you know, I'm an American first and I see, I agree with him. I mean, I'm not tracking every decision, but I definitely agree with the national security posture and I, I don't think you have a right to be in this country if you're here illegally. And if you're here illegally and you've engaged in a criminal act, like, hey, something I would tell my once, you know, I don't know if progressives even include me in their club anymore, but something I would really encourage progressives to think about, not just in America, but across the globe is if you're defending someone who's in the country illegally who's committed to severe crime and you wonder why no one's listening to you anymore and they're not going to listen to you in the future, you need to think long and hard about that. Like, no Western country, whether it's in America or Europe, it is tolerant of the average. America is a one American or European, as an example, are really decent, compassionate, wonderful people and there is no reason for them to tolerate someone engaged in severe criminal activity in their society. Alex Carr, one of a kind, not a typical CEO interview, the book, the technological republic, hard power, soft belief and the future of the West, is out February 18th. It's about all of this, Carl, and this is a much more sort of confident and emboldened Alex Carr, after a 400% run up in his stock price, the Economist magazine declared him CEO of the year in 2024. He is being proven right, he has vindicated on some of these ideas that he's been talking about about how good business makes America stronger. And that's really what Palantir is all about and what he's encouraging others, especially in Silicon Valley, in his book to do. And I mean, he's very clear and he's very open about his values and his morals and where he stands in the world. And I think that's why he's developed this cult following both with retail investors and much more broadly to a point where we're talking about progressive politics. Yeah, is there any topic he won't open on? No. I mean, yes, like, these are the topics that he thinks about. I ask him the topic because he is a huge military contractor and they have very strong values and beliefs about fighting for America and our allies. He was in Ukraine, for instance. He was in Israel, visited both during wartime and is providing software and technology to those. So we kept it on those sort of issues, but clearly, you know, he is an example of how CEOs have to be thinking about the broader picture and have values and morals. And he said before, look, if you don't want to come work for me because of it, fine. It's interesting because CEOs on the other side of the aisle, quote unquote, are told to keep quiet and not opine. But in this case, he appears to think there is no limit to what he can weigh in on. Well, I think he doesn't look at it as a necessarily a political lens. I mean, he's heard him. He's a happy independent. He said he didn't support the Trump administration, although he is very supportive of what he's hearing and seeing when it comes to foreign policy and bringing tech and AI into the White House. Look, his biggest point here is that we're in a new AI world. The geopolitical threats are there. Know who your enemy is and then use your weapon, which is software and technology to fight. And I think that's something definitely playing out now in the political realm, but it hasn't been in the last few years and he's been being the stronger of a while. They report Monday, right? They do. We weren't quiet periods. Couldn't get really into specifics on the business, but they are headliner for earnings next week.
