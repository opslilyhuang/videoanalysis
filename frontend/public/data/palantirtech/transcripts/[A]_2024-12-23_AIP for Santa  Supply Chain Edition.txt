TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to the North Pole Command Centre 2.0, where Palantir's AI platform has given Santa's workshop a high-tech makeover. You may have heard of AI agents, but have you heard of AI elves? That's right, we've taken Chris' magic to the next level. Imagine Santa's workshop as the ultimate global enterprise, facing the challenge of delivering billions of personalized gifts worldwide in a single day. Our AI elves, powered by Palantir's AI agents, go far beyond simple chat interfaces to tackle these complex, operation and challenges. From manufacturing toys to handling last-minute wishless changes, our AI elves work seamlessly alongside Santa and his team. They're not replacing the holiday spirit, they're enhancing it. As we dive into this demo, you'll see how Palantir is putting AI into production, ensuring every child gets a perfect gift on time. Let's explore how a making Chris' magic happen with the power of AIP. We start with a high-level map of Santa's North Pole operations across the lower 48. Here you'll see some pins representing Santa's toy manufacturing workshops, storage hubs, and the homes of eagerly waiting children. You can also see some key metrics on the plants. It looks like there are 30 active issues. Let's jump in and see if we can help them resolve some. Let's take a look at the top issue here. It seems as a production line, reconfiguration delay, reported by Elf Retooler. The switchover for manufacturing coding robots to microscope kits is taken longer than estimated. It looks like a 36-hour delay. Let's dive deeper and look at the impact of this delay using our North Pole supply chain ontology. Here you can see all of the primary and secondary impacts of this delay. By traversing the relations in our ontology, we can understand which distribution centers will be affected and consequently which children's orders might be impacted. Now, let's see what our AI elves are suggesting to resolve this. They've given us three recommendations to choose from. They've suggested to prioritize coding robot production and switch the gift rather than doing microscope kits, which I think is a good idea. Given the age range and interest, I think that's a pretty good switch. So, let's go ahead and take this action by resolving this ticket in the ontology. By taking this action, we're orchestrating changes across multiple systems in Santa's workshop to execute this decision. We're allocating inventory, reprioritizing certain orders to ensure every child gets their gift in time. Let's take a look at the next ticket. This ticket looks very similar to the problem that we've already solved, some sort of delay for the microscope kit. So, let's go ahead and swap this to a coding robot as well. We've just resolved two similar support tickets manually, but in Santa's busy workshop, we need our AI elves to handle common issues automatically. However, we can't let them make every decision unsupervised. That's where the North Pole wisdom keeper app comes in. This app captures a collective knowledge of Santa's elves, their experiences and insights that aren't typically recorded in a database or documentation. AIP has automatically derived from principles from the resolved support tickets, creating potential best practices. Here, we can see a new low inventory swap principle that AIP has picked up. Let's review it. It says, When faced with a critical shortage of junior scientist microscope kits, implement a strategic substitution with the beginners coding kits for kids. We've demonstrated interest in both science and technology. This is exactly the thing that we were thinking about when we made that swap. Let's approve this principle. This govern feedback loop to our AI elves allows us to continually improve our processes, keeping Santa's operation running smoothly. Let's see what the AI elves can do with a newly acquired wisdom. Here, we can witness the magic of the AI elves in action. The AI elves start working on incoming tasks immediately, galling contextual information from different data sources in the ontology, and using the principles that we've just added. You can see the support tickets flowing in from the left, going through the different stages to being resolved on the right. AIP flags where manual action or input is needed, ensuring that every decision is optimal. This process compounds our data asset, improving efficiency over time. With every ticket resolved, we move one step closer to a perfect Christmas. That's a wrap on Santa's supply chain makeover. By putting AI into production with these AI elves, Santa optimises every step to ensure that every child gets a perfect present. From everyone here at Palantit, wishing you a Merry Christmas.
