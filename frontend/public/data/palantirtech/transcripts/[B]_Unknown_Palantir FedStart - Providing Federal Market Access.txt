TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The US government is hungry for new and innovative technology. The opportunities for startups and established companies alike to deliver cloud-based solutions to federal customers are large and growing rapidly. Whether your company works in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, process automation, or any other category, chances are there are civilian and defense agencies that need and want your products. If you want to deliver your technology as a software as a service or SaaS to the US government, the first hurdle you have to overcome is getting FedRAMP or Impact Level accreditation. FedRAMP will enable you to serve civilian agencies, such as the departments of agriculture and treasury. An Impact Level accreditation will open up the Department of Defense Market. We are excited to introduce Palantir Fed Start, a solution that helps technology companies launch into the federal government market by dramatically reducing technical barriers to entry. Specifically, these accreditation hurdles. These credentials come with significant challenges, however, limiting the ability of innovative companies to rapidly deliver solutions to the federal government. For small or commercially focused businesses, this can create a massive chicken or the egg problem. Do we invest in accreditation now in the hope that we will have government customers 18 months in the future? Or do we wait until we have the customer interest and then hope they remain engaged as we make it through the lengthy accreditation process? This is why many companies choose to delay entry or forgo the federal market altogether, missing out on a multi-billion dollar software market and denying the government access to potentially game-changing technology. Fed Start is designed to eliminate this dilemma. By partnering with Palantir, companies can shorten time to accreditation to three months or less and move costs to a consumption-based pricing model that scales with your business. You can start your federal journey today with confidence that you will be able to serve your customers on their timeline. Let's look at how Fed Start works. Solution providers deploy their existing containerized applications into Palantir's already accredited Fed Start environment using open-source standards such as Helm charts. The Fed Start Kubernetes infrastructure, which runs on top of AWS Guft Cloud and Azure government, manages fifths validated encryption, logging, authentication, vulnerability scanning, and more so that you don't have to. Initial partners have estimated the level of effort to integrate their technology into the Fed Start environment to be only a couple of months at most. Palantir manages the detailed administrative work of receiving and retaining accreditation, fulfilling conversations with government accreditation authorities, producing compliance artifacts, performing continuous monitoring, and managing control assessments. Companies monitor and update their deployed and accredited applications with only one or two US persons, rather than having to hire an entire dedicated team. Partners pay a monthly cost based on consumption, just as they would if they were buying directly from a traditional infrastructure provider. We also look for opportunities to highlight our Fed Start partners, listing them in our online Fed Start marketplace and in the government's FedRAM marketplace. Helping with discoverability, Palantir also hosts periodic events with dedicated programming for Fed Start partners, and your potential US government customers. Palantir has supported complex and sensitive government missions for over two decades. And along the way, we have gained a ton of experience navigating the complexities of the accreditation process. Today we have over 50 authorizations to operate, or ATOs, across agencies in the US government, including FedRAMT Moderate, DOD IL-5, and DOD IL-6. Take advantage of our experience with Fed Start so that you can focus on what your company does best, delivering unique capabilities that can help the government become more effective, efficient, and successful. We can't wait to help you get started. For more information or to inquire about getting started with Fed Start, please email us at FedStart at Palantir.com. Thank you.
