TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Pallinger partners with the utilities across the globe to help modernize the grid, mitigate risk, and adapt the changing demand in production patterns. Utilities often have a complex data ecosystem, making it challenging to coordinate operations across the company. This factored data landscape of tabular, ERP, geospatial, and sensor data can make it very difficult to get a complete picture of the utilities network and all the things that may impact it. Leading utilities use poundier foundry and AIP to power decisions across electric operations, asset management, and grid resiliency. Today, we're going to dive into Grid360, which offers a complete view of electric grid. Grid360 gives me a common operating picture from my electric network. I'm bringing together data from all my relevant source systems, my GIS databases, ERP instances, garage management systems, ADMS feeds, live weather and risk layers, field programs, and more. This provides a fully connected view of assets, workers in the field, sensor readings, and critical risk factors that my assets are exposed to, such as weather or vegetation. It's used by hundreds of data analysts, electric operations users, engineers, and even executives. In Grid360, I'm able to look across my assets to form a top line connected picture of the grid. These substations, circuits, protective devices, structures, customers, and more are backed by the ontology, forming the foundation for my operational workflows. Our ontology also models the relationships between our grid assets. As an operator, I can quickly drill down the circuit min95 to see the customer service by the substation, which devices I have operating in that region, and more. I can also toggle on an asset management layer to view planned and completed work orders for a system hardening and vegetation management in the nearby area. Customers, assets, outages, work orders, and geospatial information are typically stored across at minimum five different enterprise systems. Bringing this all in a single operations platform is transformational. To illustrate this, let's say I just received a call to service min and finished patrolling the area southwest of min95. A wind event brought down a support structure holding up a river closer, causing an outage on the device RC32 and 100 customers to lose service. To safely restore power in the area, it's my job to monitor the status of my crew alongside live weather readings before re-energizing the affected segment. Here in the circuit detail view, I have a zoomed in view of min95, the customer's downstream of the disconnected line, and protective devices, circuit breakers, reclosers, and few savers we have installed on this particular circuit. The map here shows me nearby weather stations and their live readings on current wind gusts. Overlaid against this is a risk layer projecting future potential of high gusts over the next 48 hours. Courage of our in-house weather services team who publish their models in boundary. Each piece of information here comes from a different team, whether that be on the ground service min, weather services, or emergency management. But here in grid 360, I now have a digital control center with a connected view of what's happening in the field and everything I need to take action. Now that we're ready to restore power, I'll head back to the list of devices we have installed on this circuit. I know device Rc32 is where this average occurred, and looks like this is skated capable, meaning I can remotely operate this device. Control settings have also been recently updated and cross-checked by our engineering team. Here, I can see the current state of my device overlaid with recent outages. As I'd expect, the recloser is currently in the open state after this outage. I can now toggle this device back to its normal operating closed position. This sends a notification out to grid operations, the folks who have permission to perform the actual switching on this device in ADMS. This is how we get full visibility into the grid. Grid 360 brings together structured and unstructured data from across your systems into one view and makes it actionable. It's giving a unified picture of the critical information about your grid and allows you to create sophisticated workflows that drive your organization to move from local to connected optimizations of assets and work. It is foundational to our work with utilities and our customers have built hundreds of use cases on top of it.
