TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

So I am from the Boston area originally grew up in the suburbs of Boston and I went to school at Williams College, which is this tiny liberal arts school out in the western part of Massachusetts in the middle of the mountains where there are more cows than people I think it's pretty isolated, pretty rural. And did not ever study computer science or do anything sort of in that realm prior to college, I thought I was going to do sort of economics, business, e-stuff, which is what my older brothers had done and then ended up kind of falling in love with the CS side of things. In terms of what took me to the Palantir, I applied for actually a whole bunch of, I was looking for any internship or anything after my sophomore year that would let me sort of get more into the tech world since it was new to me. And Palantir was actually one of the only poises that got back to me. I got like ghosted by almost everyone else. And I think it was because I really appreciated that it wasn't just like send us your resume and you might hear back from us. I got to like write some essay prompts and I appreciate being able to provide that level of detail. But all that to say, I ended up working out and I had a summer internship lined up for after my sophomore year, which was going to be the summer of 2020. And then COVID happened. For a little bit, I was worried that the internship was going to be canceled. It ended up being fully remote. But it was awesome. I was so glad that A, it happened and then B, it just like be placed on an incredible team. I was in USG at the time and got to do some really cool work with the National Cancer Institute and then on this major COVID research platform that was spinning up with all these hospitals sharing data for researchers to do studies on COVID. And at the end of that summer, the decision was sort of brought to me of, well, now I need to either go back to school and do what do people call it, Zoom you do remote learning. And in particular, that was going to be my junior year, which I had been excited for so long to do my junior year abroad. And I have this program that I was super excited about that was a year long in the UK. And it did not feel like a great time to do that. And Palantir ended up saying, well, I sort of said, hey, is there anyway, you can just stick around. I've been loving this internship. Can I keep going? And so that summer internship turned into like a 15 month sort of like a summer and then an academic year in a summer, a very long internship. Yeah, so Alex Spiro, I admire his decision to stick around after he's had an extended internship. I ended up going back to school for to finish up my degree for the final two years and then came back full time about a year ago last July. But it was definitely a decision that was like kind of top of mind for me. It was not a given that I was going to go back. And so, you know, you made that decision to go back in retrospect. Would you do the same thing again? I think so. It's always hard to speculate on what circumstances were like otherwise. I think part of what did it for me was the fact that I had this year abroad program that I had been excited about even when I was applying to Williams. It was one of the things that I knew I wanted to do and that drew me to the school. And I think that having the chance to travel and be in an unfamiliar environment from a lot of perspectives academically, but also just personally, I think I did a lot of learning and growth during that year and just had a ton of fun that made it valuable. I will say, though, going back to school after having the perspective of volunteer, it shows you the best and the worst sides of learning, you know, being in college. There are so many times where this is always, you know, why am I doing this? What's the value of what I'm currently spending my time on if it's not delivering COVID vaccines or helping researchers do better research? And so there were some trade-offs there, but overall, I feel pretty satisfied. The fact that I'm back also makes it makes it sweeter. It's a little bit harder to have FOMO now that I'm here again. Awesome. Okay, so you went back, you did your year abroad. What was the experience like as, you know, someone returning who who done such a long stint as an intern that's quite unusual, I guess? Yeah, well, so when I returned, so I had done my internship in USG and I had worked on sort of the federal health area. And then I returned and I wanted to sort of shake things up or try out something a little bit different, just given that I had done the extended internships. So I joined in comm. And also though in kind of similar realms, so I did a pilot that was in the medical supply chain realm and then more recently I've been on hospitals as of like January, February of this year. But the first thing I noticed is how different Palantir was. I joined, I think, right into the AIP wave, which was exciting of course, boot camps were definitely not a thing back in 2020, 2021. So I was encouraged to see that. I think if I had rejoined the same company that I left, it would have been a very negative signal of sort of stagnation. I've grown since in the past two years, where I was bound to you're not grown. So I was pleased that there was plenty for me to learn that was new, while also still being able to like flex muscles that I had developed and also have this kind of like old timer take of, you know, back in my day, a Delta would use sleet instead of workshop and you're all spoiled with some of the new features. It's so easy now. So I've liked being able to pull up those old war stories. Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, how easy was the decision to come back? You know, imagine you had other avenues. Was it a no brainer? You were definitely coming back to Palantir. I think it was, it was in some ways very easy, but it was a tradeoff between a somewhat known entity that I knew I was satisfied with and loved. And then this other world vaguely defined possibilities. It was hard for me to articulate when I was thinking about returning versus going somewhere else what more I could look for. So I think having that realization made it pretty obvious that that it was the place for me. The thing that like stuck in my mind, it was this this quote, someone said like, well, have you even really worked many other places? And I've done some one off internships, but they were like, well, that's like marrying the first girl that you ever dated. And I just started chocolate. I was like, I suppose so, but I really had a blast. I just during my internship, I did things that I didn't think would be ever in the realm of possibility for me. And I had so much satisfaction that it just felt hard to envision myself elsewhere in being as satisfied. That's quite a recommendation, I would say. Okay, so you get back here. You've now been here. What is it going on a year full time? What's that year been like? Yeah, so I guess to give the broad framework of what I've been up to, I spent the first six months or so as TL on a pilot in the medical supply chain kind of realm, which was great. It was so I had worked previously in USG. And so now being on another impulse that was dealing with kind of logistics of a crucial supply chain for the strength and security of the country that's supplying hospitals with PPE and things of that sort was enjoyable. And that pilot ended up converting. And so it was a lot of fun. And then at the start of the year in around January, February joined the hospitals pod. And I would say it's been a whirlwind ride ever since there's been just so much activity and excitement and growth in terms of headcount, in terms of the number of customers reserving, the number of health systems we're working with, the number of people using foundry every day in hospitals. And I think that it's been a great opportunity to stick with something that's generally familiar of working in the realm of health powered by foundry. But with plenty of new aspects to keep it extremely exciting with like much more of an emphasis on AIP and a lot of our workflows with hospital operations and associated use cases being like a new realm of health that I hadn't seen before coming from more like research supply chain things like that. So it's been in my mind the perfect combination of building on things that I've already done but exposing me to new problems and new places to contribute. Yeah, and sort of a through line from the experience that you'd had on the USG side of things, you'd have this health flavor and then kind of running through into your full-time job. People talk about their first official year being about finding or figuring out how to make the most impact of their path here. Has that been true of your first year or has it been a bit different given your priors with us? Yeah, I think that there still has been a lot of finding my path and where I think that I fit in. I think the internship provided a lot of background knowledge about foundry and how Palantir works culturally but I think that I had sort of developed as a person in the period in between which helped me kind of realize other aspects of my personality that I can apply to my work at Palantir and I think that the biggest pieces there had been as an intern even though I never really felt like an intern. I sort of felt like a full-time employee during that time. There was still some expectation of this has somewhat of an end date. I'm going to go back to school and the notion of kind of outperforming as an intern was to do, was to just make kind of solid contributions and I think coming back full-time, let me rethink what does it mean to be unbounded and sort of just maximally ambitious about what an individual at Palantir can do surrounded by just incredible teams that are working to sort of find how I remember hearing from someone on hospitals that were recruiting recently. The question was what do you like most about Palantir and you give a great answer about how Palantir has a culture that's exceptional at finding and identifying the places, how to push people's buttons to make them the kind of best version of themselves at the company and I think that leaning into that during this past year has been something that I've appreciated the others around me helping me figure out and then thinking out for myself how to get there. And when you say you know best version of yourself if it's not too personal to ask I'm curious what that's meant for you as an individual. Yeah I think that so growing up I think I was a little bit in the bucket of the book smart rather than street smart kind of more intellectual more like not necessarily someone who who fit the bill for what I think of as the Palantir engineer who's the rebel hacker who's the just incredible bias for action outcome oriented high agency all these terms that we hear about and I think there was always the tension in my mind of well I'm a little bit of like a straight laced like perfect GPA student but I admire the the rebels and the hackers and the startup founders and I don't know that I had ever really explicitly like thought through what it means to hold both of those at the same time and I think that the message that is sent a lot of people sometimes is that you just have to have that innate ability to like be a rebel and I think it's been cool to see that that's not necessarily the case and I feel like in the past year that's been the biggest way that I've grown in a large part from just being exposed to people that are so incredible at just seeing the world as something to be shaped rather than like something that's taken as a given it's just this really distinctive personality trait that is so apparent when people have it and I think Palantir is like the most density of that trait that I've ever seen and it can be learned or brought out in people that might not have realized that they had it in them and I hope to count myself as one of the people in that bucket and I think it's a reason why I like being at Palantir so much because it's kind of an uncomfortable transformation to go through but it's also really addicting when you go from sort of treating the world as on rails to I actually can just chart any path that I want and what that means is there's no right way to build this software there's no like process where you must do ABC it's let's go into a hospital and figure out how to solve this and if there are you know barriers that are mentioned or if should we do it this way should we do it that way does this even work with the product well no then we'll build something new in the product and make it work like we're just going to do whatever it takes and sort of not accept like artificial barriers it's been fun to learn that skill looking ahead now to like year two of Palantir what would you say kind of you're most excited about heading into that year yeah I think continuing to grow the impact that we've seen on hospitals I think is just the is the biggest thing but but in terms of what it means to grow that I think one of the pieces there is having sort of finding leverage by helping other people realize the same things that I've realized I have been so lucky to have a bunch of phenomenal mentors at Palantir taught me sort of how to I guess be a Palantirian and I would like to do the same same for others to the to the extent that I can sort of help help them find a similar path and I don't think it's something where you can be too heavy-handed in trying to say this is how you should do it but I think that you can sort of plant the seeds in their mind and help them realize for themselves the satisfaction of thinking in that way and I think that I see that every time someone new joins and their eyes go a little bit wide about certain things that we do at Palantir you know you mean wait I'm really going to show up to this bootcamp and I'm going to be talking to the customer yeah I'm going to be building desk side with them yeah this thing I built this is going to be going live next week yeah it is and it's always fun to see someone knew the first kind of time that that's surprising to them and then as that becomes like more assimilated into their personality and then it becomes normal I think that's really exciting for me and I think maybe the way to sum this up is that like to a large extent Palantir attracts and selects Palantirians and finds people that have some of these trades but I think through an even larger extent Palantir like builds Palantirians and helps them like find that in themselves and bring it out and I have appreciated the chance to to work here and develop in that way
