TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Music Palantir is known for helping organisations harness data and AI to make better decisions. For defence that might mean optimising the availability of your people, ships, planes and tanks. Or being able to rapidly identify targets and what to hit them with. We've worked with Western militaries for almost 20 years. That includes over a decade in the UK, which is also home to more than one in six of our employees. The highest proportion among the world's biggest 20 tech companies. And this is the thing that's perhaps less well known about us. Our software offers a foundation for the brightest defence tech companies, like Hadion, to build on top of and deploy their software at scale faster. Music There are lots of challenges facing disruptive technologies when deploying into classified environments. From long procurement cycles and meeting stringent security requirements to gaining access to data and building a software infrastructure that meets the MOD standards. This is why the MOD's commitment to three-month procurement cycles is so important for defence startups in the UK. It's partnerships like the one between Hadion and Palantir that make rapid commercial exploitation actually possible. Hadion provides out of the box simulation and orchestration tools that are used by armed forces to rehearse, train and plan combat scenarios. Lebrigen the potential of AI, these tools rapidly generate scenarios that represent both virtual and live environments, greatly increasing the speed and efficiency across the entire mission plan in life cycle. Hadion's Domini AI product is a next-generation command and control system that accelerates planning and decision making through fully integrated AI and simulation. It embeds diverse data sources into a single, clear and actionable format to provide real-time situational awareness, allowing you to simulate forward and determine the best course of action. RAI needs to understand military concepts the same way operators do. Units, missions, rules of engagement, Palantir is the bridge that lets our simulations speak the same language as our live operational systems. Building this ourselves would take years and delay capability delivery. You need to integrate classified intelligence feeds, logistics data, sensor inputs and historical records, all with different security classifications and formats. Palantir solves this problem out of the box, which means we can focus on building the best products rather than focusing on data planning. This partnership with Palantir will allow Hadion to turbocharge its existing relationships with the MOD, continuing to build on our enterprise agreement and expand the use of our suite of products. Hadion is currently providing its cutting-edge training software to the armed forces, but with Palantir's foundry, underpinning the products, Hadion's software can integrate seamlessly with the existing MOD data fabric and deploy faster into live environments. This partnership with Hadion is a vital part of something broader for Palantir in the UK. We struck an agreement with the Ministry of Defence earlier this year to make the UK our European headquarters for defence. That agreement also formalises the use of our software to help British Defence tech companies to bring their technology into operational use faster. And also to help them sell into the US, the world's largest defence market. The Ministry of Defence has been clear with us that this is what they want us to do, and we are determined to deliver. It's an incredibly exciting mission for us. It will help to support our armed forces, it will help to keep our country safe, and it will help to drive the success of a new generation of British Defence tech companies. The Ministry of Defence has been clear with us that this is what they want us to do.
