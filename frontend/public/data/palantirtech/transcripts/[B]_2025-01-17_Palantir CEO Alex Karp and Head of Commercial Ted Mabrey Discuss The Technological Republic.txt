TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

This institution, Palantir, first of all, we can call it institution now finally, has produced products that have changed the course of history. As is the single most important organizer of talent in the Western world, that's not bluster, it's a fact, is the single most important pedigree, meaning degree you could possibly have, whether you went to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or a school online. Once you're here, you just went to Palantir. In visioned a way of building products that everyone derided, meaning customer to product, extending the range and amplitude and power of that product, in many ways, and in fact, presuppose the rise of AI, both algorithmatic and LOLMs, not just as a matter of theory, but in the product. Was the most important culture to say what is now becoming increasingly obvious that pagan versions of prejudicial thought are no more interesting if they're on the left or on the right, and has become a jogger nut and tech, as expressed by getting on the S&P and our other various successes? There's a way this company is organized that no other company in the world is organized, really no other company in the world. The closest things you can find to the way Palantir is organized is special operations and one or two clandestine services in the world. No other, I've never, I interact with, you, we all interact with lots of companies, many, many, many great companies, and what I hope happens with this book is the West especially learns how to reorganize, to build institutions like Palantir. And so, yeah, with that, that's why we're here. Yeah, and one of the reasons I'm most excited about the book riffing on that is that I expect it will improve Palantir's performance because it will prove, essentially, accelerate the journey for everyone at Palantir to understand what it is we do, and more importantly, why it is that it's done, which for me has been kind of a... Why do you think that? Because I thought that was, you know, what was it in the, that you saw in the book as like, like an accelerant to, because again, I think the hardest thing for in the indoctrination process of Palantir, first of all, is always, everyone thought we were going to fail. So it's hard to change how you see something when everyone's like, well, changing how you see something is a great way to have fun here, but it's not exactly preparation for your future life. But even if you believe, as I think, certainly most outsiders believe this, and think, it's a... Like, there's a way in which you organize that actually can work. It's still very dissonant to anything you may have done at any institution, or it is. Yeah, well, I think that's probably the primary thing of my journey 15 years here is most of the things that I value about that time most are the unlearning of the things that I thought I had to learn. And what kind of unlearnings and what do you think is in the book? Well, especially alongside the before it was successful and then it's successful. A lot of the internal dissonance is you're doing something completely differently than an innovative way of how you're supposed to do it. We aren't successful yet. That must mean we're doing it wrong. So we have to change the way that we're doing things. And then... But... What is dissonant? I mean, a lot of people here are so... I mean, most people here are so early to Palantir that they don't even know. I mean, I could give you my version of this. I'm very happy to... I'll give you a start with my version of this. And then it's like a normal institution or normalised defined by an institution that I don't believe is ideally suited for building software production is organised around essentially the endpoint being the point of value extraction is where analysts say the software's valuable because it basically, in often a parasitic way, graphs on to an institution and turns the lower quality fluids into higher quality fluids by essentially throwing off a higher margin and a higher growth rate where the host can no longer get rid of the parasitic entity. And there's a famous... And so... But then you work back from how you would do that. Palantir absorbs the risk of the institution's own set and needed outcomes. So if you work back from the... The clandestine agency or the Special Forces or a bank or an intelligent service, what is it that that institution seeks to do? And what is the output that would allow it to do that in software production that would make both reconcile its core mandate and then deepen and broaden it in a very rapid time manner. So riffing on that is one of the primary initial critiques of why do you go to market with Ford to pull it engineers? Very intensive. It's not going to scale. It's services, not software, all of these tropes that we've heard for a long time. Yet my lived experiences, of course, no matter how good your product is. If you didn't engage in a highly interactive way with this customer, they're not going to be able to adopt the software to do the things around reorganizing it, building on top of it and how it's going to work. And so that idea that, well, if software... Not... The interesting question isn't services or software. It's what is the degree of alignment. And then if you are more aligned with the customer, you're going to create more value. Yeah. And there... Of course, there's a lot... If you steal man the critique of software... The primary reason no one built use services in any part of the software stack is because analysts may be correctly thought if you begin with... There's a lot in this. If you begin with services, you're going to show value to the client and you're never going to break the cycle of moving from services to product because doing product, as we all know, is really F and hard. And... And so that's point one. You tend to be skeptical of that migration. There's one point in there where I think it's very subtle. When we did forward-played engineers, we were doing two things. One, we were figuring out not just what they thought their problem was. We were figuring out what we thought their problem was as a universal scalable problem. And it would work across all enterprises. And two, and this is where I think are kind of willingness to be mad, men and women really paid off. We were not in what... We thought the problem was. It wasn't just what the problem should be. It's what the problem ought to be. So, you know, Shom has this whole riff about how one customer in government... The interesting thing is, the one customer in government, like they're your customer basically and the traditional idea to shut up and do whatever the fuck I tell you to do. And the parent here version of that is, no, we're going to figure out the problem you ought to... You think that you actually need to solve. And then we're going to build the product you ought to build. And that is extremely dangerous because first of all, the client may fire you. And so then you have no revenue and you've got a business. Second of all, again, to point one, you might get stuck in the services cycle and then your business is actually not super valuable. And third of all, if you audaciously build the partner ought to want but doesn't want, A, can you get them to buy it and what if they're right? And so, but I think what's very, very cool about the parent who generally is the structure on the inside does not reflect the structure on the outside. And then it is like... Like I talk to the parent who's all the time and I ask the parent who's like, why have we been so successful? And the usual answer is the talent, which honestly is a kind of non modest but I think very true answer and like everyone's like, yeah, my talent. And that's true. Actually, we're very, they're very talented people here but it's of course interesting that's everyone's answer. But I think the thing Pallantarians miss is normally companies reflect the structure of the people that they're selling to in a weird way. So one of the things you pointed out in your notes to me and online, you know, and you're, I think you published it, at least internally is, you know, in every company that you will meet, everyone has the same role. It's like every company has the same roles, right? And it's so obviously a mistake but since everyone it does it, it just stays that way. So if you're like, I don't even know these titles but if you're VP of Finance in one company, that equates to being VP of Finance. Okay, at Pallantar, there basically no real roles, right? So we mobilize the whole company against the outcome of the partner as defined by the outcome they ought to want in a couple of years and that we're going to want. And we're only, we're very aligned because if we are right, we're going to do very, very, very well, which no one believed. We believed if they're right at the very least they're getting something they could never, ever produce themselves. But the internal and external organizational structure are in no way the same. And this is crazy radical. I want to corner you on the internal part. So one of the most annoying things of dealing with you is most of the time when I ask you what to do, you say, I don't know, figure it out. The times you do tell me what to do and I ask you why, you say I can't explain why. Explain. Well, that's actually very true, by the way. And yeah, well again, I just want to drill down on that. Pallantar works on that. We borrowed from a lot of cultures, a lot of cultures, for deployed engineers are stolen from French restaurants and in general. That's where the whole idea came from. So it's like you shouldn't have fresh truncheon like why is the food so good? Well, it's because the waiter is an expert in the food and is preparing the food all the way to the end. And if you ask for the craziest dumbest thing that would blow up the restaurant, they're like, go somewhere else. And I was like, well, that's obviously, we got to be 10 times better than everyone. No way we're succeeding in the US government unless we're 10 times. By any metric, 10 times, 100 times better. The two parts of his question is like figure it out. Okay, well, first of all, the reason we hired the best, most aligned people in the world is for most, and we slot them. So like, I would say my job at this point is what slot should you be in, you know, and somewhat, like, and is because the German term for doesn't translate really well. An alf-trog is a mandate. And an mandate is different than an order. An order is I tell you to do 15 things. Fourteen are stupid. You do them. The whole thing sinks. And you're not responsible because I told you 14 things to do and on the boss. The mandate is I pick a slot for you where, for whatever reason, we think I think you are going to be the best person we could possibly find. And we're like, this is the problem set within the context of how we roll and your years of experience, figure the damn thing out. Okay, so that's the mandate. And that's how Pound your wicks, alf-trog, not with orders. And it's interesting because everybody who's non-Germanic thinks of the Germanic culture of, you know, somebody with a German accent saying something, you just follow up. Like, it's just not how the German military works. It's not how anything I think of high quality works. It will not work with Pound Ontarians because everyone here has a massive discount rate. And I don't think it should work with people of a certain level of talent because it's like, you're not my indentured servant. And you will figure out and understand things. Now, then there's the corner case of, it's outside the mandate, it's really creative. And let's say in this case, I'm the person who's got to make it work, which is not always the case, but at the top. It's like, when you're working at a level of your true artistic capacity, you will be able to figure things out and have biases that are likely to be true, not always true. But because you can figure them out with very sparse of no data and because you have a propensity for being right, the act of explaining it is just an artificial construction to help convince the person to do the thing that is very likely to be right. So you're losing a lot of time. Sometimes you need that time. Sometimes I'm bringing Pound Ontarians along on, I don't know, 20 years, 18 years of explaining, we are going to win. But the truth is, I just envisioned we were going to win. And there are lots of reasons and lots of permutations. But at the level of true artistic creation, the act of explaining where you're right is very, very different than the act of being right. And this is one of the reasons, personally, one of the major reasons I left academia, there's a lot of reasons I left academia, honestly. The combination of unpleasant people with very little impact and huge undeserved egos in most cases that are massively ideological and predisposed to being wrong while certain that they're right. You could think they were analysts, but they're academics. So any case, right? Yeah, I think one of the most interesting sort of thematic things, the primary takeaway of the book is things that almost look like contradictions on the surface or if you were to sort of bucket them into different tribes in society, you're just consistently contradicting them. This tech is great, tech is terrible. The institutions are broken, the institutions are required, constantly back and forth. And then I think internally there are so many of those contradictions that look like contradictions but are not contradictions. And so let me give you a couple and how do you think about them. One is, I think one of the primary themes of the book is lambasting the lack of any normative opinion on what we should be building in technology. But then there's also a lot of discussion about how to build technology and lionizing glorifying the Silicon Valley culture that will iteratively travel and define and figure out what it is to build. Kind of that balance between, I think, use the analogy of the fox and the hedgehog in the book. How do you sort of explain this, like, not enough opinion here, too much opinion here? How do you balance those things together? Yeah, well, these are really cool questions. But, well, again, there's, let me, I'll start with what I think is going on here and then I'll try to unpack it. I think a very successful structure that's of any kind, where the structure is defined by it has to have more output than input. So you could call that a business but honestly that could be anything. You're a great writer of philanthropy that wasn't, you know, was actually doing important things, something that may exist. You have to simultaneously drive deep enough to get a unity and be open to the fact that you're not far along enough to solve all the problems and then drive those things far enough against you, you get to the point of artistry where the artist, whether that's say me in an area or you in an area or everyone here can go to the final mile beyond what the non-artist could understand. So you're really getting a lot of the contradictions into the structure. Now what does that mean in practice? It means, you know, like, okay, so if you just take, we are a product building company that uses our primary form of research for doing that are forward and deployed engineers. That is massively a huge, it's an irreconciable contradiction for the receptive of most business people. But if you're able to do that and you're able to push the frontier of the product into the services, you can unlock a lot of things and again, you can set up the table for a world where you could unlock more with AI and LLMs. And that's only possible where you have a concatenation of people who are working at their complete and very unusual spike so that they can see in the services product, productizations. And so that's the product internal version. The moral kind of like, you know, so that's also like, you do need a bias of how to build product, what a product does, what it would mean to build a product, meaning we build what it ought to be, not what basically in the past venture capital and analysts want. That that's the kind of overarching framework. But then the way you actually advance that is by being open to experimentation, opening open to clients having new data sets and new insights. On the societal side, I think one of the things that's very corrosive about discourse in the West is you're kind of forced into these very farcical obviously simplistic things. Like tech is good. Okay. Well, I don't think anything as powerful as technology is inherently good or bad. It could obviously, if you're, it's like obviously what we're doing in Palantir could be used for nefarious bad things, which is why we've always restricted what we sell to, in my view, the forces of good. Now you can debate and there would be debate in this room about who are the forces of good. But then we drive that debate more openly than any other company I've ever seen. Certainly any company that's ever gone public in the history of at least American companies, I know of no others. It's like we're not hiding behind what we believe. In fact, it's a little bit, so it's, so, but we're also, we're not, we're saying within the prism of what we believe to be good. Like, I believe the West is superior. We could, you know, it's like, and I believe it's actually superior, especially in the places where the people disagree with me. So most people who think the West is not superior have a narrative where the West is somehow trampled on human rights and is pro bigotry or, of course there are problems with the West. But on that very score, the West is the only set of nations that have actually ever cared and done anything about this. So, but, but then, so we, and it's like as a culture and as a company, we on the product side and the on development and how we organize our anti-platitude and pro contradiction. We build the breast products in the world by starting with services. But we're aware, and then we're willing to fight for decades to show that that was the right way to do it. On the other hand, at the, and we do, and we expand that by finding like the, the contradictory data sets that allow us to deepen and deepen. And then on the outside, flowing into the inside, I see that as tailored to, yeah, and we're not obfuscating the complexity of what we're doing. It's, you know, it's like, I would say as a final feature, Palantir for, as controversial as we've been throughout our history. And as likely as it seemed to everybody involved in Palantir that you were doing a noble project for which you would not be paid until about three years ago. Um, we, one of the reasons we got the best town in the world and today organized them in a truly radical way was we never, ever tried to feed the most talented people in the world, a diet of obvious, like, you know, uh, uh, synthetic, uh, slightly carcinogenic, uh, ingredients that smart people do not believe. And that it's like you get everybody you'd want and you don't get anyone you do want. So yeah, let's double click on that on talent and on people. Another thing kind of drawing the book and the external diagnostic with the internal diagnostic is there's a lot of talk about people that, uh, our way of life is responsible for in the past that were also deeply flawed in some way, shape or form. And oftentimes internally, it's a lot of, we need people with spikes, we don't need people well-rounded, talk a lot about actually really seeking intellectual conflict. It's like, do you not know assholes or all assholes, uh, as, as a, you know, maybe there's not a binary answer to that question along the way. But looking at kind of people, uh, embracing flawed people or maybe just embracing real people, uh, the actual motivations that are required of them to do thing or how to motivate them in real ways versus fake what you'd like to be actually motivating. You talked a little bit about how you view internal and external talent. Well, I mean, this won't be news to anyone internally, but, you know, externally, I actually think a lot of the questions externally are interestingly like, but is it true actually that, you know, we do these things internally? Is it true that like, you know, for like a lot, there are a lot of people who are new to Palantir because like we went from being three years ago, kind of a niche company to being now millions and millions and millions of people view us and we have millions of shareholders. And, um, so the people who are newer to Palantir who haven't watched, you know, these things over the last 20 years may not be aware. Uh, we, I've been saying, and we've been doing this for 20 years and yes, 20 years ago. So, but one of the biggest things we do here is like historically when you go to many of you went to elite universities and I would say especially those universities, they seem to want or getting into them. They seem to want, you know, people with like all A's and you have a sport and you have your teachers write glowing recommendations. And I don't know, there's just a general vibe you're going to be governor someday kind of thing. That's what they want. Uh, that's not really what we're looking for at Palantir honestly. What I want when I talk to somebody and I mean I did a lot of the early recruiting and I'm walking around here and now still is involved as I can be. I really want somebody who's like A triple plus at something and I tend to think it's more likely they're A triple plus at something if they're F minus at something too. Now there are exceptions. The great Bob McGrub, great at everything. And I don't mean that facetiously just like, you know, it's like there may be someone out there in this audience like that. I'm mentioning Bob because I'm not me. Yeah, yeah, not, yeah. Not anyone writing the company now. And although Bob you're very much welcome back to a really decent, wonderful person. And but it's just assume that A, you're not Bob and B, that's not as a matter of rule. That's just in general a real exception. There have been roughly 8,000 people or either at Palantir or were at Palantir or just under 4,000. I can only think about. And I interact with thousands and thousands. If you think you're that person, it's like this famous saying when you're playing poker or a table, you don't know who the mark is, it's you. You know, very likely if you think you're that person, you're making a grave mistake in your life and you're sitting next to it. And what we want at Palantir are people that, you know, where we can identify a massive, easy one and quite literally one and a half million talent. And we want you to hopefully embrace that and work on it all the time. And then I was telling someone this morning, it's like what you want to do is find something that's really, really unusually easy for you and then find the hardest problems ever in that domain and solve them. That's what we want, that's what we reward. Now there is this version of, I sometimes wonder, have I just built the company to make everyone dyslexic too? So it's like, it's like, you know, I built this company, it's like the sub-subconscious motivation is, you know, you can be dyslexic too. Now I was, is the only thing I've ever really been in the closet about. And now I just think of it as like, yeah, I was so far in the closet, I just built this company where it's like, yeah, you think you're not dyslexic. If you're not Bob McGrew, you're probably dyslexic. And so I'm going to make you do this thing that you're otherworldly good at all the time. And I'm going to help you understand how cool it is. And that's, now again, where I would say this is much, even much more insightful than it has looked in the past. Okay, in the past, when we started this company, you know, we built this incredible product PGA, but like we had very limited technical means. Like there were no LLMs, so we had to use LLP. There's like, we're using, you know, the integrations were nothing like what we're doing. Is it compared to what we're doing very, very simple? And that's why the industrial market was much, much smaller. It's still very powerful, especially in Europe stopping terrorism. Could someone in Europe thank us for that? Eventually, some exceptions here. But any case, I did actually really change it. But, okay, but in a world where you have LLMs and you have foundry and you have the ontology. The single most important thing for an institution, a country, or an individual is to harness your unique and highly individual boarding on artistic talent in the context of that and transform the institution into a world-beating, but also completely unique institution. You know, the thing about the homogeneity and greatness that's inflicted upon most people in most institutions, it's not just public, but certainly private, is it is ideal suited for a world where the most valuable thing in the world is being unique, artistic, individual, and creative in the context of being able to harness large language models and AI, obviously for people here that would mean an ontology. But that ontology actually is pound-eared plus your unique brain, or the tribal or particular realistic insights of your country or your institution or your mind. And I would say, if you just look out at the world right now and you wanted to map what countries, what institutions, what individuals are going to massively outperform, what you're going to find are the ones that can lean into something that is particularly, valuble, about what they do, how they do it, and can be institutionalized essentially with a right function so that you have the individual other worldly insights in a unique way of doing it. So America being particularly American is going to lead to huge results. A insurance company, a manufacturing company bank, military, of course, military is the best example. How do you fight? With whom do you fight? How much do you value the human life of your citizens? How much do you value the human life of your adversaries? How much are you willing to go out on a limb to fight for your people? Are you willing to be unpopular at a cocktail party in order to save the lives of your people? Like Nat, are you better at hardware or are you better at software? Are you better at the hybrid or are you better at one or the other? Are you more likely to be the aggressor or the person who acts after? Does your is your adversary technical? Is your adversary willing to sacrifice their people for you? Does your adversary have an advantage in elite or non-elite institutions? What assets do you, what is your supply chain like? How can you, how can you update, is your supply chain in your target chain integrate? Is it integrable? Can you, can you get rid of the political fissures that are built into your military? How many of you can you get rid of them? What kind of authorizations are you going to do? Use, can they, do they need to be hard-coded, soft-coded? What is your reaction time? How many engineers do you have available to your society? How good are those engineers? Are you able to be honest about how good they are? Are you able to be honest about the fact that your country is not producing military-grade software and no one is likely to build it? How do you deal with that? And the answer to all those questions basically comes down to, can you organize your society in a way that's particular to its strengths and weaknesses where you highlight the strengths and get rid of the weaknesses in an ontology that allows you to take the generalizable things from the specific i.e. large-language miles, code them ethically i.e. code. And then if you're not America or not, how the fuck do you do that without Palantir? That's a real question for a lot of countries. Like they're not going to buy Palantir. I mean, I don't need to pick on like bands in Germany, like, okay, before I just, I don't want to move on. Because I think that riff was the most, I think the most important thing that you've said. So if you're watching it, stop, go back to the beginning of it. But what I think is important about is it started with an individual, right? How do I view myself, my unique talents? How do I deploy those? How do I deploy those with maximum ambition? And I think a lot of what you sort of lampoon in the book and a lot of things that I've had to unlearn, frankly, coming here, which is what I hope everybody at Palantir can unlearn more quickly, is where do you have agency at? What level of the conceptual stack, at what level of the company stack, at what level of the market stack, at what level of the society stack do you have agency? And where are you accepting previous structures and saying, okay, like, if I went to Princeton and I worked in investment banking and I get a job at a hedge fund, like, I can have agency in that way. And I think you're reordering of saying, like, actually agency exists much, much more first principles lower down in the stack of saying, how do I reassemble these things? Because that's actually where the interesting agency is, is not taking all these kind of calcified societal company, et cetera, structures, and then saying, you have to take all that as a given, and then you have this one Iota of creativity where you can do something. And I think what you're saying is, like, no, you have to really think about it. Like, who is the person? What can they do? What group of people can you get to work together against what problem? Who are they? Why are they likely to succeed and really being honest? And you have to be completely honest. And again, I think the honesty threshold is, I mean, institutions, obviously an individual struggle with honesty. And we all struggle with honesty because a lot of that is like, no, I cannot be the person that can do a BCD even though I really, really paint, it's very painful. And then institutions and society struggle with this because it's like, tech is in no way fair. Very few people can do it. So then there's a question of how, then once you deal with that truism, then you have, then you have a lot of political issues, which I think we could help out with, which is, how do you scale up people who are not going to be world class engineers to being fairly close to world class? And there's a lot you could do with AI and ontology. And I think we should do that. And we definitely need to do that in America because we have all these very smart people who could be made to do engineering things. And we're seeing this across our customers. And honestly, it's just a really cool thing. And it's been a huge advantage for us. But the single thing that I would really hope, Palantirians, first of all, that take away from this is, yeah, the agency begins with the first crumb. Like, how are we going to do this? But if we do this in a way that where we're completely honest about the resources we have and we need to get, especially human resources, you can actually basically set off a bomb. You can build an agency bomb that just like, again, it's like, look at the bomb, look essentially, the societally changing things of PG, Apollo, Foundry, AIP, Maven. So how do you do the honesty part? So because I think that's like maybe the most important part. Like my internal riff on this is the very best Palantirians. Like everybody here smart, everybody could get an A on a test if they wanted to. But the ones who really thrive here are the ones that are capable of starting to learn things they didn't want to learn. Like it's uncomfortable if they didn't want to learn it. It clashes with what they hope to be true. All of those different things and I think you're then saying that's true micro and then that's true macro. How do you get more honesty? Well, like, look, a lot of this is constitutional for those of you. Like, D&D had all these ratings and like, you know, we are all like, again, some of us have very high constitutions, some wisdom, intelligence, some of us don't. So it's, but I would say one just at a political, societal and individual level, if you do not do this, do not come running to somebody when the whole thing fails. So my version of this is everyone in this room should be exceedingly happy. See, I don't know if people can put the cameras on the room to some extent, but, you know, it kind of looks like a room of people average age looks like 22. Maybe it's at- But grizzled. Like grizzled, yeah, well, we're in the fight. It's, we're doing serious stuff and, you know, we have to win if only to humiliate our enemies. And we are built to win. So it's like, we're not fucking, that's the other thing about that. We're not fucking around with this, like, you know, losing, you learn to lose and like, you've lost 50 times, you've learned from that pain and, no, you're just losing. There's never been a moment of pound you. I can tell you this. I've been here 20 years and we have never, ever had a thing where let's just do that and lose. That does not exist here. You should not accept that. So we don't accept that as a modus operandi here, nor should you accept that. Whatever your political institutional beliefs are, that is a recipe for disaster for everyone involved. Especially, people who are less fortunate, like that just, like, it does not help the less fortunate of society to have societal structures that do not deliver any value. In fact, those people are the people who suffer the most. And, and I, so, but at an end of, it's like, if you want to be happy at the right age of 40, you will focus on like, what I view is like artistic development. And you develop by understanding what it is you're doing and where is it actually valuable and where it is. And it's like a banality. But you just, you have to somehow imagine how painful it's going to be to have your level of talent and to be unhappy because it hasn't, you've not done something that you really believed in at Palantir for hopefully forever. Most people that stay at Palantir are happier than most people that leave. Just putting that out there. Picking that up, I think two things that you said there that I want you to riff on. One is the, you know, because this is- By the way, this is actually typical of a meeting. So, you know, those of you what in the audience here and those of you later watching this, you may think this is like some surreal act. But this is actually our meetings. Maybe it's a little bit- Nobody gets to talk about what they want to talk about. So moving on. Well, I'm talking about what you ought to want to talk about. Not what you want to talk about. And now I know how much it sucks to be my customers. Yeah, okay. It's like, why talk about what you want? You might, you need to talk about this. Okay. There are two things though. Now back a compliment. Two things you've said to me that have been very formative for me was this. I never played Dungeons and Dragons, but the idea that intelligence and wisdom are two different characteristics. Right? You can be smart and- Or you can be dumb and wise and smart and wise. And this concept of like, you need to believe in something. And Palantir, if it is nothing else, it is a- It is a company of believers. And on staying or not, you know, along my different time, I think there are definitely years where it was frankly stupid to stay. Very stupid. But very wise. Right along the way. Like we weren't winning the whole time or winning in a way where- No, I mean, like 15 to 18. I thought starting in 17 at the end, we were turning it around, but no one thought we were winning 15 to 17, 18. So on that, it was, okay, it was dumb to stay, but it was wise and why. Well, it was like, believe in what you're doing. And a lot of that, I think, comes down to is like, if you believe in it, you're going to be more open to being honest about evaluating what works or not, because you're committed to making it work. And then a lot of the critique in the book is basically this just absence of belief and all of these kind of hollow structures that have replaced belief in our broader society. And so I wonder if you want to riff a little bit on like, why believing matters. And then also on the contradiction point, you know, a lot of the things that you make points are out is like, how do I force myself to believe in something when I have no data in order to do it. And here's the Palantirah company that manages data, helping data driven, et cetera. But a lot of the way you make decisions are not data oriented. They are a deeper belief oriented. How do you think about that? Well, it's, you know, it's like belief or not belief. It's very hard to convince people who have no beliefs. They should have beliefs. So I would, if the audience was like people who don't have beliefs, why should you? I would start with, it's like heart is like explaining colors to colorblind people. But I would say as a matter of fact, you will be healthier, happier, and more successful if you have a belief structure. They probably don't believe you on the more successful thing because it's like this Macavellian thing, but then of course it depends how you define success. But I even think on the narrow metrics of like least important but maybe financial success, you, there's a lot of decisions. And of course when I say belief, like for example, people in the audience might think like every time we are like writing a line of code, we're like, you know, this line of code must be, you know, conform to XYZ. It's much more like on that level, it's like yes, we believe we are doing something really important and that has to seep into every little thing we do. And but it's very hard to convince people who have no beliefs that they should have beliefs. And I think one of the feature sides of Palantir's, you know, pretty prickly like, it wasn't a review of us, meaning man, you know, like getting up and being, I mean the caricature of true guys like we're the first large important company to be and I think are the only, but one of the few to be like basically anti-woake. And but and I think that served, we, we had a lot of people Palantir who disagreed with my views on this all the way through. But I think they stayed because they that they had beliefs. And so even their believers can talk to believers easier than believers to soft, soft, but it's a, it's like, I don't know, it's synonymous with, are you religious? But it's, I do not, I think empirically, I do not think you can build a country without patriotism of some kind. It shouldn't be xenophobic, obviously. I think one of the big issues in organizing modern day Germany now is, you know, it's very hard to organize a society. You do need rational patriotism, but that makes people in Germany very uncomfortable. And I think one of the big reasons why so many, even companies in, in our space really aren't going to do as well as people think is on the inside, the leaders, the belief structure is not always, but sometimes it's just like, I want to get this company to the point where I can get out. And then everyone feels that. And and then I think if you're really driving to do that, people sense that. And then you end up with people who are not going to go the final mile. The final mile might just be, yeah, God, that person's better at me than doing this. I'm going to let them do it. It might be the obvious working harder. Quite frankly, sometimes it's just sitting there listening to somebody who's purchasing our software, you know, give a long conversation about how to build a software company and they have no idea what they're talking about and not telling them, wow, that's stupid, just saying, oh, that's interesting. Now buy the damn software. And but and I would say for me personally as more like an advice thing, you know, if you don't have this, these kind of things in your life, you will see that your life is empty and you probably will end up with like friends and partners that are less interesting and may not be friends and partners actually. But it's very, I do think one of the cool things about Palantir though is we do prove that a living, breathing, believing organization actually can disrupt in a way where anyone looking at the numbers who does not care about any of that has to kind of pick up the page and say, but how are they doing this? And I can tell you how we're doing it. We're organizing the best believers in the world, getting them to feel, you understand that what we're doing is so important that you actually have to throw out everything you've ever learned about how to organize yourself and do it in a way that actually works. And then we're dividing the proceeds of what we do with everyone who invested in our company that includes everyone in this room. Maybe last question. I know why I'm happy you wrote the book. Why you're a busy guy? Why bother writing it at all? Well I mean I was super happy with the questions you sent over. I wrote the book to elicit those questions. Now there's so internally, externally, how do we organize? How do we organize in the West? How do we organize in a way where we're more productive and happier? How do we solve a lot of problems that I think we have in the West like lifting up people who would not participate in the tech culture, so making them participate? How do we build organizations that have more output than input, which is what we do in government, annual and commercial? How do we get people internally to understand this actually makes sense? And one of the values of a slightly intellectual treatise is, or like put it maybe in the negative way, I think beyond all the obvious ways elite educational institutions have failed. Maybe the biggest way they failed is they're not giving you an intellectual architecture that in any way can be attached to the emotional architecture and the operational architecture by which important things actually work. So when you come here, you've mainly been taught how to read texts that will art basically kind of the gateway drug to intellectual and financial in the sense that you'll probably fail servitude. And I believe this like an intellectual rendition of what we've built at Palantir is the single best way to allow people who aren't participating in the Palantir juggernaut to connect to the underlying logic by which it works in a way they can intellectually and emotionally relate to. And I hope it starts a journey for them for like, wow, all these things that I was taught was a way of making people, making it palatable to me that I should sit there with an Excel spreadsheet, misunderstand Palantir, not actually get valued for my mind and at the end be deeply unhappy and end up in partners and relationships that are corrosive at best and painful at worst when I could have been a free person. And I think the political consequences of that are, you know, especially in America will be, you know, it just, you know, will be helped and otherwise very successful country just even be even more successful. And you know, nothing, nothing changes the world like a quantifiable success. So for all the 20 years of talking I've done, we've done others have done. Most people are now willing to hear the message because while they, in the past people are just chuckling, it's like I'm like, I'm like the bear in the zoo, grizzly bear that can walk in a tightrope and juggle and, you know, it's hugely entertaining but not that important. So now, someone's got to make a t-shirt. Someone's got to make a t-shirt. So now people are going to listen and they're going to do their damnedest to change. And I want them to change for all of our sakes. And then internally, I want the process of being put in basically, I cited a golfman in there who did a whole thing on the total institution. Total institutions, like you go into prison or an asylum and it like you're surrounded. And if you've ever been to one of these institutions, like if you get an insane asylum literally after an hour or so, you're like, oh, they seem so normal. But making the process of like acclimating to the palantir, dare I say asylum, much easier, faster, impactful and deeper, which will help all of you here and it will help you in whatever you do the rest of your life. Yeah. Well, that's exactly what I got out of the book, which is, you know, even after 15 years, so chaotic, it's so hard to reason about why these things are happening to me oftentimes. It's very hard to process that. Do I want to keep dealing with that pain? And the book was very helpful for me, even 15 years later, to be able to put that into that logical framework. And a lot of my experiences, something happens, I don't understand it. And then nine months later, it's like, oh, that's what you meant in the concept of doing that. I'm very excited that we will have that logical framework. Again, I think it will dramatically accelerate the palantirions that are willing to read it. Of course, nobody will do it if you tell them to, but don't read the book. Yeah. I haven't even said no one read the book. Don't buy it. Don't read it. There's vast secrets in there. But you don't want to read them. You don't want to read them. Don't read them. They're hidden from you. I do think it will ramp palantirions a lot faster. So I'm very thankful that you wrote it. Thanks. Thank you for reading it and everything else. Cool. Thanks. Thank you. We'll do it again another time because it's like this was a lot of talking. But thank you, everyone.
