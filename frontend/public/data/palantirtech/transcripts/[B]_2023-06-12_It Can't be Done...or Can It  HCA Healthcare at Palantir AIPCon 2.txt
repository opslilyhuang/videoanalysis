TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Thank you all. It's really great to be here and be able to share a little bit of our experience with you as introduced. I am Katie Sage. I'm the ABP of Clinical Operations, a registered nurse by trade. I'm Ben Spears. I'm a director of Management Engineering for CTNI and historically I've been on the labor management side and that's, I think, important part of the story is historically there's conflict between these groups and for those not in healthcare, giving an example. When I was dating my wife who wasn't nurse, her friends met me, found out what I did and they were all petitioning for her to break up with me. I won them over, like I won Canaan over, but there is conflict historically and you'll see what that's important. I think that's a great story to kind of paint that picture and kind of what we're going to tell you a little bit about is how our teams come together and how we've been able to deliver a step change in healthcare that we're very proud of and we hope to see kind of continue to grow through healthcare. I'm going to start with telling you a little bit about our organization, a little bit about our background and really focus on the people part, the piece that I think is important. And then I'm going to turn it over to Ben and let him share a little bit of the data port. There's a lot of people here that I'm sure are really interested in that that's just really not my cup of tea and hence why this relationship works so well and oftentimes works not at all. So HCA healthcare is over 180 hospitals throughout the United States with a few in England as well too. Our impact that we believe we have in healthcare is really painted perfectly in these numbers. 93,000 nurses work for our organization and one of the things that I know you all are very well aware of is that healthcare experienced quite a shake in these last couple of years with the pandemic and the challenges that that brought. And one of those prominent challenges was around staffing and our ability to deliver the right patient care that we were trying to achieve. That affected our organization as it affected many other organizations and it's what led to our desire as an organization to think about things differently. Our leader Dr. Slasher created a care transformation in an innovation department or team or wing within our organization that is focused on taking a step change in healthcare and really delivering that through clinically led innovation. And I call that out because that's where I want you to know why my importance on the team is just a little bit more important than Ben that clinically led part. You saw that too right? Jokes aside I think that's been part of the lesson that we've learned throughout healthcare and why we've had challenges in progressing and moving forward has been not our inability to listen but where we were listening and how we were applying that. Ben mentioned the relationship between the process improvement teams and our financial teams within our organizations and then the clinicians themselves and somewhat of that balance or that approach that takes place day in and day out. And a lot of that comes from the ability to have access and understanding to data and knowing what's there to be able to have those discussions. For us our care transformation innovation team our focus starts with building out really from the bottom up and starting with our clinicians. We have two hub locations which are really an opportunity for us to embed our members of our team side by side with clinicians learn from those clinicians understand what their challenge points may be before we even begin to design or create operational challenges or challenges to those operations that are in place. We then have two other larger facilities and why that's important to kind of touch on is the realization that we're in an area that requires a strong balance of risk and reward. The understanding that if these are high stakes and high pressure environments changes that we make to our healthcare process can have very positive impacts on our patients. They also could result in some possible risk that we wouldn't want to see and with litigation that was brought up earlier being a significant part of healthcare unfortunately we have to balance the idea that if we're going to make changes we need to be sure that those changes that we take into account what the downstream impacts could be and the very best way to do that is to do that on-site with the team and understand the challenges that they're having. The other part of that is being over 180 hospitals there's a lot of customization that goes into the way that each individual hospital operates and each individual unit within that hospital operates and so understanding the why the Simon Sinek I'm a big believer in him as well too so I love hearing that today. Understanding the why of those challenges and why they may deviate from what is maybe an accepted standard of care is really going to help us understand how do we attack that challenge and that change and move forward in our process. So when we challenge the idea of taking out first and foremost staffing particularly coming right out of the pandemic you know there was a lot of people that believe this was the right answer it can't be done we can't theoretically change the way that we approach this. Staffing for many many years has been about taking what's available to you and as team members come in and labor team members come in they they give us their availability they work on the shifts that they have we wanted to take a little bit of a different approach and we wanted to understand and value our employees somewhat differently and so we presented this idea to a few different companies and this was a direct quote from one of those companies it cannot be done what you're trying to achieve and another organization that we met with we worked through part of the project and we realized that maybe it couldn't be done with this group and this team and then we found a new partner and that partner was Palantir and I think what you'll see on the screen is that there were a lot of similarities and a lot of alignment between our organization and our thoughts and where we could take the steps to improve that and to put this process into place. We've heard several things called out today the speed of deployment the the ability to integrate with our teams and be on site and I'm very fortunate to share actually a few photos of our teams working together right on site. This is at two of our innovation sites two different innovation sites and on this picture to the far left is actually one of our groups of Palantir team members and someone here is in the audience from that team that we both very much appreciate the opportunity to work with day in and day out because what's different about Palantir for us has been the willingness to understand the why the willingness to embed themselves with our teams in fact sometime push us hey we haven't been on site in a little while can we go back that type of relationship and that type of interaction is really what has led us forward into to being able to build forward a platform that is transformational there's no other way to say it and what I think it's done as a nurse myself it's empowered nurses to have better conversations about needs better conversations about how we support each other and better conversations about how we deliver the very best care we can possibly have and I will say that over time I've learned to appreciate that process improvement idea and how we can work together through that and so at this point what I want to do is turn this over to Ben for him to bore you I mean to provide you a little bit of the details around how we achieve this new process in format. Thanks Gainer for it. So this is what it looked like today so unfortunately you have what are in the black boxes compared to the orange boxes is we didn't know and we had no insights today and on those black boxes we didn't know what the original schedule that was posted was because we didn't have changed data capture and so many changes happened after the schedule post and as a company we talked about our scale but what that looks like is 2000 nursing departments with 3000 leaders us trying to teach them what's the right way to balance and post a schedule we have 20% turnover within those roles and it's very tough to get to those 3000 individuals in time this is the right thing to do and this is the right schedule to post and we saw a lot of variation we saw a lot of bias and to be honest we didn't really know what that looked like we had assumptions but we flipped over to future state we now have all these data points we're able to see on the staff input side system inputs we turned it on and we're like oh my gosh we we understand we need change management because this is a big change but I don't think we truly appreciated what the change was going to be until we were able to drill into our data and see some of the practices that have gone on so how our process works is we have the staff give us information about themselves so we have the talent profile to understand what kind of roles they can do on the unit how we get their schedule preferences we marry that up with volume-demand prediction business logic to generate a schedule we want that schedule to be 95% the way done we want the the manager to then review that schedule before posting we we're strongly believe that the automation is not going to do 100% there's going to be nuances that the manager needs to do but in the current process that we have today because it can't be done it's it's relying on that nurse leader and that's 10 to 20 hours going on every month with the nurse leader having to build the schedule across 2000 apartments 12 months a year this new process has been very successful so we've been able to get that number down to one hour so 95% reduction at some of the best utilized hospitals and in departments that we have and we're really excited so this is what it looks like we're utilizing a handful of different workshops throughout the process we have the personal workshop where staff members are able to enter information about when they want to work request PTO those type of things we have the staffing workshop is where the managers will go in run the schedule hit the automation come back do their edits post the schedule and then we have the staffing workshop and the facility workshop to take care of all the edits that need to happen after the schedule post because we need to insight and we need to overview the CT and IT and our executive leaders can use those dashboards to understand the process look for ways to improve and educate and coach that feedback loop back to those nursing leaders we've really hit on the value to the nursing leadership but to the organization of a whole having ontology and having this data is transformational for us today what it looks like a bunch of people like me are looking at the tea leaves and looking at the smokes and trying to figure out what contract labor and what kind of premium utilization we're going to have this month and next month and do we need to bring in these contractors at this rate to kind of fill our needs and we were able to build screens where we can turn that art into a science and we can have everyone calculating it the same way and it's so easy to access the data it's so easy for us to merge the data with other things the other use case that's been brought up is how do we now that we have all this information we can almost do a forensic level analyze of each of these staff member schedules let's let's mirror that up with turnover information and see what is what are the root causes of when we have these turnover can we identify issues whether that be orientation process so today we know we have a best practice of what orientation should be we've turned it on we have the insight we know what we say we should be doing and what's going on our hospitals are completely different so let's tie turnover rates to preceptors or when we say we want one preceptor for the whole 12 weeks are we actually doing that or are we bouncing around 12 other people and they're not feeling involved so this is kind of the road map that we are so we we kicked off the partnership in January we've quickly scaled I'd say this the slide is a little optimistic and it looks pretty we've had some road bumps along the way and like to share that with this group I think the biggest thing in innovation right and especially in health care as Kandah mentioned is there's this desire to always be perfect and when we have bugs or we have these fixes there's a it's it's even the quote I heard yesterday it's rewarding to close the ticket and I think we've had to what happened is we kind of got into this three-week period at the end of March and leaking into April where we have our short-term architecture as we transition away from our existing solution and as we move to the long-term architecture we had some I'll call it issues with the short-term architecture and we were spending a lot of time trying to fix what the problem was right now but when we go to August all that work is going to be thrown away and so we had to look herself in the mirror and be okay with breaking a couple things and saying in the long-term to hit our medium-term goals it's going to be okay to break some things at this smaller scale and that's really what this department's about is understanding that it's okay to tinker it's okay for things to break in a safe environment we're going to may ask our department leaders at these hospitals to wear a little bit of the burden for the short-term knowing that we're going to build a product so much better six months from now and that product is going to be able to serve all of our nursing leaders across the company the one thing I want to say in this process and really want to call up volunteer because I've been really impressed is they understand where very aligned and what our goals are and there's been moments especially going from 25 departments to 50 departments where the scale the difference between the departments we are expecting to see or we experience to the 25 moving to 50 there was differences and so we even gave them out hey let's here's a short term fix we're going to give you the short-term fix and it's going to create technical debt it's going to make life harder down the road but they're like no we do not want to do that we're going to do the right thing we know it's going to be harder now we're going to do extra work now so we can hit our goals and so a common theme today has been speed and we're quickly transitioning out of that building the product and transitioning into speed and so we plan on going to five more facilities in August with ultimately the goal to hit 40 by March of next year and trust was another big thing that came up this morning I think without volunteer could this be done I'm not sure but I do stand up here today and have the trust in the faith and our team to hit our goals and just I know there are a lot of them in the room we're listening and we'll give them a thank you as well yeah and I think the last thing that I will add to that is you know when we were younger we were probably the guys in the back of the class that were told we were disruptors right and that was not a good thing to be but in health care when we've been able to disrupt some of our general thinking and some of our general thoughts and do it with the the support and the the power that Palantir has brought with the data it truly does become a very valuable resource the feedback from our front line team members obviously is one that could be a little bit uncomfortable at times but overall time and time again we hear the words thank you and those are the words that we want to leave with the Palantir team as well too and that is thank you for an exceptional partnership and we look forward to sharing our story with Boomer so hope you'll have a great day
