TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

This company has a strong engineering culture and they've been able to very quickly take on the platform and make it a core part of their tech infrastructure. The third generation manufacturer grew up in Detroit. From my earliest days was inspired by the importance of manufacturing as an industry. At Festradius we believe the impact of cloud manufacturing will be as profound on the physical world as cloud computing has been in the digital world. We do as igniting and leading the mobility revolution. We're unlocking a value of connected vehicle data and autonomous vehicle data. How on earth foundry supercharges our distribution to thousands and thousands of new suppliers and new solutions and industry. Foundry unlocks the business potential of our own. We found ourselves constantly trying to twist our business to fit inside someone else's perspective of how businesses work and that didn't work. They've been using soundry as their data operating system so end to end from cloud hosting to data kind of integration from different data sources through a using a lot of the out of the box connectors that we have in the platform. From there harmonizing the data using open source languages like Python, SQL, using Spark as their distributed can compute engine. We're collecting data in every part that we make today. Data about the design, data about how that part is made in our factories, data about how when that part is moved ultimately to our customers. Speed is our superpower. Speed to me means real time processing of over 17 billion data points a day. In fact we've processed in real time over 12 trillion data points. Our business is premised upon high quality data and the understanding of that data on the part of people. Once they have the data asset, we've been just building a number of operational applications both for their internal kind of operations to help like super charge that but also for even kind of external third party users as part of their kind of tech offering. Foundry enables us to build solutions fast and unlock unique intelligence for industry. For we Joe, a partnership with Palancy was the obvious choice. If you're not using Foundry, you better think about what your position in the company is because everybody will be using Foundry.
