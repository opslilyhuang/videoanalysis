TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Please welcome co-founder and chief executive 
officer at Palunteer, Dr. Alex Karp. [Music] Uh even this working is it working? Even 
I find that motivational. It's uh it's pretty good. I should just sit down. It's like wow. I 
don't have anything else to say. But um at at the risk of regurgitating the one thing here, 
it's like that Silicon Valley uh we've been at odds with Silicon Valley on and off for since our 
inception, you know, 20 years ago where we were essentially patriotic and um that was optional 
in Silicon Valley and kind of viewed skeptically. um being pro, you know, America winning was kind 
of like um I don't know, kind of like being into origami in high school. It's like you didn't get 
any dates. People kind of felt sorry for you kind of vibe. It's like and you're like, "But my my 
swan is so beautiful. Why why can't I get why doesn't anyone love me or even like me or why?" 
And um uh but uh and interestingly now we're largely aligned certainly in private um this is in 
private become uh the one place in America uh that um is really really disproport disproportionately 
uh uh showing the world that we can do things that really don't exist it in the western world like 
the the way in which we scale tech, build tech, create build things creatively. Um, and 
it's actually a place where people still believe in basic uh controversial concepts like uh 
meritocracy, agency. Like we actually believe that you can start off with something that looks crazy 
and if you fight really hard and you surround yourself with highly annoying uh but the most 
competent people and that's often correlated. It's not causation but you could if you were building 
Palunteer you could think it's causation. It's uh somewhere between causation and correlation 
um depending on how much sleep you've had. Uh, and we, you know, literally do not care here 
where you were born, where you came from, what your parents did. We just don't care. And 
I, you know, I spent half my life in Europe and, uh, in Germany, a tremendous intellectual 
culture, but yeah, you will more likely end up uh, where you were born uh, when you're 50 or 
60 than any other variable. And that's just not the case in Silicon Valley. The what what I think 
where we're very aligned then though in in in like became very aligned with our our partners was uh 
and I really underestimated this choice by simply saying we're going to build the product that's 
going to make this government agency superior. And by the way then you know it's like all these 
conspiracy things online that like they got us and it's like it was actually the opposite. 
We fought the government. the government. We actually there were two big things that 
led to where we got here. One, we're like, we're going to build the thing the government 
ought to build, which is data protection while finding the bad person. And that the alpha, it's 
very similar to alpha in a business is margin and growth. It's not one. Alpha in government is not 
finding bad person. It's finding bad person while enhancing civil liberties or at very the very 
least making sure those civil liberties are harder to evviscerate. That's the alpha and but 
then the underlying proposition was we are going to build the whole company around what creates 
the most value. Now it was partly because we in great part because we believed in it. It was also 
because we and especially I had the sense no one's going to buy this product from us unless it's 10 
times better because they are not looking at me and saying you look like me and I'm going to buy 
that product. uh uh you know I so and if you build downstream from value creation you end up with 
forward deployed engineers, echoes, deltas, devs, uh very few trained people and the reason you end 
up with forward deployed engineers especially in the beginning is you have to extend the product 
and the product we built in the beginning was essentially uh how do you enhance uh data 
protection and find terrorists in a context where you don't have LLMs and so you have to use very 
primitive of NLP technology. And the the answer to that is you build this incredibly difficult to 
build product with a team of the best engineers I think anyone's seen in Silicon Valley in decades. 
But then even that didn't work. So we had to have people on the front end who are essentially 
engineers extending the product to a place where the product couldn't go. And why did we do that? 
I again those of you who are, you know, I don't know, over 40 know the punishment of doing that 
meant that every single financially trained person was on the other side of the business because what 
did everyone know as a fact? If you're doing quote unquote services, you have a one multiple. Nobody 
wants to invest in a business that has a one multiple. So, you are screwed. Uh, and in fact, 
the fact that everyone thought it was a cult, we kind of were, was what saved the company 
because we were so in our cult, we were like, "Huh, multiples. We're not interested in that. 
We're not going public." So, you know, uh, but but if you then fast forward to now, what is driving 
our business in the US? Like, and it's like, yeah, of course, we have the best partners. You're the 
best partners. Uh, what defines a best partner? A partner is somebody who is wants to create maximum 
value in their business. Uh meaning revenue and margin shift and everything that is kind of 
downstream of that safety goes up, happiness goes up of employees, workers. You know, one of the 
things I do think Silicon Valley is totally effed up. It's like in overhyping the value of LLMs by 
by not listening to our treatises of truth that an LLM is a raw material that has to be processed and 
the processing of the LLM will change America and change the world. By overhyping the LLM and saying 
you're going to have AGI tomorrow when of course that wasn't what was going to happen. you had to 
go adversarial to to workers because you had to say, "Well, of course you're going to disappear 
tomorrow because our LLM doesn't work the way it should today and isn't is very valuable, but 
it's not without an ontology archite architecture around it to make it predictive, a very unsemingly 
powerful predict tool that's built on statistics, more precise. you had to say the less precise 
thing is going to be fully valued tomorrow. And so instead of doing what it should have done, 
which is you can actually transform your business by being open to different ways of doing business. 
And what would that mean? It would mean anywhere where human ingenuity can be enhanced. Whether 
that's the worker, whether that's the person running something, where the person who's in 
charge of a part of their business can take large language models, use them inside their enterprise. 
And what does that mean? It means uh extending the human mind. It means being able to use the large 
language model to change margins, to increase safety, to increase revenue. And how do you do 
that? Well, of course, the model has to interact with an understanding of your business as it is. 
What is your business? It is a concatenation of your insights, your knowledge of how to run the 
business, your competitive advantage, which is essentially tribal. I know how to do this in a 
different way than anyone else. The highfidelity data sets in your business. Um, and your ability 
to orchestrate the large language models outside of your business while being inside an abstraction 
of your business. You would need something like ontology and foundry. Maybe you could get it from 
someone else. And you would need forward deployed engineers on our side to teach your people how to 
be forward deployed engineers because there's a way in which you still have to extend the product. 
So it's it is extending your uniqueness. It is not making you a commodity. And by the way, this is 
where we're aligned against what most people view as a business cuz we are not building. We want a 
non-commodified business. We want a business that is completely differentiated than anyone else's 
so that people struggle to compete to the point where they just have to complain about you on TV, 
which is what happens to us every day. Everyone's complaining about, you know, it's like, oh, you 
know, it's like that's what you want for your business. And that's exactly what you can get by 
taking essentially this very, very important raw material and using it in a processed form in 
your business. And I I think this is why we're so happy with you and I hope you're as happy 
with us as we are with you and why, you know, we can and I think basically transfer over time 
our financials to your financials because we're doing exactly the same thing. And then what I 
personally love about this is it gives a massively unfair advantage largely to businesses in this 
country. Why? Because if you compare corporate culture in America to any other country, you have 
highly dynamic meritocratic structures that are plastic in the sense that people will move and 
change to what works, not what worked yesterday. It is like Germany is an incredible culture. But 
the way in which the corporate structure works is the whole corporate structure is in charge for 
like 30 years. Like it is nearly impossible to change how you do things. in America, we're like, 
you know, what the we're just going to do what works. And then you have a native essentially this 
is a native capacity. It's in America. And that also makes a is a huge differentiator because de 
facto. It's very hard to accept a new way of doing things if the person explaining it is not rooted 
deeply into your culture. And so this like just completely hypercharges industry. Um now it also 
hypercharges government which is why we're doing very well in government. Although it's worthy of 
note whenever people are like Palanteer is doing too well in government. I was like yeah we are 
doing very well but it's 40 points less than how we're doing in commercial. But any case, what what 
makes me really look forward to these conferences and every time even more is we are fully aligned 
with making sure your world looks closer to our world, which is you're able to radically increase 
growth, radically decrease margins, and increase the happiness of the people in your business 
at all levels of business, including workers. And that is actually the real promise of the AI 
revolution. and uh you know and I'm really happy you're here and then the other you know it's just 
like it's incredible to have you know it's easy for you know like in the end of the day people 
are going to think well yeah he's in charge of the company he's a large owner of course he says that 
well again that's why we have people here it's like one of the things we learned when we built PG 
in the beginning was we could run around telling governments it's the best product or we could 
put people in the room and you could talk about your experiences good bad ugly And and then what 
you're doing here is you are actually a change agent function because in fact you got on the boat 
and the reason why I'm grateful to you, you got on the boat before anyone else. And now everybody's 
like, "Huh, I have a bot in my company that's not really working. I have a piece of software in my 
company that was basically you know I don't know like we every single company we look at there's 
like I don't know in at scale there's like a billion dollars of like duplicative software that 
is just a Frankenstein monster lurking in your company preventing you from doing what you want. 
What is it you want to know? I want to know the cost of goods. I want to know how I'm going to 
increase. How am I going to be more efficient? How do I deal with a a situation where there's 
macroeconomic disruption? Like, and and the thing that's impeding you from that is the software that 
is lurking in your system that you somehow can't take out. And we're going to partner with you to 
do that. And you're going to partner with us to make your company great and occasionally tell us 
that tell other people that you we helped you and that we're not the freak show that people think or 
we are. My my favorite compliments in government were like honestly from the special forces. 
They're like, "Man, you guys look really freaky." And in the beginning, I didn't like you, but 
when you save help save my buddy's life, I really learned to like you. And another lesson in Silicon 
Valley is we are able to learn to like people and partner with people. That in the beginning, we're 
not exactly our cup of tea. And we do this as a culture. It's one of the most underestimated parts 
of our culture. American culture learns to like what works. And that's a very rare quality. Uh 
it's very different than like other interesting great places in the world. We really do learn to 
like and value what is working. Not what worked in the past, not what could work, not what they 
say at Berkeley philosophy department is going to work. not what some crazy person on the right 
left aspires to believe could work in a society where that wasn't differentiated that didn't have 
technology that didn't have finance and didn't have any enemies yeah lots of things work under 
those conditions including you know the faculty lounge at Berkeley but in this world Americans 
learn to like and love things that actually do work and give disruptive value and that's 
essentially what we're claiming to do with you as partners so very happy to have you here. Delighted 
and I hope you have a great time. Take care. Bye.
