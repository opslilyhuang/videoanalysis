TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Okay, so that was a perfect thing to follow. Because look at the investment we have made in trucks getting things to people. And what I want to talk to you today about is the lack of investment that we've made in healthcare to save people's lives. And I think for those of you in the healthcare industry that are out there, thank you. I know what you're capable of because I saw it. And what I wanted to do is talk to all of you about what I saw, what we need to be able to do so that we can find the deviations, the positive deviations, the negative deviations. So we can find out what is really happening to our patients and communities before they get into the hospital, even before they get to clinics. So what have I learned about pandemics? I've been working on pandemics for about 40 years, mostly HIV, TB and malaria. Pandemics are always political. No one wants a pandemic. No one wants a pandemic because Zika interferes with tourism. No one wants to tell you that they have a pandemic. No one wanted to tell you in the United States what family had TB. No one wanted to tell you what was going on with HIV. Because it induces fear in the community and when the community is fearful, we're irrational. And we make bad decisions. So what data can do is it can transform that decision making into transparent decision making that the communities can follow that people can understand. Pandemics always have misinformation. It was shocking to me that all of a sudden the media woke up and said, oh my gosh, there's misinformation out there about COVID. Do you remember HIV? How much misinformation was out there? How much these random cures that we're going to prevent you from dying of HIV when everybody was dying in the 80s, the random medicine that you could take overnight and just be immediately resolved of all HIV that you could go and sleep with a virgin and lose HIV. That was a big one in Africa. This misinformation is always common in pandemics. We know that. Yet 40 years later, we hadn't set up systems to combat that. We hadn't tapped into community organizations to get truth and information out in real timed individuals. So they wouldn't be afraid. They would know what was coming. They could make things predictable. We had a lot of theoretic plans. But in the United States as opposed to what we had done all around the world with HIV, TB and malaria, we had never implemented a pandemic plan. We just thought you would take that plan off that shelf and it would just happen. You would stand at a microphone and Atlanta or Washington and miraculously there would be a pandemic response. But pandemic responses are human behaviors. Yet, I will tell you in the 40 years of tracking vaccine hesitancy among adults for flu, we had done nothing. We reported on it every year. Every year we reported precisely who was not getting their flu shot. But we did not implement any behavioral research or any implementation change to actually improve that. Can you imagine having all those trucks broken down and not doing anything about it? Is measuring it, reporting it, talking about it in the MMWR? What I've learned in battling pandemics is political will matters. Because political will allows you to have the policies that change behavior and change access, the deal with equity. And the way you drive political will and policies is through data. You can't go into some place and say, I think it's this way. Not the data to follow that up. You can't go, you've got to get people to move past their own assumptions, their own perceptions with reality of what's happening in their community so that they can see it. So data needs to be visible, visible so people can act. And that's what we're missing. An Excel spreadsheet is not visible. Now I know there are people in here who can read an Excel spreadsheet perfectly. I've seen you. You're amazing. But most leaders, you had them a piece of paper with a 40 by 40 Excel Excel spreadsheet and it doesn't matter. You know, they need to see it. Political will and data allows us to see the individuals at risk. But more importantly, it defines the epidemic that you have, not the epidemic you want to have. If we've learned anything in watching COVID, there's a lot of political leaders that have a plan on the epidemic that they want to have. And you've got to give them the data to show us that's not the epidemic we have. It's not flu. It's not going to miraculously disappear. The pandemic is not over. You know, everybody wants to have these things change and it's our job to provide that data in clear forms, not in a way that we understand it but that others understand it. What does political will look like? Now this is a slide I developed five years ago. Just happens to be very relevant now also. There was a very different approach, very similar epidemics. If you look at the axes, about 35,000 new infections a year, but you can see Ukraine and Russia took a very different approach. What was that approach? Ukraine used data to realize who they weren't reaching. And instead of just keep doing things the same way they changed how they implemented their HIV prevention and treatment services to people who inject drugs. And it changed everything. They worked in the community and they worked with peers and they listened. And then they looked to see that they were having improvement. Now I've worked in the federal government a long time and let me tell you change management and the federal government is not for whims. You can't fire people. No one wants to change what they're doing on an everyday basis. And so if you need to do change management and what I saw in 2014 is we had made progress, but this was the world that we existed. And we had a disproportionate burden in Africa and we had to realign programs. And we had to take money from certain countries and give them to other countries. And we had to take money from certain communities and give it to other communities based on the data and who was at risk. No one likes that. But when you show people the data and clarity, then they can see it and they can act. And so we really move to this what you all do every day in business is accountability and transparency so that everybody could see that we're on a joint mission to drive outcomes and impact. Not theoretical, but reality. What are you doing? How far are you decreasing new infections? Did anyone die from HIV? What are you doing? Down to the site level where people are. People don't live in generic counties and states. They live in a specific house or a specific community and that's where they need to be reached. Now how did we use data? Well, it's a very interesting thing. Everybody knows I love data. And so I was at a cocktail party, World Aid, State 2015. And someone said to me, you know Debbie, everybody knows you love data, but I know a group that also loves data. And I was like, who? And they said, Palantir. And I'm like, who are they? And out of the like missed Julie Bush appeared. Whose birthday is today? And out of that mist of that moment of a cocktail party in Washington, DC, we started working together and making data more visible, data integration, data for use, data for action in sub-Saharan Africa. Integrating data on a daily basis so people could act and more importantly, could see that their actions translated in real change that helped people. So when we started doing this, this is, and it's really important that you integrate all your data sets. These are community-based surveys we put in the field to really understand. So we were doing great in finding people who were over 35. But if you were young, none of you knew your HIV status. You didn't care about your HIV status. It was not on your radar screen. It wasn't relevant to you. And so none of them were getting tested and none of them were getting treatment. So the entire epidemic had shifted to young people and that's where new infections were occurring. So what do we do about it? Well, we got more and more granular. Was it men and female? Yes. Was it all across all age groups from zero all the way up to 35? Yes. Was it worse in men? Yes. I learned a lot about male behaviors for health seeking behaviors. It's not good. All of you men in the audience. Volunteer helped us by going into Zambia, getting us great detailed data. Now this probably, this isn't me anything to you in your audience. It's just a visual that says to the government of Zambia and the people on the ground, you are losing more patients than you're adding to treatment. So for all the people that you find and get on treatment, you're losing more. So for every person on you added to ART law six, now it wasn't equal. You have maybe 400, 500 sites in Zambia. Some of them were retaining their patients. We could go out there and see what are you doing? Positive deviation to really understand people want something that works. They don't want a theoretic. Well Debbie said, I think this works. No, they want to say this clinic did these things and they retained patients. We did a lot. We have billions of data points. So we had to figure out how do you dissolve billions of data points into a place that people can understand it. I know you can't understand it by looking at this slide. But what it shows is who we specifically are missing. Why is this important? Because in the United States government, we have a habit of just saying, we're spending this much money across this many places rather than saying, okay, who are we really losing? We were losing particularly young women and young men between 15 and 24. So what are we doing for that? Getting resources from the areas and from the clinics and from the outreach of the older patients into outreach for younger patients. And so we were, this provided a lot of clarity. The thing was about men. We were losing men at all age groups except for the very old and the reason we weren't losing them is they were already quite sick with HIV. So they were personally motivated to stay in the clinic and continue. Well what happened? So we started this, we had a flat budget. We had a lot of money thanks to UX taxpayer dollars but it had been flat since 2009. And we had to get more people on treatment and more prevention services. So what did we have to do? We rearranged the entire program. We broke a lot of eggs but we made some beautiful, beautiful omelets. But this is what was important. New infections dropped by 70%. We had a lot of people who were in the hospital and we were just in that five year period of rearranging everything and we continued to decrease mortality. So we could see at a country level, we could see at an age group level, we could see that we were having impact. So fast forward they called me up in South Africa. I said no many times. Finally when America said we were going to screen people at airports by symptoms, that's I've got to come back. You're missing 85% of the cases if you're screening by symptoms. So I was like if this is what the United States is going to do and that tsunami wave is hitting both sides of the coast and that's what we're going to do. Americans are going to die. So I came back from South Africa in the March and this is what I had. Okay, in my first task force meeting, this was the data. So we had the cell spreadsheet. We had presumptive cases, confirmed cases, who was in the hospital, who was in home. You see there's no granularity. We don't know where these patients are. We don't know their age. We don't know their sex. So I immediately got on the phone and called my colleagues around the globe. And China immediately started sending me data, all analyzed. Who was at risk? Who was in the hospital? Who was dying? So I could immediately go, okay, case fatality rates, really bad if you're over 80. Not bad if you're young. And so this was extraordinary, helpful data. South Korea sent us the same kind of data set where I could see if you're aggressive with mitigation, how long does the surge actually last? It's a matter of weeks if you aggressively mitigate. They also sent me all of their data. Now you can see the cases they were testing. So they found the asymptomatic cases who were 20 to 29. So they had a huge number of cases in young people. No hospitalizations, no deaths. So we could see clearly there were people who didn't know they were infected, transmitting to others. And we could see clearly who was in the hospital and who was dying. Same thing came from Italy in addition to the comorbidities that Korea provided me. And in their midst of their own pandemic, they were sending me data every night. And I think that was, you know, when you're in a difficult situation and you're trying to get data, people sacrificing their own time, staying up the two or three o'clock in the morning, so that we could go out and tell Americans very early in March, who's it really at risk? Who's not, who's going to be symptom three, and what kind of comorbidities? And so on March 9th, I was able to say to the task force, I've integrated data from all of these countries, children and adults are underrepresented in cases, saying I said, either at pre-existing immunity, this is the actual slide I use, or they had subclinical or myocases. And that mortality was children and young adults were spared as opposite to flu and 1918 flu, but mortality was a super high in adults and it was nowhere close to flu. I then make a graphic for our task force that said, here are the green. There's essentially, you can look at those as our transmitters and this are the people who are going to do very poorly. Out of the blue, palantir, I called. And I said, you help me in Africa, I have no data. I need data streams. We don't have data streams. We've got to set all these data streams up, but we've got to be able to integrate them overnight. And so we were able to warn Americans, we were able to start mitigating, but we went from that simple sheet to a comprehensive data analysis with data streams from every state, every hospital, every laboratory within a matter of weeks. And that was the data that we used with Cardinal Health and McKesson, an Amerisers Spurgen, to completely rearrange the health supply chain. To send supplies only to those places that needed them. This was all happening behind the scenes, no one complained. I didn't have hospital data and I called the AHHA and I called you all and everybody said to me, the hospitals aren't going to give you data. I said, I need new emission data every single day by AH. They're like, they're not going to give it to you. I had 93% reporting that Friday. So the private sector will step up, they will help, they will give you what they need. If they know you're using it to help them. And so we used that data and we created these rearrangements of supply chains. But we created data that spoke to different groups and organizations. I brought some examples here every week, a total complete analysis due to the current state of the state. Every single governor, weekly got a report. This is what's happening in your state, county by county. We have over 3,200 counties. What's happening there? Who's being impacted? What you need to do? What's working other places? What is the new data about what's really helpful? And then there's a breakdown state by state. This is at the federal level. That pink and red are people over 70. That was the largest group that was admitted three years ago. It's the largest group admitted today. And over these last three years, 5% of Americans over 80 have died. So this continues to be a significant issue for people that are in the significant elderly. What I also wanted the White House to be able to see is that we were improving case fatality rates. Now early on, the case fatality rate for over 70s was about 30%. But you have to remember most of them are presenting at the hospital because we didn't have test. But with rendesaver, with improvement in clinical care, with what you did, and the resources you had, we were able to significantly drop that. And you can see each new tool from rendesaver to monoclonal antibodies. And by the time we left a year later, we were under 4%. But these are the kinds of graphics that are available. They're still up at HHS community profile. This is the work that people did in the middle of the night because they did this daily for me. And I would get it at 4 a.m. But if I wrote them and said it's missing this graph, someone answered me. So people in this audience and around the volunteer world that stayed up the three or four o'clock in the morning assembling this data, it was used, it was important. It changed how we responded to the pandemic. And it could change how we respond now. And so it was just not about cases, but it was about changing cases. So people could see it at glance. They're counting to understand what their county was doing with caseloads. And of course, this is during a very bad time, December to January of 2021. So you could not only see, you could see directionality, which I think is critically important. It's not just the number. It's how that number is moving, which direction is moving. And so this is what we sent to every governor, but they saw there's by state. This was available on our website, not that many people knew it was there because I couldn't really announce it. There were some restrictions. But we had hospital-new inpatients and everybody could see it. Now, just to finally close this out. The annual deaths of Americans, 250,000 Americans died last year from COVID. And those are acute COVID. That's not the long-term, or medium-term consequences of COVID. That's not the clotting disorders. That's not the depression and suicide from the brain fog. This is just acute-crow COVID. And so there is a lot of work that still needs to be done. And I want to show you this next two slides that we've got to stop politicizing and we have to use the data in real time. The difference between the red and blue lines are rural versus urban. It's not Democrats versus Republicans. It's rural versus urban. And as we develop tools, less tools got to the rural areas. Doesn't matter if it's vaccines, doesn't matter if it's PACs. Low bid, doesn't matter if it's monoclonal antibody. Their access was less. And so this mortality gap between Democrats and Republicans has been talked about now for over a decade. And we've done nothing. So if you live in a rural area, you're 20% more likely to die in an aged matched way than if you live in an urban area. Those of you who are privileged to live in urban areas will see an urgent care on every corner. What they have in rural areas is dollar stores. There's no primary care. There's less and less community hospitals. And we've known about it. And we've known about the poor health condition of every rural county. And we know people have had higher age adjusted rates for decades. Yet we measure, we don't act. And I want to leave you with really the concept that data matters. And the solutions exist. And we could do it tomorrow. And we can fix that truck and find it because it's carrying heavy weight. We can find the individual that lives 75 miles from the closest hospital, needs telehealth, and needs laboratory sense to their house in order to get access. We know how to do this. We have to have the political will. It doesn't cost more. It actually is cheaper. And we have to have data driving decision making. And that's what is possible today. Because if we don't treat every hospitalization and deaths as a programmatic failure on us and fix it, it's going to continue. And we've got to stop justifying and we have to start fixing. And that's the power of data. That's the power of data integration. And that's the power of making data understandable to leadership. And it's really the graphics that are generated and these alerts that are possible that we could all change. So thank you and I want to be able to take your questions. I have a couple of minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Don't be shy. You can ask anything. Medical, political. Thank you for hanging there. The hanging in there, which during a very challenging time. And you help so many Americans. So I just want to say thank you. Thank you. Well, it was all of us together. I can't tell you how much the private sector did. Today I was talking about health care. But they completely rearranged our food supply and moved all the commercial food into the grocery stores so that you had food. I mean, this was happening continuously behind the scenes. And I got and I was privileged to see it. And I got out to every state and I could see the level of the debtification from the governors to the private sector to the hospitals. And I wish every American could feel what I felt and see the innovation and ingenuity that has come out of this work. And I worry that we're turning the page and we're not going to really know how to implement in a pandemic because we're not codifying it. And the private sector is not at the table planning these pandemic responses. Yes, there's a question back there. So yes, really cool to see that the work you've done with all the data. So once you have the data and then the reports and all the compilations and all that, what were some of the most effective behavioral strategies you implemented based on that data? So the key was getting to the governors because the federal government is great. But really decision making and implementations at the state level. So getting that coalition is why we went out to the states. And so we took a model that we thought would work. That kept everything open and just talked about what happens with you using masking and indoor spaces and what happens when you make testing available to everybody. And taking that model out across the South in 2020 they agreed to implement it and they dramatically changed their rates of infection. And so giving people the tools and then the evidence base that it's working. So they could go out to the communities and say what you did made a difference. And I think that is really important. The way you encourage behavioral change is showing people the impact that their behaviors have. Not only for themselves and their family but their community at a large. Yes. So now you have a lot of data with you. What kind of predictions you guys are doing which can prevent us from future pandemics or any prediction on that so that we can be worried about? So here's the issue from my perspective. Parents should day should day should know if their child has RSV flu or COVID. And we have the technology to make that information known at the household level. That's the kind of things that we have to do. We have to put technology in the hands of families that then result in communities understanding what's happening. Imagine if you knew or as a business you knew that for the next four weeks flu was going to be really bad. We can tell you that today. We know now from the data that we've analyzed how to predict flu outbreaks and know precisely how many cases. We know that now. And we know that with COVID we can see the surge coming. I can see from what's happening in Europe what's going to happen here four weeks later. I mean it's very, this virus is very predictable. Yet every time we act surprised. Oh my god it's a new variant. Of course there were three new variants in the first six months that were causing major outbreaks. Of course we knew there were going to be new variants. It's an RNA virus. It makes mistakes. Fortunately we are DNA. So we make less mistakes. But even our replication makes mistakes. That's how we end up with cancers and other things. So an RNA virus makes a lot of mistakes. It's random. But it just happens every now and again to make a mistake that makes it much more transmissible. And so that was all predictable. We've seen it with HIV. We've seen it with other viruses. So it's really what's annoying to me is we're not translating that work into information in the hands of people. So that they can see that changes that they make make a difference. Right now we've lost all monoclonal antibodies. So if you have immunodeficiencies or if you have a super elderly person in your household who may not respond to the vaccine, we don't have a backup. There's just PECS Logan. So in the last three years instead of adding things and driving new technology and getting pharma to move with the virus, we stopped. And so this is really, this is how you don't respond to a pandemic and a virus that continues to mutate. I mean we know that with HIV, we made new HIV drugs. I mean I just, we have PECS Logan. What if we get resistance to PECS Logan? What is my 94 year old mother going to do? What is my nephew who was getting treated for Hodgkin's going to do? I mean, you know we know what the issues are and we have solutions yet we don't implement them. And I think that's the problem with us right now in pandemic preparedness. Is moving from the theoretical to full implementation, taking on something that we know is a problem. Take on opioids, take on obesity, take on diabetes. If you can change those rates through prevention and treatment services, you'll be ready for the next hand pandemic. You'll have relationships in the community. You would have built trust. They will know who you are. You will have talked in the churches, talked in the schools, talked to the future farmers of America. They will know their data and that trust will be established. That's how you battle pandemics. That's how we change the course of HIV community by community, county by county, country by country. Yes. How do we address not only the vaccine hesitancy, but the anti-vaxxers, which allow long dead diseases to crop up again, especially in schools and small communities? So you give anti-vaxxers ground by not being completely transparent. I'm just going to be frank. I mean, the difference between how South Korea handled COVID vaccines and we handled COVID vaccines. Because I've been on this soap box and so every country I go to, I'm like, well, you know that the protection from infection wanes very quickly, so you're not invincible and you could infect your grandmother. And I get to South Korea and I go to financial times and I'm like, you've got to report this and they're like, what are you talking about? We knew that. Our country from the beginning, our health officials said to us, this vaccine is going to protect the elderly, the immunodeficient, the people at severe risk from severe disease and hospitalization. It's not going to protect you from getting infected. So if you're worried about long COVID, if you're worried about medium COVID, if you're worried about your grandmother at home, you're still used to use mitigation. That's, you know, we've got, people can understand it. But we're not giving people all the information. We're not getting into the schools and churches. We're not communicating in a way where behavioral change actually makes a difference. And that's it, peer outreach person by person. And I know that sounds hard to do, but it's not because communities want information. And they want that knowledge in order to be empowered to do the right actions. And they'll do the right actions. I saw it over and over again in Sub-Saharan Africa. One final comment. Our health care delivery in rural areas and our tribal nations is worse than everything that I fixed in Africa. It's less. It's much less. So we have to do something about that in a very serious way. And we have to make the, what is very invisible to many of us, visible. Because I know if we make people visible, people will respond and help and do the right thing. And I think that's the way you control pandemics is getting into communities and working with them. But we have a lot to do here. And then finally, when I came back to the United States, we had less data available than I had for HIV. TBM Malaria in Africa. And so that is the state of affairs. And if we don't systemize and make that data available across the references, I don't want all your, I don't need all of your information. I need community acquired infectious disease that have been definitively diagnosed. I need a few codes. I don't need all your thousand codes. I don't want to take your hospital codes. I want the community acquired infectious disease so we know what our baseline looks like. So we can see when it changes. That's how you get alerts about a pandemic. Not a few surveillance sites. But all of our healthcare data united in us agreeing that these are the codes that make a difference. And having a system like a volunteer system that's able to constantly integrate that code, that's how those codes and tell you precisely what's going on in a data controlled way, that you're all confidence in where nobody's demographics can be seen. And that's what's possible today. That's what we didn't substitute in Africa. And if we want to be ready for the next pandemic, we need to do it here now. Thank you.
