TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Here in London, it's not London, it's my car with a new Hampshire. We've been doing business here, and we work very well here in a gas station, which comes to France to produce something we've launched. But first, you have to say that you're the only one who's going to be there. Hello everyone, my name is William. I'm a volunteer here in Palantin. But you're not here since when? I've been working here since four years. Do you think you've started to work here in Palantin? Because I wanted to work at the company that brings some values that are similar to mine. And who is the value here? The value of which? The value of which. It's in fact, being in the sense of using technology to influence, in a positive way, the life of people. And for me, it's always the mission of Palantin. It's how we can use technology to increase our capacity, to work better, to learn better decisions, to protect our freedom. And that's something I find quite unique. And if you, in my opinion, start to work in the background, it's necessary to do 10, maybe one year, to gain responsibility. When you start to work here, it takes a long time to get the possibility to do the real job here. Since I started, it's always been the case. There are a lot of spaces to be creative, to influence things. Everyone is confident to really work, to put things that we think are important. And it's not necessarily the case that I have in Palantin. And now we're going to learn a new program. It's three that, what says, three that, for the French, are the chiefs. Yes, the chiefs. Yes, the chiefs. For me, the chiefs. And I, without that, I work for you. And you can explain to me the things we want to do in France. And why? We have launched a program called Foundry for Builders, which is a program we are trying to help start-ups. But why do we need to help them? I think it's something important with Foundry and the startup. No, it's a very good question. In the thought that Foundry can help start-ups to accelerate their development. We are in the infrastructure of data that allows them to focus on things that are important, that are different, and use the platform to absorb all the complexity of the engineering of data. And that's why we want to implement this. It's a technology we developed since the last years, with actors who are all a little bit in the first place of industry. And we want to take this same technology and the implementation of the two actors. But to hope to become the platform... What do you think? It's a motor to make the integration of data, to protect data, and you can do what with Foundry? With Foundry, you're... And what do you think is really a technical technique? I've done some engineering studies, so I don't know if I'm a technical engineer. I like what I do, and I try to always be a little informed about what's happening tomorrow. But I'm not the one who develops the platform. Yes, but you can use it and understand how it works. How it works, what is it? So Foundry, is... If you explain that to someone, to you who wants to build a company in France, you can tell what? Well, it's a platform for data operation. It's a bit like an OS, a operating system, but for data. Like Microsoft, Polytroproind, Windows, Polytroproind, we're a bit like that, but for data. The idea is, if I was entrepreneur, if I had to build a product, or to spend a lot of time with my engineers, with my resources, which are very, very critical, because I really need to survive and go very, very quickly. The way to get these resources, to develop tools around the management of data that are not necessarily different for my business, well, I can use Foundry, and build my product on this platform. So, all the integration of data, all the transformation of these data, all the misadisposition of these data, can be managed in Foundry, and I can build things that are more rich. That's what I mean. If you want to build an enterprise, you can try to do that. You need a lot of free and a lot of time. If you can talk to us and have a few days talk to us, you can start with an enterprise. Exactly. We saw that the value of the company was really the speed, with which we can develop things on Foundry, and the same thing to learn from years ago, if we had to start with different types of tools, like Open Source or Off-Touch Rift. And I think it's a bit of a cut, because I know that there are a lot of people who are the people in France, and more intelligent, more interesting in the world. But we need a motor to make the enterprise faster, if not, as difficult as to make the competition. What do you say? Competition. With the competition, with perhaps American sportsmen who are doing the trick just now, and also a lot more people who already have a enterprise. But with that, we can do things at the same level. Yes. And why, Dr. Carr, do you think it's a good idea to work in France that it's a country that interests us in the Netherlands? Yes, it's true that we have a lot of work in France, we can have a very long time. And you know, I've studied and studied philosophy, and for me, I think for all people who have studied like that, and who think about the translation of European, French and French, it's not necessary to explain why French and French, but it's French. And if you look at the history of morality, of other things, it's impossible to think about a good history without thinking about the French. And I think that we can support the French. It's also the French, it's new for the entire country. Yes, I agree. Great. And so, Dr. Carr, you know that in the Netherlands, it's a partnership with Station F, which is a great supporter of Startup in France. It's one of the biggest in Europe. Why do you think it's... Well, why do we want to do that? You know, one of the things that is more like the French station, is that you can do the French station even if you don't do the studies, even if you don't do the studies that you have, even if your parents don't do the studies. In my opinion, it's more difficult to do that. And if you support the Interprises Startup in France, you also support the people who have been in the bad street, who have not done the studies like you, to the big circle. And also, to gain the possibility of doing the very important thing, and it's also very important for the future of France, that it's the kind of people who are there and you are the one in the possibility of even a new technique that is happening. And I can't do a lot of things to support that, but with the founder, we need to build a French school to help. Great. But we are very happy, and we are going to have to see what it will give. Thank you. Thank you.
