TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Last time Alex, the UNI talked, we were doing an interview for Axios on HBO. It was the depths of COVID and you were in an attic. A barn. Yeah. I will say it was a very nice barn. Yeah. So you're one of the greatest builders that's ever lived. I can tell you from personal experience that you're very generous to entrepreneurs who are coming behind. Once again, you were ahead, volunteer builds products for hybrid world. How would you say that what's happening globally? Global politics affect the businesses of every builder in this room. Well, first of all, it's a delay to be here and hopefully some of my relatives are watching the introduction because from their perspective, I'm a failed academic. Please watch. And then I would say, it's, you know, Pound tier is really a wee thing. And one of the reasons, I think main reasons America is outperforming in industry and especially in high tech industries, we actually work together in teams, which seems to be hard for other places to replicate. We built Pound tier on the assumption that the world was disjointed and violent and you had to prepare for a world where you would have a hybrid global but not completely globalized economy so you would need to be able to share but not with everyone. By the way, we built this for the Intel community and what typically people call civil liberties is nothing other than an architecture which allows you to share things selectively. You know, it's like we were building based on our conviction, we were motivating people based on our conviction, we attracted because of our conviction the very best partners. And I think one of the main reasons we did well was we were very focused on, you know, what Silicon Valley 1.0, what does Silicon Valley 1.0 do? It built things for the government that were valuable and then exported that know how technology to the rest of us which made us all happier, wealthier, better people and not focused on, you know, distributing division in the form of consumer internet which has left us all actually, emotionally poorer and gets you bad partners. You know, we got, we ended up first in the Intel community with I think a list of, you know, when we, when we depoed one of the critique, a critique of us was, well, you only have 100 clients and I would tell people, yeah, but look at the 100 of clients. They're part, by the way, I'd view them as partners. Yes, you know, yeah, we only have, you know, the best special operators in the world. We only have the best client-essend services in the world. We only have some of the best companies in the world. Yes, we're limited number of people that use parent-ger. And then we built a lot of products to quote, a shahm who's talking from, you know, from a kill chain to supply chain. I think it's a, you know, and, you know, and we built things all along the way and, you know, I'm very proud of that. And I am also very proud. If you look, America is a very unique, appears the outside world, hard to understand place that produces the most interesting entrepreneurs and companies and business people in the world are none. And to the extent we can support people like people in this room and others, it's a huge honor. So there's so much firepower in this room. I'm very quickly going to bring you into the conversation. You know, it's going to be a good conference when you walk in. I was getting my name tag. The first person you run into is Jack Oliver. So we're going to come to you for questions very first. But first, Alex, who do you think are going to be the winners and the losers in this new world you just described? We in America, both internally, like if you ask people a palager, how good is a palager? They'll be like, well, we do this. Well, we do that well. Yeah, the batshit crazy CEO is, his jokes aren't always funny. And we kind of underestimate what we have and what's special. And I would define it as an ability to build companies around an idea in a team culture where the innovation really has to be disruptive. We're very, very able in this country compared to any other country in the world to adapt. So for example, the palager or the IC products we were selling 10 years ago are not at all the same. And we first brought foundry to the market. People are like, well, dad integration. We built dad integration plus decision making that were powered. COVID distribution, vaccine distribution on the world and many of the businesses in this room. It was, you know, pretty outside the norm what we were saying. And then now it's like visibility to change and adapt and run your business based on new and different ideas and change leadership and build things and new or maintain the traditions that have gotten you to where you are plus innovate. So I think a very, very big winner in this is going to be industry in America to the point where it creates a lot of extra, extra nowadays. I spent a lot of my adult life in Germany and wrote my dissertation in German and very comfortable in the German speaking world especially in like out out of the monish in Lendershoff, south of southern Germany, Austria, Lieschensheim, West Switzerland. But it's, if you, you know, we are not smarter than they are. But in the end, you know, there is adaptation is the form of intelligence that matters and teamwork. So I think, I think the US market, US industry, US defense and allied defense is just going to massively outperform. But we are all, everyone in this room is a global economy and involvement of global economy. And that there are a lot of difficulties. We're looking at a Europe that probably will, you know, struggle over, you know, even as well, I think we come out of our difficult times maybe in a couple of years but they're going to struggle with tech adaptation, the tech scenes are just, you know, formally under a performance. And then you have, you know, wars soon to be big wars probably. And so, yeah, I think there are lots of opportunities but you have to be very adaptive. Soon to be big wars, what do you mean? Well, you know, we, I've been, you know, a palantir like our position was like seven, eight months ago we were warning that the Ukraine war would happen that it wouldn't be the consensus in America was it would happen but it would take two weeks, the consensus in Europe as it wasn't happened. And look, you know, the view that we were saying is it's going to happen, Ukrainians are going to do better than the Russians expect and then there's a real heavy, you know, chances of a war metastasizing are much greater than people. I think this has all become somewhat of a banality, was not a banality seven months ago. And the reason why I thought this was just, you know, you're, we've been involved in deploying disruptive pieces of software for almost 20 years and people, whether it's an industry or in governments, you know, typically historically software has been something you pay for and you hope at the end of the day you at least get a pleasant dinner but it is like isn't going to actually, and we've moved to being it, you know, it will provide some value to, in some cases I believe in our case it can transform your business or your military operation and, you know, Russia as an example, they spent $65 billion a year, we spent 800 but I think they assumed most a lot of percentage of our defense spending was not efficacious and they really underestimated the power of disruptive technology, especially software and that just creates, in these situations where you're disrupt and the other person isn't prepared for it, it creates dislocations. You think that nukes will be used before the war in Ukraine has over? You know, the question is the precise, when we were saying watch out for this, we need to be on top of this, people thought the odds were zero and that's why I was basically chased off a couple stages for saying it. I think there's a running 30% chance that we will see the use of nuclear weapons and then also I think the risks of something happened in Taiwan are much higher. How many years, what's your frame? I, we're, again, we're in the business of building software products, it happens that, but I, you know, I think it's a, I think in the next year or so it's quite dangerous. And so when you said, soon to be potential big wars, those were the two. Yeah, well our conflict, we have an ongoing, rather, in the open conflict with China, America has much more on top of this than many of our allies and then we have, you know, it's just, it's a, it look, the world that we thought we were getting 20 years ago where we all become happier and more peaceful, clearly, ain't happening. So just before we walked on stage, Alex Gordon, at least a Gordon should have said a headline just today, Putin said, the world faces the most dangerous decades since World War II. True? Obviously. And are you an optimist or a pessimist? Well, I mean, it is a definition. I think I, look, I, we, when you build software products, you try to build them based on the way the world is and the way to transform the world into a better place. And I don't think that's optimism or pessimism. I think that's transforminism. And that's what we should all be in the business of doing, whether it's our businesses or our country. And, you know, again, we, we are, we are, we collectively, those who are, you know, using our product as an art, we're trying to kind of build things that make our businesses, our institutions actually work. And to do that, you have to be both realistic about the challenges you have now and look forward and say, well, what are the challenges I'm going to have tomorrow and build against that? You say very bluntly something that very few founders or CEOs have the guts to say. And that is, you say American business should be more patriotic. Well, you know, it's funny. I wonder why like this, you would think this is controversial and it's a, most of the reason people were supplying us with the flames to warm our marshmallows on outside was simply because, you know, it's like we're taking a very obvious position, which is sure, we can talk about all the things that are, you know, we'd like to improve in America and there's a lot. It's a big, interesting country. It's been the most important culture since World War II by far, dominates the most important industries in the world, sure. But it is obvious that everyone in Silicon Valley is in Silicon Valley because something went right with America that's particularly helped us. And I don't know why it's controversial to want to support the US government, especially the US military, institution which, of course, has been involved in some things that I wouldn't, but in aggregate has made our society more integrated, fair, trained every part of our culture, been involved in making the world a safer, more decent place and protects us right now. And why that's controversial in Silicon Valley, I do not understand. Now, I believe I have somewhat of an advantage because I spent, you know, I kind of re-immigrated back to America. I spent a lot of my life abroad in very interesting places I learned a lot about, but I definitely made me appreciate coming back to America and being able to build a wondrous company, would not have been possible to build a volunteer or a company like us, any other place in the world. And that's just like an obvious banality. And, you know, I, you know, it's like if everybody in your insane asylum is insane and you're the one not insane person, which is how they viewed us, maybe it's hard to know if you're insane. I think it's like so obvious, but, you know, it's, you know, that's not the way Silicon Valley sees it in private, even though of course in public they hire people who say that's how they see it now because they realize that people thought, though, this community doesn't have the sense God gave a goat, like everyone's getting rich and you're not patriotic at all. While we're getting a microphone to you, I can ask one more question, so I'm going to bring you into the conversation just a signal. If you have a question while we're getting a microphone to you, Alex, you said something that surprises me and you said you rely on competition, you rely on your competitor. Well, we believe and we've proven with our, you know, our government product, which was built, is still the dominant product in the world for anti-terror, the kill chains that are products we built where the core architecture were built decades ago and then revitalized our ability to get products data from space to operators and then the foundry product which has played an enormous role in the last couple of years and in America arguably saved hundreds of thousands of lives during the pandemic and powers some of the more interesting businesses in the world. But these products objectively were very, very far ahead of their time and we're not the best at explaining why anyone would need them. However, you'll find people copying something that's right below our product, explaining to the world that you need this and then often failing at doing it and lo and behold, we're there. And we need those people to do it as annoying as it sometimes is, especially when it looks like kind of a copy. And that, it's like we, we often when you're doing something and you're making a big bet, you need people who maybe aren't as good at doing what you're doing but are much better at doing something else which is explaining the value of it and then we, you know, years later, that's how we got our dominant position in parts of the Intel community and we're getting that in defense and I believe in US commercial with partners. You're seeing just, you know, I don't have to, I know we're doing crazy well in the US and in Canada and that's why. That is wisdom. Okay, job up a hand if you have a question, we have a microphone right here. Yes, sir, right here. And please just say who you are and where you're from. Hi, my name is Rajesh Rao. I'm from Singapore. I'm working for a company called Timus. So Alex, my question is at a bigger pitch level about AI technologies. Do you think AI is an existential threat for human beings and what should we be thinking about in that perspective? Well, obviously as you know, when we say AI, we mean like we mean machine learning, machine learning and essentially autonomous thought. We're not at the last autonomous thought or, you know, there's many different definitions of that. What I think tends to be an existential threat for humanity and you see this in micro, micro situations currently is when one side either has a dominant hand or believes they have a dominant hand. You know, when you, I went to Stanford very, not very far from here and you basically learn, oh, you know, this is going to be regulated by the, you know, international norms. Yes, international norms work when people are at parity, like what we had post-World War 2. They don't work very well when one side has all the weapons and the other side has none. And so I think the primary threat to us is that there's somehow one side gets outside of parity, especially if that side isn't honestly the West. And so, you know, without going into the somewhat classified efforts that we support partly because no one else in the valley would, you know, it is crucial that the West stays at parity or ahead. There are different kinds of AI. So the US and the West are not focused and I believe, which good or not focused on internal surveillance. So China is the dominant player and internal surveillance in the world. We are focused on the hybrid of weapons, software systems and how they're used under what conditions and making those things more autonomous. And I believe that's absolutely crucial because in the theoretical world, yes, we wouldn't need them. And I don't think it's, it is, there is a danger involved in building any technology. But in the real world, it's going to be us or them who has them. And if we don't have them, then the norms of society will change and we won't be very happy with how they change. I'm going to come here next, but while you're getting the microphone to someone, I'll ask you quickly. Precept that you share with Axios is there's a lot of important innovation disruption going on in America outside the coast. Axios has started Axios local. We're now in 24 cities around the country, including Denver, where you moved your headquarters. What do you think is the important of the non-coastal innovation in America, the new next influence frontier? Well, you know, one of the things that just is a huge advantage to America is that we are the global leaders in tech. One of the things that has historically been a disadvantage is way too significantly over-distributed in a tiny corner of America. And you're seeing people both build new companies outside of Silicon Valley, move outside of Silicon Valley. And most people rejuvenate their companies with business-acumen, deep understanding of their markets, and products that come from all over America. But de facto, where the quality of the revenue doesn't move back to Silicon Valley, and that's the crucial thing. You do not want a society where all high-value revenue migrates to the Bay Area. And what we're seeing, what I think this room shows is the high-value revenue in your enterprise, meaning hybrid, software, hardware, business-acumen, distribution, does not in any way need to just be in Silicon Valley. I would say, again, what's anomalous is not the distribution across America where you have many centers of excellence in where you have economies the size of large countries that are one state. It's that this is an American phenomenon. And you would be hard-pressed, you know, we're a global company. I don't see this happening anywhere else. What have you learned by having your company headquartered in Denver? I mean, Colorado is a very seen place and place. I like going to work and not having, you know, yeah, I, you know, cost us extra money to roast the marshmallows, but I get, we get to say hi to people on the way, and I like it's very likable, very sane, things work, very pragmatic, and a lot of industry is smart people that also want to live in Colorado. That's great. Over here? Yes, sir? Oh, yes, sir. Cairo's aerospace. I think you were talking about how the world has changed. We've seen this departure from the norms, and we've seen it on like multiple dimensions. It's like the shocks of the pandemic, the rise of sort of new climate disasters, and the unraveling of the political order. And there's like this feeling of people wanting to like, can we just snap back to sort of normal and simpler times? But it seems like there's like two things happening. It's not just going to a more complex world, but a more complex world that isn't settling into some new like static state that maybe is a little more complex than it used to be. Instead we're in this sort of domain of dynamic complexity where everything keeps changing. And that's a challenge for software. Foundry's pretty well built for that as far as I can tell, but like do other companies understand the need to sort of have that agility to a changing world? Well again, I thank you former palanterian. Glad to see you're doing well. It's like the thing about macro trends that we believe a palanter is you either acknowledge they exist or you kind of get crushed. And so what I again think is very interesting and underestimated in America is Americans by and large are not super theological about this. And so you have the ability to adapt to a new world and see adaptation process that can actually make it better. Now the architecture of Foundry is one that allows you to work on hub and spoke so you can have a partially harmonic supply chain. You can move the supply chain around. You can do decisions against it is ideal for this. But the real value is taking that architecture and putting in the hands of people that know their business and are adapting to get ahead of these macro trends. And you just see a lot of that in this country and unfortunately less so in other places. And what I believe in what happened is America and hopefully with our help will adapt. And people will then three years later copy. We're about to get the hook. Yes sir go ahead. We'll get you a microphone. Yeah hi this is Nidiz Mitra from Panasonic. The micrush is more around digital transformation. A lot of buzzword, industrial 4.0 and all. What one caution you give us when we are doing this journey of digital transformation. One of the reason why we are here is that it becomes the part of the journey. So what is one caution or one risk you see most important is the biggest risk in digital transformation whether it's for a company or a country or a military is you have to actually have a more business view. Is this working? How is it going to get us there? How quickly does it take to get the iterations to work and the iterations have to move very very far away from the theory into actual reality. And what you see countries, militaries, companies getting into trouble it's like there's just take neutral examples. You have essentially ministry of rock and roll all over the world is called ministry of transformation. They're giving out billions of dollars to transform their institutions that creates an internal lobby of people saying that the power point is actually working. This is not a power point exercise. This is like your life is on the line whether it's your life as an individual or it's your life as a company. And if you don't figure this out the person next to you will and they will slaughter you. And you can't be you know handing power points back and forth whether people are being paid. And this is by the way more of a risk in big governments. It's like well why do so many of these things fail? Why was the assessment of Russia so wrong on Ukraine? Why do so many large programs across the West not work? It's because there's a multi billion dollar or in companies multi hundred million dollar project that is passing back and forth things that on paper should work. But someone asked they ask the question well do they work and by the way work what does work mean? Work is actually transformational. It's not churning your data pool and being able to write something about what you wrote about and how you wrote it. It's not doing a project that only two people in your company understand. How do we take the business and move it from here to here in a very short period of time? By the way time if you want to make sure this isn't happening in your business take the timelines cut them in half or divide them by five. And like you want transformation goals that fail but at a high level so it's like oh you need two years to this great. I want to see it done in two months. This will surface all the problems. And you see one of the reasons special operators or special operators is because the timelines are tight the budgets are actually thinner. You know special operations communities operate with less money and less time and more constraints and then compare the output to everyone else. And that's how you have to do it. That moves it from theory to practice to honesty. And then as a last addendum I think one another thing that has really worked in America works better than other places is just being honest about okay yes we thought this was going to work it's not working. It's like it's super hard to do that and you know it just says we had we filled a number of products. We had a product we built that was a failure. It's like but it's okay you just have to kind of acknowledge it. It's really hard but that's obviously crucial. Budget action bull wisdom too quick to go questions one you're thinking about communication our guests here today will be getting a new Axios book smart brevity. It's the secret sauce of everything we've learned in 15 years of building media companies. We started Polico we started Axios how to communicate more efficiently powerfully. At the time we're working from everywhere and when the generation coming up really cares about higher purpose mission. There's a company down the road that has a thousand PR people and yet everyone's curious about Palantir why. Because we deliver we don't waste our time hiring PR people and then the people we talked you that know something about actually know something about but it's yeah it's like you know it's really everybody in the world knows Palantir. Now if you go to the French subway you might see death to Palantir and I'm okay for that with that we have we have strong opinions we do not shy away from them. When the lawyers come and tell me I can't articulate them that's nice to hear and they by the way every year there's no reason we need funds in the beginning we don't have any clients we don't have any money then it became oh we're a real company now we we have a billion dollars you know in revenue first half a year a billion dollars in a million all these milestones now we can't tell the truth we are honest about what we think we we do not get involved in every issue but if involves anti-terror or we're honest and not everyone likes that and by the way that's important they can't have an opinion if everyone agrees with you going back to those early days what premium did you place what is your view of internal communication communication to your teams your leaders well first of all there's a selection element and you know when you hear question you know of course it's the right thing to say we but it's actually true you have the senior like most of the people who run Palantir there are a number of them here you have like Cham and Ted all sorts of others we have our leader of Apollo over you these people have been at Palantir for you know a very very long time and believe me I pissed them off sometimes and almost consistently told them things they did not believe were true however I avoid lying to people internally like my life is on it and do not lie you don't have to answer the question don't lie we forgive mistakes we don't forgive lying treacherous behavior and the like and we do I know people you misuse this mission word but we are believers and if you want to build a company you need belief and you need truth and then you actually have to swallow the pain of you know the fact the person you're working with and noise hell out of you and deliver just assume positive intent Axios always ends with one fun thing I have the title for your fitness book something you were saying before we walked out run like a snail what do you mean by that oh yeah so I like most rational people I'm a cross country skier and and the cross country skiing is dominated by Norway and there are lots of reasons but it's like completely dominated by Norway it's like American football and like we actually American women are quite good but de facto it's it's Norwegian and there are many reasons obviously technical growing up and snow but the primary reason is Norwegians run like snails hours and hours a week literally and do intervals twice a week one at least two to three intervals are below lactate threshold and so it's completely counterintuitive it's not that you're running faster all the time you're running very very slow and occasionally very fast and if you do that for three years you end up with a extraordinarily high cardio base has your buddy fat very low Alex Carp thank you for founder con and thank you for the conversation thank you so much for your time
