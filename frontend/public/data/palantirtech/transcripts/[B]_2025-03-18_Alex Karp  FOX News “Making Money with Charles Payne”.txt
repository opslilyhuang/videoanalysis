TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Investors are hoping to come to the rescue, including Palantir. Palantir, by the way, hosting at 6Ainho, API, Seacon, showcasing its AI platform and growing business partnerships, including a deal with Archer Aviation. Joining me now, Palantir, Co-Founder, and CEO Alex Carp. Alex, I want to just tell you, I got an Alex Carp bandwagon late last year, but I'm glad I'm on it. You are absolutely phenomenal. Let's just start with today's event. You get a chance to strut you stuff. You're showing new tools, new capabilities, and a string of deals. Talk to us about that. Well, first of all, a mutual fan. I'm very, very happy to be on your show, and hope to see you in person. Yet, look, we've spent the last, especially last five, six years, being told we couldn't talk about how AI was going to transform the world. We couldn't talk about later, large language models, being a commodity that needed to be powered by software. We couldn't talk about the superiority of the West. We couldn't support our lethal institutions. I wasn't allowed to speak in public. Everybody thought that she'd get rid of me. And you know, it's like part of what we're doing is showing off what we're doing with our partners who are among the very, very best in the world. Part of what we're doing is saying, look, this is how we want. If you want to win, this is what you do. We're in a unique phase of Palantir, because there's just a lot of people that realize we were right, and we have all this infrastructure. So people have tried large language models because various people, if I mean Silicon Valley's done an amazing job, first it convinced the world we should build Wates, Wasteful, Carcinogenic Apps, then it convinced the world we shouldn't be pro-America, then it convinced the world, large language models, which are a great scientific experiment are valuable. Meanwhile, we're modestly sitting here saying, yeah, that pooling doesn't work, those views don't work. Your country will fall apart, your enterprise won't work, or you can buy Palantir's very fairly priced off or end win. And that's what I mean, it's like, at this point, we have an avalanche of demand, especially in the US. What is concerning for the world is the avalanche of demand, and what we're seeing in the US is at least as of last year, last year, a US commercial group roughly 54%, and European, continental Europe grew 4%. So this is a tale of two cities. I really hope that at some point Europe gets off the, if we don't build it, we can't buy it, bandwagon a failure. But one of the trends that I see is that there's like, people assume that there's a pendulum and it'll swing back, whether that's the Democratic Party or that's European tech. And I believe there's a pendulum that's swinging hard and hard and faster and it's not going to swing back. And our partners believe it, which is why they're just buying our product. You know, Alex is interesting, you say, because your stock has become something of a proxy for that debate you just talked about, that sort of debate that you talk about. And obviously, it's been under a little bit of pressure now. I watched really closely last week, that stock have made a really big rebound, and then that evening, Mungo posted their results, wondering their highly profitable contracts, apparently with the government won't be renewed, right? So those out there, that same day, they showed the wasteful spending at HUD and just how crazy it was. So now the speculation is that those will have a negative impact on Palantir, although fans of yours company, who loved your company long before I did, tell me no, this actually is a positive for Palantir. Well, look at Palantir, we're very focused on what will make the West superior in the commercial space mainly here on the battlefield. So even if it were for Palantir, I think bad for Palantir, I'd be in favor of it. I mean, but I, you know, I mean, how often if critics of Palantir have been right, and it's like, look, making buying, if you want to reform an institution, whether it's commercial or government or anything, what is the first thing you're gonna do? Change in an economics, make the customer experience better. How are you gonna do that realistically in the West? You're gonna buy the best software and implement it. Who are you gonna buy from? So I mean, like, and I love that we have all these skeptics that you can keep on. Skeptics is annoying as they are. Yeah, you know, just come out and tell the venture community about how much we're gonna fail. It's like, but for the somewhat idiotic skeptics of Palantir, we would probably be competing with 50 companies. So please amplify your skepticism. Palantir is very prodoge. I'm prodoge. I believe it's gonna be great for America and I'm supportive of it. And, you know, read into that what you will. Right. But, you know, America's gonna become more lethal, more economically strong, and we're participating in that and we're thrilled. And again, on the non-doge front, does anyone doubt we're doing well in US commercial? I mean, all these same skeptics are like, it's like completely ridiculous. Somebody's got it for these skeptics. You're like, oh, Palantir is a service company. They'll never, Palantir will never have a commercial product. Oh, Palantir will win, but it's only with one administration. Oh, Palantir's got the best product, but Carp's too crazy. Or Palantir would just shut up about the West being superior, their sales would go up. It's like, at what point is there a scorecard? Like, and again, I would encourage people in every institution we want to reform. What did the person say, how often were they right? How are they doing? And you've got a heavily index against that. But again, no matter what you think about what's happening in the US government, I'm supportive of it. You know, look at what we're doing in commercial. Can you even open the newspaper and not see one of the greatest companies in the world in America partnering with Palantir? It's crazy. And I've never seen anything like this in the last 20 years being involved. And honestly, the part I love is that we're winning. The part I love almost more is that we're getting to do our usual humiliate the critics of Palantir. And it makes my life a lot of fun. I love when you humiliate the critics. I built my entire career being contrarian. You know, I wouldn't have even started my own research business if I thought Wall Street was doing it right. And then by the way, they never changed because they're too elitist to change. You've referenced the business, the US supremacy, the West. And this is all sort of all part and parcel of your new book, which by the way, number one in New York Times bestseller list. I just took some points out of the letter, your most recent letter, because it sort of matches what's in the book. And I just want to bring this to you. So one line that really is amazing. The unfortunate thing either in business or politics is that many of one's adversaries and antagonists will never respond to anything but strength. It feels like you're not only talking about business, but also what's happening with America right now. And maybe the Trump administration and what some see as a heavy hand in this toward the rest of the world, but maybe that's the only thing they'll respond to. Look, there are people who believe that strength works and there are people who work in the Berkeley faculty. And you know, it's like so obviously true. And it's the only thing that works. Everything is self, everything else is some form of intellectual self-pleasuring. America is the greatest experiment, the greatest country that has existed. And we must support it and make sure the inside and outside meaning the internal economy and the defense of it are the world's best. And Pouchers role in that is something that makes me super proud. And the fact that the book is still going well. Let me just ask you. I want to jump in here because the clock is ticking on me a little bit here. You're pretty the size of about the different cultures out there, Western culture in particular, perhaps saving it. You've already set to Europe out loud here. You hope they wake up, they get their sort of epiphany. There's another line from the letter. As Sam Huntington has written, the rise of the West was not made possible quote by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion, but rather by its superiority and applying organized violence. Again, I love it. I think it's straightforward. Do you take key for this sort of thing? But is it something that we have to come to grips with? Is this adult thinking? Well, it's a thinking of a culture that wants to thrive and survive pays attention to the basic reason people are listening. America's ability to organize violence in a superior way. And then use it in a much more moral way than any other country would given its ability to do this is the single reason why the world improved over the last 70, 80 years. And then there's again a commercial version of this is like if your company is not able to produce the best product in the most expedient way, you also, people are not going to listen to your marketing. One of the biggest problems that institutions have is they're like, well, this is a marketing problem. No, it's an underlying fundamentals problem. Your marketing can be pretty damn bad if your fundamentals are great witness, pounders, rice. And so on the government side, it's about having superior organization and implementation and moral, and by the way, there's a moral good to how do you do it of violence as Samuel Huntington said. And on the business side, it's is your business to monster really superior? Is your product superior for the customer? Is it superior for your investor? Meaning it's the best product in absolute terms and it's being produced in the absolute most efficient way inside your company. And people who want to have a big stick and talk quietly will be very focused on the internal dynamics. Those that want to have a loud, loud speaker and have everyone ignore them will focus on some kind of marketing that isn't working anymore. And witness institutions that are failing, whether it's Europe's failure or the Democratic party, you can look at all these things, they're failing for various very simple reasons, which is no one believes the underlying dynamics of what they're saying is gonna create more value than what you put into the actual instrument. And that's a very basic business principle, but it's also the principle by which nations survive and thrive or disappear. Alex, thank you very much. I do hope to meet you really soon in person again. You've jumped really high on my list of heroes and Americans to buy that book, pay attention to it because the cross currents between business and this race for survival and American exceptionalism is real. Thank you so much, appreciate it. Thank you.
