Good evening. Excited to be here, excited for our partnership with Palantir. And appreciate the opportunity to come and speak to you all and tell you a little bit about what we've been creating at Healthpeak. Before I get into that, let me tell you a little bit about our company. Healthpeak is a real estate investment company. We own and operate over 700 facilities across the United States, spanning life science, outpatient medical care and senior housing. Every day, hundreds of thousands of people go inside our facilities. It's nurses, it's patients, it's researchers. They're running clinical operations. They're doing life-saving research. They're delivering patient care. And our mission at Healthpeak is to make sure that we're the real estate partner of choice for all of these health care firms. Probably 18 to 24 months ago, we sat around at Healthpeak and realized we had a problem. We realized that technology wasn't enhancing what we were doing. Technology was holding us back. And so we asked ourselves a zero way where we could utilize technology to build the best real estate investment management platform and further our mission to be the real estate partner of choice. We quickly realized to do that, we had to get our employees out from behind computer screens and out in front of our partners and our tenants. When we decided where we were going to engage with Pound here, we knew it had to be somewhere where we could improve a workflow that would make a real immediate difference. And so we chose accounting. I know accounting isn't the most exciting workflow you could choose, but I knew if we could nail accounting, we could probably literally do anything. And so we decided to dig in. And it's funny when we dug in, we realized it wasn't just our accountants in corporate offices doing accounting work. Accounting was literally taking time for everybody, including the people in the front lines, our property managers. Our property managers live at the properties. That's where they do their day to day. And instead of being out serving those clinicians, serving our tenants, they were stuck behind computer screens doing accounting. And so we realized that was something we had to fix. We've gone through a lot of different processes that we've improved, but I want to give you one example of something that we improved just recently. Every single month that helped be across our 700 properties, we have thousands of sub meters that are generating data for us, you know, recording how much energy utilization is going on in each suite. And every single month, our property managers have to take that data and they have to go take pictures of it and they have to upload it into a spreadsheet and they have to do calculations. They have to send it to accounting. They have comments. It comes back. It takes hours and hours of our property managers time. It takes them away from our tenants and puts them behind a computer screen. We knew we needed to figure out how to fix it. So I want to go just a little behind the scenes and show you what we built. When we ultimately stepped back, we knew all you really needed to do was take a picture of a sub meter. And if we could get that sub meter picture into some information, we could do the whole process automatically. We didn't need all these people doing all these things sending spreadsheets back and forth doing calculations. We could have AIP in our ontology do the entire process. Obviously flagging instances where there are issues or concerns. I want to jump into one of where we notice an issue. You can see this is basically just a picture of a sub meter. It's a utility bill and a lot of different items that the AIP is checking regarding the matching of those two items. The system knows everything. It knows how to apply the correct methodology. It knows how to get the correct dates and rates. It calculates the tenant's share of the expense. It creates the invoice. It runs it through accounting. It compares it to historical and projected amounts. And ultimately it saves us a ton of time because instead of a property manager going through all these individual items, they're only looking at the things that were flagged. So they can get out from behind the desk and back in front of our tenants. That's been super exciting. We're very excited about what we're building in accounting, but honestly we're more excited about what we're doing in 2026. This is where I think the platform can really come to life. Accounting was a building block. It provided the foundation of what we're trying to build. But the next step is to really create an operating system that connects everything in our company. Our people, our buildings, our data. And to do that, we knew one of the things that we would have to do was go mobile. We decided that we needed to build an app to give our property managers and our team access to our ontology and our operating system wherever they are whenever they need it. I want to walk you through one example of something we're building. Every day across all of our buildings, there's thousands and thousands of interactions happening. Our tenants are speaking with our property managers. They're having conversations about the quality of the space, about what they're trying to do. Sometimes it's complaints. And we asked ourselves how do we capture all of that information? And so what we have here is basically our property manager going into a conversation and saying, hey, I just talked to the tenant. They have a big need. They need some new people. They're hiring a lot of people. And by the way, it's pretty hot in their office. We might need to adjust the AC. At that moment, our property manager doesn't have to go into some legacy CRM system. They don't have to jot it down in an notebook. They can literally just grab their phone, record a message, and it starts a chain reaction. This is what we're excited about. So at that moment, after they recorded, it connects all the dots. And it not only records the note, it activates the process. The first one is to our leasing team. We're not waiting for our tenants to tell us they need more space. The system is actively monitoring our ontology, looking for key instances that could indicate a tenant in our partners need more space. In this case, more employees means more space. The system then looks at their current footprint. It analyzes their growth pattern. It looks at what's available in our buildings. And surfaces logical next steps that are fed to the team that they can then go act on. The second one was for the facilities. The separate action. The room was hot. Notwithstanding the thermostat being wrong. The system can look at the HVAC history for that suite. It can identify whether there's been similar issues in the past. And it can read the information to determine the likely root cause and next step. For us, that's real leverage. It's the best people in the best buildings now supported by a system to amplify their impact and the performance. Exciting part now, we have the information. Our engineers diagnosed the issues. We can use our operating system to create real leverage. Not only can we look at that unit or that HVAC unit, we can look at every maintenance ticket across our company. We can look at energy consumption data. The age and warranty status of the equipment. And critically, because going back to the accounting piece, now we can look at all the costs we've incurred over time. We're able to then leverage our entire scale and start making capital allocation decisions informed by operational intelligence. We can create a future where every repair, every maintenance, every dollar spent across our entire portfolio can be informed and it can help us deploy our capital better. The kind of operating model that we're building toward is unique. It's a platform that will learn from every interaction and it raises the performance of everything we're doing and ultimately gets back to our goal of delivering the best tenant experience for our partners. Through the automation, the nuance captured in this one phone call, this one interaction generates a series of activities that they're active on. We're not waiting anymore for somebody to jot it down and to make sure it gets done. One simple conversation driving real measurable results across the organization. As our portfolio grows, we're no longer limited by the number of people we have. We're now just limited by the technology. We can grow our portfolio without adding any incremental cost. For us, that's very big. We're excited to have shown this to you guys today. We're excited about the transformation we're making to help peak. We have an installation there in the back. We'd invite you to come join us and check it out when we're done. Thank you.
