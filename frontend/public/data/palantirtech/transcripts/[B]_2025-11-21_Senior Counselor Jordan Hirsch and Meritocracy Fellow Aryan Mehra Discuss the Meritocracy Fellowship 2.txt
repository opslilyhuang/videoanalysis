I decided to bring you this story. Tech giant palantir shaking up options for graduates with a meritocracy fellowship. As the Wall Street Journal lays it out, Palantir thinks college might be a waste so it's hiring high school grads. I'm gonna bring in Palantir, Senior Counselor, Jordan Hirsch, and current meritocracy fellow, Aryan Mera. And Fox News is currently working with Palantir on AI tools, which is very exciting as well. Let me start with you, Jordan. What is the fellowship? I know it ends this Friday or maybe ends today. What is the fellowship? And why is it good for young people like him? Yeah, Dan, thanks for having us on. We launched this fellowship because we felt like colleges were not doing their job in selecting for and promoting students on the basis of meritocracy. Meaning on the basis of their effort and focus and the results of their work. And that became a problem because they elevated other values. And we think meritocracy is the key to American success. It's really part of the American success story. And we wanted to bring it back through the lens of Palantir. Okay, so Aryan, I want you to look at this. Because I think you're in this category, right? Number one on screen. The question was, how do you value college education 15 years ago? 75% said it was very important. Wow, look at this. This year's 35%. Are you in that 35% category? I mean, do you think it's important or do you think you found a different option? I think it's exactly what Jordan said. Colleges are no longer the most prime place of meritocracy. And if you're looking to be around a place of smart, ambitious, talented people, then perhaps college is not the place for you. And Palantir has created a very strong alternative to that. That's very appealing to people who, at a young age, want to be surrounded by ambitious people and accelerate that. So tell us about your experience. What did you love the most? Yeah, I mean, we obviously had the first month where we had seminars learning about the West, the history of the West. And then after that, we went into projects on actual impulse and Palantir. So I've been working in hospitals more recently being doing some work in children's hospitals with patient access. And we're treated exactly like real employees there. We get the responsibility of real employees. We talk to the executives of the company. We spend hours upon end of rooms alone with these guys and we're given the responsibility to succeed. And that faith in us is on the spot. Yeah, what's interesting about that is that when I talk to young people, high school of college, I would say pick a path. You can deviate anytime you want. But if you pick a path, you're going to be years ahead of your peers. You are lucky enough to know the path that you want and you've picked your path. So now I'm wondering, you continue along this line of teaching, right? Mm-hmm. And had you gone to college? Would you have been behind? I would have been behind. If you think about it, after graduating college in four years, people at Palantir who have done this fellowship, if they say they'll have four years of experience, it's like an eight-year gap. And you know that time just allows you to learn so much more, so it allows you to experiment within Palantir as well. There's such a broad variety of things you can do. Just having that head start is being so important. Yeah, you leap frog. Alex Carp is a co-founder and CEO of Palantir. He said this, that if you did not go to school or you went to a school that's not great or you went to Harvard or Princeton or Yale, once you come to Palantir, you're a Palantirian? No one cares about the other stuff. This is by far the best credential in tech. If you come to Palantir, your career is set. How competitive is it for Palantir to try to find the best talent in America? Well, we think we're a magnet for talent because we think like Aryan, people understand that if you want to be with the best, you want to be surrounded by the best, to have the best brought out from you, Palantir, is the place to go. And it's really incredible. We are floored by what these 18-year-old fellows did at Palantir. They are contributing, like Aryan said, right alongside our tenured software engineers to customer outcomes that are worth a lot to our customers in value. And that's really special. We put aptitude above skill and experience. And I think that's going to attract a lot of people who want a shot and don't want it to be based on pedigree or social issues or class. Why is a course on Western civilization important? Yeah, well, we think if you know the why, you know the how. It's very important to understand the ideas that animate the West to build the software that defends it. That is really the motto of this program. And so we want people to understand, we talk about defending the West, which we do all the time. What does that actually mean? What are we fighting for? And that's why we did the first four weeks of the program, giving people a sense of what is this culture? What is your birthright as an American? And what are you doing when you go build software every day and you're working long hours into the night as the fellows often do? Well, it's super exciting. And exciting for our viewers to hear about young people like you and your very exceedingly bright future, whether you're at Palantir or somewhere else. Thanks for all you do. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you.
