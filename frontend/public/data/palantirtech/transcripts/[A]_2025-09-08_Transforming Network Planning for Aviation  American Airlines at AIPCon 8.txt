TRANSCRIPT

Please welcome from American Airlines 
vice president of operations strategic planning and performance an Moroni 
and director operations schedule and block planning Amit Shindai. Good morning. Um so I hope your journey here was smooth and 
I hope if you flew that it was on American Airlines. So thank you for your business. Um my 
name is Ann Moroni. I'm the vice president of operations planning and performance at American 
and I'm here with my colleague Amit Chandai who's our director of operation strategic planning. 
Our team's mission to put it simply is to build the best possible plan for the airline that will 
support our incredibly competitive network and deliver reliably, efficiently, and safely for 
you, our customers every day. Um, so with that, we're really excited to talk to you about our 
partnership with Palunteer today and what we've been starting to do with Foundry and how we 
transform the way that we actually build our network. So nearly a hundred years of innovation 
at American Airlines and it's led us to be the largest um airline in the world carrying the most 
passengers and operating the most flight than any other airlines. 630,000 customers will fly on 
us today. To put it in perspective, that's 220 million passengers a year. 6,500 flights, that's 
about five times the size of the entire London Heathrow operation will be operated today on 
American. And we do this with a phenomenal team. Um over 14,000 pilots, 24,000 flight attendants, 
35,000 airport employees, and 6,000 mechanics who will work 247 365 to run the operation safely. So, 
our planning um bear with me for a minute. Imagine you're at a gate ready to board your flight. For 
that moment to happen, the planning has started long in the making to ensure that that aircraft 
is at that gate with the right crew with fueling, catering, servicing on board, baggage and 
cargo loaded, the flight plan ready to go, security checks done, and the ground crew and 
ground equipment ready to push your aircraft. That planning starts month in advance and we'll 
go all the way to the day of operation where an integrated operation center will actually dispatch 
your flight. It's an incredibly complex logistical problem and um and unfortunately as you can 
imagine many of of you in the room can relate our current planning is incredibly um manual 
uh incredibly sequential and unfortunately as a result quite siloed. So from outdated UIs like 
you can see on the screen, Excel spreadsheets, attachments being sent via emails between teams, 
we spend an inordinate amount of time trying to actually build the best schedule we can. We rely 
on expert planners to weigh thousands of different variables and look at many different data points 
to find the balance between profitability and reliability. And as you can imagine, it doesn't 
leave a whole lot of room for optimization. Now our schedule build starts at the core of 
it with demand. Making sure that our network is the most competitive and can be to serve 
our customers needs. But obviously a lot of operational constraints need to factor in. 
Fleet is a big part of it. Pilot hours, gate and infrastructure, airspace conraint 
constraint, the time we need on the ground to maintain our aircraft and to turn our aircraft 
at the airport. All of that is built by our network planning team into a first version of a 
schedule that will then be sent over to all of our operational teams who will then provide feedback, 
but also build their own plans, workforce plan, workload plan, material plan, ground equipment 
plan, and you name it. Unfortunately, by the time a team finds an opportunity in the 
schedule, it is often too late to build in their original plan or the solution they have in mind 
works great for them but does not actually work for the enterprise. Fixing a crew issue could 
actually cause a maintenance issue if it's not thought through the right way. We have to solve 
earlier in the process as a network and we have to solve on a continuous basis. Time is against 
us when we do this. Of course, the world changes as we build those schedules. Things change and we 
need to be dynamic and competitive to respond to the market demands. So, we set out to partner with 
Palunteer to completely redesign this workflow and rethink the way that we do business. And it's 
been an incredible journey. In just about a year, we've already unlocked millions, tens of millions 
of dollar value. Um the idea here is to actually collect all of this data and integrate the 
workflows between network planning and operations planning and really unlock efficiencies that 
otherwise would not have even been visible to our people. The goal again here in what we've been 
building is to do this continuously dynamically because the world keeps evolving. So with that 
I'm going to pass it to Amit who's going to take you a little deeper into what we've built. 
Thank you an good morning everyone. So for the next five minutes, I want you to imagine 
that you're the world's best airline scheduler, right? There's a very simple homework problem in 
front of us. We need to look at that incredibly complex chart that Ant showed and we need to find 
all the inefficient patterns in it and we need to provide solutions from those patterns uh that 
helps us operate a safe uh schedule, a reliable schedule for our customers and most importantly a 
profitable schedule as well. So what's an example of a uh inefficient pattern right? So consider 
this example uh I have a flight that is coming into San Francisco tonight and there's a flight 
departing early morning from San Francisco. Those flight timings just are tight enough where the 
same crew doesn't have adequate amount of rest in between and so the same crew cannot operate the 
flight that came in and they cannot operate the flight that goes out. As a consequence, that crew 
has to sit in San Francisco or be a lovely city um for an extra day and we have to ferry in 
another crew to operate the next day's flight. That's a highly inefficient pattern, right? And 
we have thousands and thousands of these embedded and hidden in the schedules that we need to go 
find. Over the last year or so, uh we've been on a journey with Palunteer to try and reimagine our 
workflows on how do we effectively identify these issues, how do we localize where those issues 
are happening and how do we actually fix them. So there's a lot going on on the screen that this is 
a solution we call vector. Uh it's it's obviously built on Foundry otherwise they wouldn't be here. 
um uh but it shows us sort of the the critical information right like these are key performance 
indicators at the top uh but there's something really interesting that is happening on the left 
hand side of your screen right so if you look at the crew advisor uh module you will realize that 
instead of us having to go hunt and peck where these inefficiencies are those are actually being 
surfaced to me right so these are recommendations that the models are scanning the entire network on 
and they're saying there's there's something that I found you probably want to take a look at it. 
So, let's let's go a little bit deeper into this. As I'm sort of going in a layer deeper, uh 
what I see is that it's recommending that my San Francisco flight needs to be rettimed by 
15 minutes, right? And you would think like, okay, that's a really simple thing. 
like what's the big deal in that right um you should be doing that in any case problem is 
this happens to be a notoriously difficult problem uh that one flight ret time is going to 
trigger a whole bunch of upstreams and downstream constraints that now come into 
conflict and I need a mechanism where I'm starting to think through all of these different 
possibilities as I work through the schedule to help us with this there are models that are 
integrated in the background that provide live checks for me, right? And these checks are 
looking at am I creating a gating issue? Am I creating a turn issue? Am I violating any of my 
standards? Am I violating any of my site barriers? And those models are running continuously in the 
background. Right? The the end result of this is I'm going to come into this and you will realize 
that it's actually identified a conflict for me. So that 15-minute read time even if I implement 
it the models are now saying that hey you have a problem you need to go resolve this through some 
other mechanism and in this case instead of just dumping that problem in my lab vector is smart 
enough where it is actually going in and looking at what are the other possible ways through 
which you can solve out of this issue and in this case it's looking at some models these are 
optimization models that are saying if you just flow your lines a little bit differently you have 
a really good solution right so that's what we are going to do. We're not done yet though, right? So 
from a customer's experience, um we need to make sure that any solutions, any augmentations of the 
schedule can operate not just on beautiful blue sky days that we see here in California most of 
the times, but also on gray sky days, right? When there are thunderstorms uh that are happening. So 
we have integrated network simulation models in the background that are constantly stressing 
our network. They're stressing our schedules and they're trying to evaluate where are the 
choke points, where are the break points in the network. So as you can see on the screen, uh 
it had identified a potential problem and at the same time if you if you follow the pattern here, 
it's also going to make recommendations on other edits that I need to do so that I can actually go 
ahead and fix out of it or solve out of it. This would be a terrible demo if that that uh did not 
turn green. Um but this is an actual example and as a consequence of this right so the the initial 
proposition was you can save costs by retiming a a particular flight and you had to work through a 
whole bunch of layers on other constraints that you have to go solve for and foundry sort of 
guiding our analysts guiding our scheduulers all the way through at the end of it I'm now 
confident that the solutions or the schedules that I'm putting out for you are safe, they're 
reliable, and they're profitable at the same time. that I'm gonna hand it over to Wan. So you saw the 
the focus that we've had with Foundry has been on driving those efficiencies out of the network and 
a great example that Amit walked through through crew but the potential for this is a lot bigger 
and we want to expand their use of Foundry into this integrated planning platform to network 
planning all the way to all of our operational planning teams and really collapse the workflows 
to find more areas for efficiencies like we have so far. We're incredibly excited. It's just been 
about a years'sl long journey. Like I mentioned, tens of millions of dollars already saved and we 
can't wait for what's next. Thank you. [Applause]
