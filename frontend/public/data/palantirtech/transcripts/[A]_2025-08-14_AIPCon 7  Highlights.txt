TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I don't think in win-lose, I think in domination. If you are one of my competitors, you should fear us, because I am about to crush you. Full stop. We're unashamed, we're unafraid, we're deeply proud of the work that we do. We're deeply proud of our customers. We stand by our customers, and we're going to stay the course. We want speed, we want and need this country to be the strongest, most important country in the world. We've been using the term a palantir unit of time, and that represents when we're thriving value and less than an hour. We put the first application for that into production in three months, reducing the time it takes to clear candidates to the foreign service. From 60 days down to 12, we launched the Minervile product of the provider portal, and under a year saving $100 million of the taxpayers' dollars. This sort of process would take like nine days, now it takes like seconds. We saw a 21-100% increase use of our discharge lounge, you heard me correctly. This is resulted to the equivalent of adding another unit to our hospital. This is a connected fleet operating system, and it really orchestrates customers, vehicles, and our workforce. Like I said, and like Alex said, I came to dominate, crush, and annihilate. So if you're JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, sorry.
