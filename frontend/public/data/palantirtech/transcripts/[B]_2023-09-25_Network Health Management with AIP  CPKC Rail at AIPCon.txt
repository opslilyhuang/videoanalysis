I think all I have to speak is about my industry and then play the video on fast forward mode because 90% of the words, the workflow is going to be repeated. It's so common. Get the data, play through the application, use LLM. I love it. I think the key message at the end of it is the power of the framework and the power of accessibility of this framework. Remember these two words, they are not prepared, that's what I'm learning today. Okay. I'm Philell Shurram. Yes, you heard right. I manage the business intelligence which is innovation as well as cybersecurity which is governance and risk management. I'm from CPKC. On April 14th, we marked an iconic day of merging two big giant historical railroads together that is legacy CP and legacy cancer city southern. We now operate our only single line railway operating in Canada, US and Mexico with 20,000 miles of network. What we're going to talk about today, again, very briefly, we built a solution around network management and potentially our biggest users is service designers. How many of you wondered seeing a train pass by and thought about where are the cars coming from and going to? Imagine someone is wondering about 80,000 cars every day. 80,000 cars with 3000 stations, 5000 customers day in and day out. There is a method to madness and we call it precision schedule railroading. That is a power. All the railroads use. I have my fellow railroads here. We have a love and hate relationship. Don't find any false place. Okay. So the architects of this service of this Christian schedule railroading starts at the design. We have a design how to run the trains. They create order in this chaotic world by giving a unique mission for every car, one car at a time. Where does it start? Where does it go? Which route it takes? What is the best possible way to run the rail road? So we are serving the customer with a minimal cost. Sounds so simple, right? So there are a lot of metrics, a lot of measures which go into the mix and some are publicly disclosed, some are internally monitored. We are going to talk about one such problem of managing dwell. Again, in a simple terms dwell is how much time a car is spending in a yard. Yes, it is supposed to spend time but how much is it planned versus actual? What makes this problem complex is if you are not managing the dwell, if you are not managing the volume of incoming cars into your station right, you are not only impacting the cost and performance of your station but you are also going to impact the incoming trains and outgoing trains. They are by the entire network. And this is an age-old problem. Frankly, every rail road has this problem and it has been the standard optimization problem for any logistics company. So it is the first and last management plan management. One day that is what innovators are promising us that there is quantum computing out there. All we have to do is throw the data, it will give us what to do. I think it is 10 years, 15 years ahead of us for sure. What we are doing now is, again, stealing the words, AI per word, decisions support system. We are not trying to recreate the world, it is eating the entire apple but chunks at a time, taking one problem at a time, taking our data, focus what is going to happen proactively and give power to the user to make informed decisions. So we are using the Palantir platform to attempt it. So the challenge, as I mentioned, is it is a multi-variate statistics problem, typical OR, operations, issues problem. And every logics company is different. On top of that, every rail road is different. We run with different principles, different geographies and different traffic mix. But coming to IT, the biggest challenge is how do we connect business to the models? What I mean is, how do we encode the business knowledge? Not only one time when we build the applications but incrementally as the business changes and evolves. The second problem and the toughest problem, I think someone already spoke today is how do we get those models to business? How do we let them adopt and adapt to these technologies and trust them and not make the technologies obsolete? We hope we have found a formula to do that. We have done it in various ways in technologies and this is another attempt. And I believe we cried the formula this time. So we love maps, rail roaders, all the rail roaders. So here we have a CBKC network in three countries. And we already loaded our data into our ontology, ten years of history. We have a forecasting model running on the same platform telling five days to 14 days out where it could be the potential problems. And these are all the alerts and a user, whether it is service design user or an operations user, can proactively see what could happen three days from now. And again, there is a math and science to it. Math is you have something coming your way. All you're seeing is when is it coming? Science is how do you put external factors in? How do your historical performance in? How do you say what happened when there was a snow storm in the east? How is it going to impact the west? I think all these models are running in the background to give this prediction. I'm not going to show that today. As you we are starting with the alert. And this is a leth, station via Calgary, one of our key junction coming into the west. So what we can do here is we can zoom in and exactly find out what's happening at a leth. And what is the alert saying? In a nutshell, you have some numbers there. What is average dwell? What is leading to the alert? It is 44.2 hours. It is predicting again. It is a notional data. Please do not tell any analysts on anything. We are all perfect. So what we're doing is, again, no one has executives or decision makers wants to know what is true behind it. So we give the trend. And there are a bunch of screens which are not visible in the video. But historical actual volumes and historical actual dwells so that they can link back to operations. And then the next question is how do I address and solve this dwell proactively? And remember, this is all two days out or three days out. So the traffic is already on route to you. It's not that you can't stop the traffic. Some of it is already coming. Some of it customers are about to release. So what we ask in the next step is the co-pilot agent, whatever we call, but the AI agent to say, can you find a solution to me? And this is where the magic is. As I think of Brian spoke, we already included some intelligence. We're asking some questions. Build a plan to reduce well, and I'm let it run. And it is computing. But what it's critical here is we have not loaded our entire intelligence yet. We have loaded some of the levers which we have in control while the traffic is on route to reduce it well. So with the knowledge we shared into the board, it has come up with a plan. Again, it has two steps. Build a bypass block and hold the train. In a nutshell, the first step is saying make sure that traffic is not getting worked in this station. Do the work ahead of time. Second point is saying that there is a train which is about to start 800 miles away. Stop that for 14 hours so that I can clear my yard and make smooth operations. I might like it. I might not like it. But the difference here is whether it is a new service user or an experienced operator, you're already coding the core fundamental business metrics into it. Whether he looks at it or not, whether he or she chooses to acknowledge it or not. We are showing the local impacts as well as the global network level impacts. That is a power of AI when people say that it is going to precalculate and share it with you. It's up to the human. Next step is I think we like the model or we don't like the plan, what it is building. We are trying to simulate, yes, show me the results of your plan. It showed that the dwellings reduced by two hours, but it is comparing the base scenario with the new scenario. It is showing the metrics so that we can challenge what is a cost. We are only showing two metrics or three metrics here, but even shall imagine you're showing the cost metrics, operations metrics, as well as the commercial metrics to it. The next step we built is good. We have one suggestion we chose to take it or ignore it. But we are saying what is the impact of this decision overall. And here there is a complex chat to small to read. On the left side you have all the stations which these trains or the suggestions are going through. Each blue block is an amount of work. What it is telling me is that St. Paul has three yellow boxes. And those three yellow boxes are extra work. Someone else is doing to help me recover from my traffic congestion. And I saw the summary of it. Basically it is saying you have to build two more blocks. Blocks is nothing but a group of ten cars, 40 cars or 100 cars sometimes if it is a unit train. But I know as an experienced railroader, St. Paul is critical. I cannot put more work at St. Paul. So I can go back to the co-pilot and challenge what can you do by ignoring St. Paul and not giving more work to St. Paul. So that is what we are going to do here. I think I skipped it. So we put another constraint. I think the key here is I can repeat it again and again. But the model has been trained by pre-existing levers. But now you are also taking real time information from the operator and including it in the modeling and scenario. But it is not only one time. You are capturing what was a problem, what was a user doing and what kind of scenario he is running with it and what was the result of it. All of it is throwing back into the ontology into the knowledge base where we can or whether the same person or a different person can refer back to. And this is what is called building the knowledge base for the future. And then we know exactly which levers are impacting, how much they are impacting, what is model driven versus what is operator driven, what is data driven technologies. So now we regenerated another solution. It is simulating and we are also saying what if I threw in more crews and more locomotives. We added this search scenario just to explain adding more crews and adding more locomotives is nothing but adding more cost. That is the last option we want to choose as rail roaders is again PSR is running optimal railroad with all the optimal resources. So if you are adding more crews, more resources, it might be beneficial only for certain points but not all the time. So the model goes back, calculates and shares with you the cost impacts as well as the operational impacts of the decision. And imagine you ran three scenarios in a nutshell and the end user is able to say what are the results of each scenario. But not only for once, all the scenarios, all the results are stored forever for this metric, for this particular station. All I have to do it for 2000 more stations across North America. And each station is unique and each journey is unique and we are embarking on a journey. It's not a one time solution but we are encoding intelligence piece by piece into this process. What I like again is the framework where building digital twins of the data, we are including the forecasting models on top of the data and the same platform. We also giving LLMs or easy way to interact with the models and the data by taking real time inputs. In a nutshell, we are building for the future on a platform where we think it is scalable for the future. That's what we are doing at CPKC and again it's notional data Mr. Wailford is. Ellie is perfectly fine and we are right on the right track. Thank you.
