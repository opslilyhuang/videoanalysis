TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I was just translating. It just came to probably better. I was wondering if that's the right thing. Okay. Okay. How are you? Okay. How do you go? Yeah. How do you go? Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, let's put another link. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, when you went to the school, you were going to see a couple of minutes. Yeah. All right, folks, we'll get started in a couple of minutes. Sorry about a minute. So I just grabbed some seats. Don't be afraid. You can actually sit further up. This is like an Australian church meeting. Everyone goes to the back. I was thinking a lecture hall where you always the teacher or the professor has to ask everyone to come to the front. But yeah, it's perfectly fine. So first of all, I'm Matt Turpin, a senior counselor here at Palantir Technologies. It is a delight to have two incredible guests with us to a discussion. First of all, our moderator, Greg Gip, the chief economics commentator at the Wall Street Journal. I've known Greg for a couple of years and we got to know each other here. So I've known you for a couple of years. And I have found his writing and the things that he works on to be some of the most enlightening in journalism. So I find it a real treat to have him here and we're really, really lucky. We also have the ambassador from Australia to the United States, Kevin Rudd, former prime minister two times for Australia, also foreign minister for Australia. And most importantly from my perspective, a recent defill from Oxford in Chinese politics. Is that with the right characterization of it? It doesn't fall neatly into the discipline of Nebraska. But let's call it Chinese party ideology. Very good. Very good. Under random middle at Oxford. So I have incredible respect for someone who is willing to go back and do that kind of study and to become a really worldwide expert in these issues. And so please join me in welcoming them both. And I'm going to turn it over to Greg. Well, thanks very much, Matt, for the introduction. And it really is a privilege to be interviewing Ambassador Rudd. I've known Kevin, if I may, for quite a few years now. And in his capacity at Asia Policy Institute, his books and his writings. And he really is one of the most interesting and provocative and insightful commentators on Chinese elite politics and great power competition. And so I think I like many people had mixed feelings when I learned that he had been named Ambassador from Australia to the United States. On the one hand, I said it isn't wonderful that such a capable person would be in such a key position. On the other hand, does this mean he won't be as insightful and provocative as he has been in the past because he has to like. Absolutely right. Well, I consider my mission today to try and knock him off that like Ambassador Orioles sort of like mindset and try and get him back into the old Kevin Rudd that we know. But we'll see how it goes. Maybe we can strike a happy year. If you succeed, I'll probably have a very short diplomat. But it'd be a great way to go out. Okay, well, let's see where we can go. I went out at Palantir at Davos to the midwife responsibilities of the Wall Street Journal. I like that. Yeah. Well, look, there's been a lot going on on the sort of like the Asia Pacific front and developments in China. Let me start Mr. Ambassador with the most recent one. On Saturday, the DPP candidate in Taiwan was elected as president. What do you think are the implications of this event, especially given what we have seen from both President-Elect Lai and the Chinese since then? Well, if you look carefully at what Lai Ching Duh, William Lai, said prior to the presidential election, he was pretty clear that his core responsibility was to maintain the status quo. And he has a situously avoided engaging in any substance in relation to the independence debate. And there's a reason for that. And that is that Lai Ching Duh has been schooled deeply in my view by its haing one, the previous and continuing president until the inauguration in May, yeah, May 20th. And so, and that is where she moved the DPP Center of Gravity to during the period of her two terms and office. And knowing somewhat his vice presidential candidate and incoming vice president Shalbi Kim, who until recently was the Taiwanese representative in Washington, that would be very much the vice president's center of gravity as well. So the reason I say that at the get-go is what are the dynamics of change here? One, what the Taiwanese themselves do? Two, how does the PRC react? And three of the PRC react, what does the United States do? So I think enough effort has been made both by the Taiwanese themselves in one form or another, direct and indirect channels, plus through the United States and the representations by a number of former and serving officials and a few others. And I think through the Chinese direct observations that whereas they would not like, like Chengdu's William Lai's election, they cannot see at the stage the objective basis for any substantive change. So what does all that mean? Is that I think consistent with China's broader foreign policy strategy, which is to pursue at least a 12 month period of strategic stabilization with the United States for a range of other policy imperatives, that will extend to the Taiwan equation as well? What happens beyond 2024 is a separate question, but that I think is a reasonable projection for the year ahead? In San Francisco, apparently President Xi told President Biden that like the Taiwan reunification question remained a paramount in the most core of core interests to China, and the implications some got was that to the extent there's a timeline for reunification that might be getting shorter, what is your read of what you have seen from the Chinese on this run? The Chinese expression is kind of interesting. It reminds me of what Jiang Zemin used to say about the US-China relationship in Chinese, which means the most important of the most important. So it's a wonderful language, Chinese, gives you multiple possibilities. But I think the truth is CCP ideology on natural reunification has not changed since 1949. Secondly, it's intensified under Xi Jinping since 2012. Some of the declaratory language used by the system has changed. More conspicuously, the operational behaviour of the PLA has changed. And therefore, if you look for example at patterns of PLA behaviour in relation to Taiwan activity prior to the policy visit, which was in August of 2002, and that mats around. My permanent fact check in August of 2002, that's the pattern of activity across the median line, the intensity of activity, etc. has been significantly upped. If you were to do a graph and track plaff plan, that's PLA Air Force, PLA Navy, and other elements of Chinese military activity, including grey zone activity, against Taiwan over the decade, it's a graph that goes like that. That hasn't changed. The last thing to say though about core of the core is the one material factor that we have that's changed in Chinese declaratory policy that we should focus on since Xi Jinping became leader. Well, he's bring forward of the date for the completion of military modernisation of the PLA from 2030s back to 2027. And so, do I therefore see in the immediate period ahead by which I mean 2024 any further move in that direction? No, for the reasons we've just discussed. Has the political strategy on the part of Xi Jinping changed in relation to Taiwan? No. So therefore, we should not make any premature conclusions and wipe the sweat from our brow that if it's going to be a quiet year in 2024, that the problem has been solved. That will not be the case. Thank you. So, you can't undo the things you've written, so I'm going to go to something that you're book in 2019, the avoidable war. Okay. Mr. Ambassador, since you wrote... 22, it came out, not 29 days. Oh, is that okay, sir. Yeah, it crystallised, I think, really why there are these like fundamental forces coming between the United States and China, the growing bipartisan belief that engagement had failed, that growing mistrust between the two sides. And at some level, a belief certainly in the United States that the systems were fundamentally incompatible. Oh, by sort of like summarised the gist of the book. My question to you is since you wrote that, has war become more or less avoidable? I think it always takes two to tango in this business. Number one, if you were to begin to look at operation of the clarity policy change by China towards the United States, after about 2017, after the United States and at the Trump administration, in fact when Matt was working with Matt Poddenger and the NSC, and they adopted a new declaratory position on the behalf of the United States called Strategic Competition, the end of engagement. From that period on, you begin to see the Chinese in the tone, content and structure of their declarations and statements, shifting gear fundamentally. So therefore, we should not simply say that this is a view driven primarily by bipartisan consensus in the United States Congress, and now by both the current administration and I think alternative administrations. It has actually been mirrored by a deep change in strategic thinking and Beijing. And if you want to look at analysis to a proof point as to why that is the case, the 20th party Congress, which was only convened in October of 2022, a 20 year long phrase in the conference report which said that we are still enjoying a period of strategic opportunity. That's code language in ideological speak for continued peace, so we can focus on economic development. After 20 years, that's gone. So let's just focus on that element. Then you go to the United States and you're correct to point out that Dems and Republicans essentially have a common view, both at the declaratory level, manage strategic competition, but also I think across the operational domains of the relationship as well. What has changed in terms of the central thesis about an avoidable war, is that both sides became concerned at the end of 2022 that this may be careering out of control, because of the rolling intensification of incidents, for which the most spectacular one, of course, was the balloon incident of February of 2023. And therefore, there was a predisposition to try and put some parameters around this in order to take the overall geopolitical temperature down several notches. Against that matrix, therefore, if we were to say, is there for a war more or less probable than when I wrote the book in 2024, you would say less. But I suspend judgment in terms of what happens beyond that. For the simple reason is, if you look carefully at Xi Jinping's writings, and I'm one of those old-fashioned guys who goes back to the primary sources and reads what they say to their own system. And his writings during 2023 about the differentiation between tactics and strategy, published in the party's theoretical journal called Chil-Shui. It's quite plain that there is a big differentiation in their own analysis as to what means what is a tactical pause as opposed to a change in strategic direction. So, I suspend judgment about 2025. Well, what is that strategic direction then, if what has happened, so there has been a bicloment consensus, some stabilization since Xi and Biden met in San Francisco. So, you're seeing that underlying strategy, at least from Beijing's point of view, has not changed. What is that strategy? I've said there's no evidence to date that that's changed. And what I see in the internal ideological literature is a fair degree of continuity, not just on foreign policy, but actually in the high politics of the Chinese economy as well. Well, in fact, that's a great way to segue to what the question was going to be, which is fundamentally, like, I think one of the realizations in the United States was fundamentally the Leninist character of the economy's party of China, and that this sort of just accentuated the absence of compatibility of these two systems to coexist in one global order. What have you seen from Xi on that front in the last few years? Has, have you noticed a hardening or a crystallization of his fundamental ideological beliefs that, in some sense, stark and might even make even more stark the differences between their system and ours? I think what's clear over the 10-year period, and there's a piece of mine in Foreign Affairs Magazine, I think about 12 months ago, just before I decided to become a diplomat. So it's me as a scholar speaking rather than me as a diplomat speaking, saying that if you look at all the elements of Xi Jinping's ideology, and the policy proceeding from ideology over the 10 years that he's been in office, my high-cus summary of it is as follows. He has deliberately pushed the politics of the country towards the Leninist left. He has deliberately unconsciously pushed the economic policy settings of the country towards the Marxist left. And he has consciously supported a parallel move of nationalism and China's foreign policy direction more towards the nationalism to right, by which I mean a predisposition to change the national status quo. So I do not see on the politics question in terms of his Leninist predispositions any change at all. Those who are for me sort of an analysis which says that because of a bit of ideological overreach on the economy that he has changed course, I think if you look at all the elements of Leninist power and praxis, for example, the continued deployment of the anti-corruption campaign, the continued deployment of the parties, what they call rectification movement machinery, is a remarkably hard-line Leninist approach to party control and the internal control of the leader over the party. Go to the economy. That is a more complex debate because you've seen growth slow. Why is it slowed? Combination of factors. Some structural like demography, some structural which have not been addressed yet, which is property and finance. But also some of ideology, which is the direction since the 19th party congress in 2017 for the private sector to get back in its box. So, and it is one of the contributing factors in my analysis as to why the growth numbers in China have faltered. Because the engine room of growth in the whole Dungshuoping period, Junsemin and Hujintao, was this vibrant private sector. So that I think we have seen an attempt to policy correct in the last 12 to 18 months, particularly as they have come, started to come out of COVID, which remember was only about 12 months ago with the abolition of zero COVID. But here is where we have the problem of double messaging. There are policy measures to re-embrace the private sector. Policy messages to re-embrace the property sector. There are attempts to stabilize equity markets, which have been performing badly. But the overlaying level of ideological direction towards a more dominant party in the management of the economy has not changed. So therefore, Chinese entrepreneurs who make up 61% of GDP look at this and say, do I accept what the state council is saying to me that we really love you? Or do I read the party's theoretical journal which says, we don't love you that much. And being a bunch of pragmatists, and they are very pragmatic in Chinese business community, they look at the market signals and the policy signals. And they are still in my judgment cautious about which way they go. So I think that's kind of where we've got to so far. I see some policy change but no ideological change yet on the economy. There was an interesting data point on China that came out this week which was population which declined last year or the second year in a row. At a faster rate, the number of births, half of what it was in 2016 when the one child policy was formally rescinded. What is the significance of this? And how is it likely to affect CRCC thinking about its own long-term economic ambitions? This is a fundamental concern to the leadership because if you stand back from the day to day and look at the future trajectory of the Chinese economy, what have you got going for you? You've got the good old Chinese consumer who's currently got average income of about 14,000 US. So there's a huge gap in terms of what they currently have and what they'd like to consume and what they need to save for. This is on balance if you look at the untapped potential of the Chinese consumer if there's enough consumer confidence. Is it an almost plus and assets still notwithstanding the Chinese population peaking? What's going against you in terms of your future growth drivers? What's going against you are the structural factors of demographic change which are profound and accelerating. It's not just the rapid decline in the birth rate, it is also the parallel phenomenon of the aging of the population, the absence of effective social security provision for age care and for retirement income, quite apart from health and education. What does that mean for the consumer? Save more and don't consume as much because you've got to save for a rainy day. This is a profound factor which is not just at the bald superficial numbers of India has now passed China. India continues to grow at a phenomenal population growth rate and China is now peaked. It's underneath that the fiscal consequences of actually having a growing population when you are only, frankly, at a per capita income of 14,000 which is a low middle income country. That is quite unique in development history. That is why Xi Jinping and the comrades have been speaking so volubly about the responsibilities of Chinese fair maidens to go and do their duty for the Communist Party. I'm not seeing hearing a stampede of the fair maidens heading in the direction of their duties to the party in the state. What comes next after that are not altogether clear. It is a big one. The parallel structural problem is declining productivity growth, coming off the back of a tremulous private sector because all the productivity comes out of the private sector. These big headwinds of private sector business confidence, demography and productivity. I think these are the things which preoccupy the leadership now and I do not see clear solutions yet on either of those three fronts. I want to pivot the camera lens away from China itself and look at the Australia and the United States and indeed the entire Western world. There are three fairly significant partnerships now taking shape in the Western, in the Pacific region. One is quad which of course predates the Biden administration which I think is actually Prime Minister Abe's conception. The other is August, the nuclear submarine sharing agreement between the UK and Australia and the United States. Finally I think also very important, the Camp David principles where the United States managed to bring South Korean Japan together in an unprecedented cooperative fashion. One could step back and see almost like this piece by piece, Mosaic of Western United States letter lines is forming. What is the big picture going on here? Are we almost seeing like an all but name a Pacific NATO taking form here? How durable is this? What are challenges to making, to operationalizing some of these agreements? I'd say to my great and powerful friends of the United States, NATO is not the only organizing principle in the world for sorting out your national security ship. Is that a high coup? Let me take back the... In the particular circumstances which formed an orth Atlantic treaty organization, an orth Atlantic treaty, were different from those which pertained in post war east and southeast Asia. So, but so therefore the idea of NATOism, I don't think it's a live concept either in the way in which any of the US allies in Asia think. And that doesn't mean that we don't work with each other, we do. It's just a radically different set of security circumstances with some interlocking factors as well. I think what has unfolded over the course of the last half decade has been if you were an international relations theorist you'd stand back and just say a whole bunch of states have gone from from either sitting on the fence to balancing and certainly not bandwagoning in terms of deciding to locate the nation. So, we're not going to reach their national security futures with the inevitability of China's rise. So, where what I think is the common organizing principle around the arrangements you just spoke of, which is quad, which is orcas, and which is the trilaterals with the Northeast Asians, is a desire to reobtain and then to sustain strategic equilibrium in the wider East Asian theatre. And because in the absence of that equilibrium, for those countries which are not aligned, it creates a much more problematic environment for them to maintain their neutrality as well, and that's by which I mean Southeast Asian. So, I think that's the organizing principle at a very broad level. And finally, on the orcas thing, it's not just submarines. The legislation which went through the House and the Senate and signed by the president into law in the week before Christmas. For the first time in history creates a seamless Australia, UK, US defense science and technology industry with no regulatory barriers between them. I actually don't want to touch on that a little bit because I've been writing somewhat in the last six months about the defense industrial base, and I think there's a growing realization in almost a level of horror in the United States that we're involved in this highly intense conflict in Ukraine as a proxy to be sure. And it's using up a lot of munitions and we do not have the ability to replace them. One statistic that just like shocked me other day is that the Tomahawks that we fired apparently at the Houthis last week of the week before it takes a year to replace those. So, and it's not just a US problem, it's a European problem. Do Western nations need to create a new effort to expand their defense capabilities, not just in terms of people under arms, but in terms of like their manufacturing base and their defense industrial base, and can alcus be a template for doing that? And so the first part of the question is yes. Combination. And by the way, is Australia doing exactly that? Does the Albanese government have a plan to expand its? It does. The defense industry plan as in the process of being released by the Australian government. It's probably the most far reaching re-examination of our own national defense industrial base since the Second World War. Fortunately in our own country, because we've been long-standing allies in the United States, we probably have about, you know, two, three hundred significant defense firms in the country doing a range of different capabilities, often in collaboration with the United States. And that has always been constrained by this regulatory environment which you've had under what's called the Arms Export Control Act and the ITAS, Regulatory Regime, the International Traffic and Arms Regulations, which was an instrument of the Cold War design to prevent the proliferation of US weaponry either into Eastern Europe or into Latin American dictatorships at the time. So, but it became a huge impediment. So therefore, given the intensity now of hot war in the case of Ukraine, which is a phenomenally hot war which is enormously difficult to maintain. And so, but it became a huge impediment. So therefore, given the intensity now of hot war in the case of Ukraine, which is a phenomenally hot war which is enormously consuming of men and women and material on a daily basis which we are largely not conscious of in terms of a general defense. And so, we are not conscious of in terms of it being before our eyeballs every minute of the day. This has had a huge impact in terms of wake up call in Europe and on the part of the other allies. By the way, to be fair to the Asian allies, the Japanese, the Koreans and ourselves are all contributing billions of dollars in military kitten equipment to the Ukrainians, which we've been doing since the get-go. We are not thinking about the theater, but we think it's the right thing to do. But therefore, let's create a parallel message in Japan. If you look at Prime Minister Kishitaz, extraordinarily important statement about doubling Japanese defense expenditure, that too is to do with their defense industrial base. Last point in terms of the applicability of Orcas, our own council would be, let's see how it goes in practice. The law was just signed into being about a month ago. We've got to do the regulations yet on how it's going to operate in practice. But what I said to other countries of expressed interest in this is if it works, and if it does, turbocharged the defense industrial base in our three countries, by creating three frankly sets of defense technologies working synchronistically, holistically, in a fully integrated manner with corporate operations going 24 or 7 across these three geographies, then if we get that under our belt in the next year or so, then of course, I think there's an opportunity for the United States as it's the principle and all this to begin to look at others. But not for me to say, because last time I looked on not an American. So let me ask you a question that's a purely Australian, almost a purely Australian question. So another issue in fact, as I think, was a key agenda item for the Japanese leadership of the G7 last year, which is the question of economic coercion. And what we were talking about effectively is China using its economic tool set to punish countries for political disputes. And Australia was on the, you know, basically felt the full force of this in the last couple of years when the previous Morrison government called for inquiry. And the origins of COVID and soon Australia found exports of coal of wine of like agricultural products all blocked blocked by China. In the last year or two, we've seen some improvement on that front and some of those restrictions have been dropped. What is the lesson that the world and Australia has learned from this particular episode in terms of the efficacy of Chinese economic coercion? You know, my high-court response would be in two characters. Don't blink. That's just it. Don't blink. It's tempting sometimes to blink, but don't blink. I mean, I'm a long-term student of the Chinese CCP. In fact, I did all my undergraduate work on Chinese domestic politics back in the mesolithic period when I was at university at the Australian National University. Because it's a Leninist party, it's a party which respects strength and its contemptuous of weakness. That's just the tradition. Therefore, when you see the use or deployment of economic coercion as an instrument of foreign policy, then it's important to simply say no. Secondly, and this is the harder question. With friends, partners and allies, you actually therefore need collaborative arrangements so that others simply don't race into fill your market opportunity when fill the market opportunity once you've exited the market. You know, I'm not surprised to see you guys, but when they kicked out the entire Australian wine industry, the first in the back door was Napa. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate that a lot. The Chileans too, as I recall. Therefore, it's a truly example, but not a few billion dollar business in Australia, I mean selling that into the Chinese market. So there is work to be done on this question. So if you're Lithuania, for example, which is a small Baltic state, but has been on the receiving end of this, if you are Sweden, which is a significant state and a significant economy, middle sized economy, and you're on the receiving end of this, if you are the R.O.K. And you've had coercive measures applied to you, for example, in the restriction of the sale of Kia and Hyundai into the country. There's something we need to do as allies to frankly look after each other under those circumstances. It's easy to proclaim, don't blink, and we didn't, but there was nowhere actually around the world to demonstrate rather not to be a part of the world. So we're old enough and ugly enough to probably look after ourselves in Australia. And as I've said to many Chinese friends, if you're going to try to coerce any culture in the world, why would you pick on the Australians? I mean, fundamental analysis of human nature is that you tell an Australian to do something, and they will inevitably do the reverse. So I touched on alliances, and okay, so former President Trump, of course, put a lot of pressure on the US system of alliances. He used to feel like the United States was systematically losing out to them. And so both on the economic military and strategic front, you saw unprecedented pressure on the health and sustainability of the alliances. I'm sure you read the polls as well as the rest of us do. You saw the outcome of the Iowa caucus on Monday, that Trump won by a landslide. What would a return of President Trump to the White House next year mean for Australia, US relations, and the alliance, US alliance structure more generally? You knew this one was coming. I think we'll first of all to state the obvious. I mean, all these remarks are making us as a China scholar, and I'm not here as an ambassador. As a reminder, it's on the record. Yeah, yeah, I know that. But it's these are the views of Kevin and not the views of anyone else. Because the questions you've asked are analytical questions primarily. On this one, I mean, the truth is, if you object to the look at the history of the Trump administration, there were a bunch of frictions with the Europeans over a level of defense expenditure. But the foundational question there, which is the under expenditure on the part of many, but not all of the Europeans, on defense as a proportion of GDP, is a valid criticism, which goes back to the Obama administration. If you're averaging 1% of GDP, which is essentially the medium point, correct me if I'm wrong, of NATO. In the given the environment that you're now facing with Russia, literally, on the march, like on the march, it's not a metaphor, it's actually a direct and literal statement. Then whether it's a Democrat administration or a Republican administration, from the point of view of strategic equilibrium stability, I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with the United States saying to the Europeans, you need to do more. Similarly, with the rest of us, Australia, we're now at about 2.1% of GDP, the Japanese are moving from 1 to 2% of GDP, the ROK is always always being north of that because of the particular problems, to which they face to the north of them. Therefore, at that level, while the pressures and the tensions, both on defense outlays and on trade policy, were acute, in an objective analysis, nothing fractured. That's what I'm saying, nothing fractured. Was it tense? Well Matt will know from his time at the NSE, there were a lot of tense. But did anything break? No. So I think that's one point we should all bear in mind for the future. Secondly, if you move to the other side of it, which is just the trade economic front, remember the Biden administration's posture on trade is clear from the statements that have been made by the administration. It is unclear where a second Trump administration would go on trade policy beyond where it was last time round. Did that break the international trading system? No. Did it impose pressures on the international trading system? Yes. In one specific area, which is the non-functioning nature of the dispute resolution machinery that WTO. But that is continued over the last three and a half years as well. So I think we are in some danger of overstating the degree of quote damage. The one thing which the world will focus on is this, what materially transpires in relation to Ukraine. Given what the President Trump on the campaign trail has said about further military support by the United States for Ukraine, and what would therefore happen in practice, the reverberations of that as a shift in policy would be profound. That is terrific. I think we have some time for questions. Should I... Let me go first. I will hand this around. So, Mr. Rudd, you spoke a little bit about Aakis, but obviously this has been a big focus of your last year. Particularly this position on being able to adjust the ITAR and figuring out how do we create a common industrial base. So, I just want to give you the floor a little bit to explain why is Aakis significant? And what vision do you think that you have for the Australian government has for what it looks like in the future? I mean, clearly it came about at the beginning of the Biden administration, and there was a vision there, and I think it's important for us to understand what that is. So, if you could maybe elaborate on that. Yeah, I mean, it's an acronym which often passes people by in terms of what it means apart from it meaning the three countries. There are two arms. One is the most discussed, which is about for the first time the United States transferring the technology for nuclear propulsion for submarines to another country other than the United Kingdom. And that's because we're in the business of our next generation of building our next generation of conventional subs. We have always had subs because we're a maritime power. But the deep evaluation on the part of the Australian Defence Community is given emerging strategic vulnerabilities and technological vulnerabilities. The wisest thing we could do is to take the step to acquire our own nuclear power submarine fleet. Secondly, in doing that, this is the advantage of the United States, when fully developed you will have an entire fleet of about nine ten boats in the Australian geography, which are nuclear power, which are enormously capable by any global standards against any foreseeable technological challenge. You will also have a nuclear subship building capability in Australia. There's only three others in the world, two in the United States, one in Groton, in Connecticut and the second ones at Newport News in Virginia. And the third is in the United Kingdom. This will be the fourth in the world. And therefore, it provides the United States Navy as they deploy around the world with a further shipyard and a ship repair facility for boats. And this is a highly specialized set of technologies. So from the US and the Allied point of view, that is huge. The second arm of it is called Orcas Pillar II. And this is the big one which we just talked about. It's called advanced technologies. When we look back at this in a decade's time, people may still talk about the submarines, but I'll probably talk about things we haven't fully conceived of yet, which is the next generation of weapons systems and weapons platforms period. What are they in terms of the unmanned categories in the air under the water and elsewhere? And frankly, the whole range of associated technologies, which come out of artificial intelligence. Up until now, this has been constrained by the regulatory barriers between our three countries. As of one January 2024, they are gone. So these defense companies literally probably about a thousand of them in the UK, two or three hundred of them in Australia, and all of your defense industrial base in the United States will now act seamlessly. And this will be good for all three countries in rebuilding the industrial base, acquiring a whole bunch of new skill sets and acquiring a scale that we need, and frankly, the redundancy we need across our system. To take one specific example on missiles, we intend to start producing our own category of conventional missiles. And if we will probably not have any immediate use or utility for them, but in terms of the overall Western stockpile, remember the America's great strategic advantage for the decades ahead, you have 46 treaty allies. And so, the idea is that these therefore become a deployable stockpile for a range of purposes. Obviously, someone's got to pay for them. But the bottom line is you're going to have these capabilities being developed now at greater speed and intensity, and with greater redundancy and resilience in the UK and in the United States and in Australia. Thank you so much. It's a fantastic always as always to hear you. I wanted to go back to the economic coercion question and using your experience with Australia, particularly with eyes on South America, and I'm deliberately excluding Mexico and not Latin America and that question. Just as an example, the Chilean private sector is deeply concerned about the level of Chinese investment in critical infrastructure, roads, utilities, having seen what happens when you ask the wrong question and being a much smaller economy than Australia was. What advice would you give to the United States, which for all the talk of a renewed monoductrin? I don't see that there's been meaningful investment there. I might not be seeing it in terms of shoring up that region given the necessary investment they're receiving on infrastructure from China, but the implications of what that can mean from a power perspective. The future of global power generates from three sources, heart-military power, broad economic power, and specific technological power, which becomes applicable both to economies and to militaries. Therefore, whichever government you've got, either in Santiago de Chile or Buenos Aires or in Brasilia, that'd be like governments in Hanoi and in Dacca and in Jakarta, looking at what are the global mega trends here? Where's the balance of military power going? Where are the centres of technology power going? And where is the centre of global economic power measured through the size of an economy and its international footprint through trade, investment and capital flows? I know that sounds like sort of geopolitics 101, but it's important just to state those as basic principles, because that's the prism through which the governments of the continent of South America will view these realities like they do in Asia. Therefore, it is important without providing a piece of public policy advice for the United States, because that's not my business. But it's important to consider where South America's future aggregate economic opportunities lie, in trade and investment and in capital flows. Well, to flip that on its head, when I look at a population of the United States of 350 million? 330 million? 330 million? 330 million? The population of Latin America combined is probably in the vicinity of 6 to 700 million. In the Americas, you have a billion plus people. The way I would see that in the global geoeconomic game is given notwithstanding all the political frictions, I'm not being polyannarish about how difficult some of these relationships are to build. But I look at proximity and I look at familiarity and the deep and rising significance of the Hispanic community within the United States itself. And Bob Zellik has written on this in Times Past. You begin to aggregate the enormous economic potential as a market and as part of your supply chains, South America. Don't see it as a problem, see it as an opportunity. That changing the lens on the Western hemisphere, and this is not Munro Part 2 or Part 1, it is co-equal economic partners. That I think fundamentally shifts the nature of the economic dynamic between the countries of South America and China, the countries of South America and the United States. The very final thing in the more immediate sense is what are the sources of investment capital, where China is dominant, is an infrastructure investment, BRI and BRI plus, and not just in South American. You look at the Caribbean, what's being built in the 13th, Ireland States, the Caribbean, I think, from memory. Most of them are Commonwealth countries because I know them reasonably well. The absence of alternative sources of investment capital. So therefore, publicly, the United States is not in the business of organizing a BRI, but in terms of the enormous deployable capital through the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, but also blended finance with under-deployed US private capital markets. There is a huge alternative here, which is actually bigger if you aggregate it than anything to do with the trillion dollars which the Chinese have deployed so far through the BRI. So what I see is opportunity opportunity, rather than shall I say, the necessity to simply engage in hand-ringing about this. Any other questions? Hi, I'm Jamie Fly, one of my colleagues from Palantir. We've been very active on the ground in Ukraine, both on the military front as well as working with Ukrainians on civilian reconstruction. And the Ukrainian experience with defense innovation in the face of an overwhelming hardware advantage by the Russians has driven some of the debate that you referenced in the US certainly about how to bring in software, our tech ecosystem into our rather antiquated defense procedures and doctrine. And you touched on this a little bit, but I'm curious if you could say a little bit more about how that debate is playing out in Australia, and especially on the high tech side and software. And then also your read on Beijing's lessons that they're drawing from what they've seen play out in Ukraine, where certainly I think tech and software played a key role in the early phase of the war. But even now you certainly see a kind of innovation competition between Russia and Ukraine on the front lines, especially in the drone warfare arena. And I'm just curious how you see the Chinese responding to that with their own planning for future conflicts and areas. Well, most fascinating conferences that I attended recently was AUSA in Washington, which brought together not just the American but the Allied defense industries under one exhibition roof. And just to see this extraordinary array of technologies, these are the ones on public display, as opposed to those non-hom public display, which are being deployed to the battle space in Ukraine. And so you're right. I mean, this because of the dynamics of what we're talking about, it has spurned an enormous amount of innovation creativity in firms which are used to sticking widgets together in things that go bang and pop. And so this is remarkable and can create countries like Ukraine with a range of emerging asymmetric capabilities. Point two, you're correct to point out that this is not a static game. The team red, whoever team red happens to be, is also acutely conscious of this. How has it been interpreted in Beijing? The PLA, I would calculate, so I'm not reflecting on any privileged information here, I would calculate given what they've done with multiple US military operations in the past, the first goal for, the second goal for, etc. We'll be undertaking forensic studies, item by item in the battle space of what's been effective, what's been ineffective. And I think therefore we need to be, if there's one cautionary tale to emerge from this, is not to assume, however long it takes the Russians to adapt, that the Chinese will be as slow to adapt. Because they have a formidable defense science and technology based themselves. This is a dynamic game. The final point though I'd make is artificial intelligence in the pre-preparation, pre-disposition on the part of the United States and China, but the Chinese most significantly to now open an AI dialogue with the United States. I find that inherently fascinating because I don't think it's about creating a global regulatory structure. It may be, and in terms of the application of AI to weapon systems, there's a whole new debate about robotic warfare which you're familiar with here at Palantir, and how is this ultimately contained and can it be contained. But I sense at this stage, and here we are in January of 2024, that our friends in China are acutely conscious of their deficiencies in AI across potential battle spaces. But it's a dynamic game, but it's being looked at forensically and Beijing. Thanks very much. I was hoping that the thought provoking and insightful Kevin Rudd that I knew before he became ambassador would show up and I was not disappointed. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Ambassador. It was really appreciated. Well, thank you everyone. We will, just if we have a couple of moments, folks who come up and introduce themselves, but then we'll have to clear on out. Thank you very much. you you
