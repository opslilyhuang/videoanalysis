TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello everyone, so my name is David Fernandes and working in Boataranting. Boataranting we are a manufacturing construction products building products. We are a Brazilian company that we are representing today the North American site of the business and the goal here today is to explain to all of you how we engage with Boataranting and what is the use case that we decided and why we decided to do does use case which for us is an S&OB so we are trying to resolve what is sales forecasting, production planning and the logistics scheduling but we are going to talk about that in a minute. And my name is Colin Davis and I lead the data strategy team at Keywit. We are one of North America's largest and most respected construction engineering firms and something that's really paramount for our data services department is to look to mitigate risk across the entire landscape of the construction project life cycle. And so we've built some really great tools internally over the last couple of years but about five months ago we started a partnership with Palantir with the hopes of tackling some really really challenging and complex GNI use cases. And so I think David and I were asked to speak to what is the next 12 months look like at each of our organizations and for us it's fairly simplistic. We have to make the use cases we've been building truly come to life. So about five months ago like I said we started our build. The build has been excellent really really talented Palantir engineering team, great platform. So I think the product we're building is great but in 2025 we have to do two things. We have to get to production and that doesn't just mean the tech that means we have to embed these workflows into our processes and we have to drive adoption with our users and then second we have to actually show tangible business value. If we can do those two things there's several other tangential use cases we could pursue that I think are very very high value but I don't think we'll get the appetite to do that if we're not successful with these initial few. Yes so as Colin said in our case is the same. We are now working in implementation of the use case we decided what to do at the beginning should we choose something that is low-handy fruits should we choose something that is real complex and creates a lot of values so we went for the second option we choose one of the most complicated problems in our company which is logistics how to the interaction logistic cells and operations. We are close to resolve it we are close to go to production so once we are able to show the team what is the value that we are creating with that use case the idea is that we are gonna now trigger probably that everybody's gonna come to us and say well you know I have same problem or a more complicated problem than this can you have me out so we are gonna kind of create the pipeline of use cases for the for the next round and then we need to work on the change management tool right so we need to give the team the capabilities to build those tools by themselves and to interact with the with the solution so they can create as much value as possible. Something that came up when David and I were prepping for this conversation was we both realized we were pursuing really high-value really complex use cases that frankly we weren't sure would work and we chose these over maybe more feasible but moderately valuable use cases and it sparked this conversation on how do we how do we balance risk and reward what comes to use case valuation so at least on the key with side we for sure want to keep a balance portfolio we're certainly doing a lot of the more feasible maybe moderately valuable use cases but it's also important to make some strategic bets on pursuing some higher value use cases that if successful could be really transformative to your business. Yeah so building on that the same case for us we we decided to go into this complex problem because it's it's a way that we believe we can transform the way we work because today information like many of you all the information is in silos so the way that Palantir brings the data or treats the data is become the data becomes so democratic so everybody can access the information and takes decisions very quick and you know we will have now to once the this solution is into production we'll have to review processes because this is gonna change the way we work. That's our time thank you
