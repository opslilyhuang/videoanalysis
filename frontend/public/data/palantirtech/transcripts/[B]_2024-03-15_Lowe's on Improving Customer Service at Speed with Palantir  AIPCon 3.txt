TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right. How many of you have had a home improvement project or bought something? All right. You better have bought it at Lowe's and if not, you better get download the Lowe's app right now. Or maybe a little bit later. However, I just want to say thank you so much to the Palantir crew for inviting us out here and sharing with everybody what we've been able to do in record time. So I will echo what Scott said about record speed to market. So let me tell you a little bit of a story about our home services like business. As a customer, you can go into a Lowe's store or shop us on Lowe's.com and you can pick out exactly what you want to do for the project you have in mind, whether or not it's a kitchen, a bath, a flooring project. It could actually be a roofing project, a fencing project. You name it. Once you've checked out, essentially, it moves to a team that is about 1700 people and it's a call center. They monitor all of the activities to take that to actual completion for our customers. We've had some, I'm going to call it dated ERP solution that the team has been working with. And with dated, I'm sure you can imagine this. A lot of spreadsheets, a lot of access databases, some sitting on somebody's machine. And you can imagine with a remote crew, that makes it really difficult to actually audit the business itself to make sure that projects are getting completed on time and customers are getting exactly what they needed. So last year, we actually began working with Palantir on another use case for supply chain. And not here to talk to you about that one. As we were like learning really quickly from our supply chain use case and we understood what we wanted to do with our home services business. We actually said, wait a second, we have another use case for you. And so we actually rallied the troops and let me just walk you through what happened next. So there was a crew from Palantir that were from Oslo and London that came into Charlotte, North Carolina, began to work with us in understanding our problems. And then we actually used foundry to build in like the data stitched together on topologies. And we created a POC in record time. And because of what we saw in the POC, we actually said we were able to reduce overdue activities, overdue activities, just think of the word overdue, not good. And essentially 75% reduction in those activities, which means we were improving our customer service. On top of that, people were becoming more productive. And on top of that, managers had more like insight into what was actually happening with like the business itself. And in less than four months, we created something from POC all the way to production. And I'm hoping Alex is in London and we've reached a thousand people a day. But essentially on average, we have a thousand people who are working simultaneously. You can see like where we've been, but we launched. And I will tell you, the call center agents or what we like to say is our services like organization. They're so excited about this like new technology. And Alex said like, you know, making us slower and dumber, like Palantir has made us faster and smarter in general. And one of the things that, you know, you always pride yourself on is how fast can I do something to make somebody happy? And the business itself couldn't believe how fast we were able to do this. And so with that, there's a lot more work ahead of us for sure. And as you can imagine now that the business says, all right, we have the ability to have birds eye view, prioritize like workflows, essentially understand the productivity and health of our like network, what else can we do? So we're thinking how do we like to take AIP to the next level so that when a call center agent needs to contact a provider who hasn't, you know, shown up for a job where things are running behind, we're actually sending that person a little nudge and it's not a person calling at the end of the day. So we are just now getting started in our journey, but I will tell you this like without Palantir, we definitely would not have been able to solve this as quickly as possible. And with that, Alex, if you're watching in London, thank you so much for being part of the team. I echo everything that Scott said is that the team rallied and literally showed up wearing the red vest for us. Thank you.
