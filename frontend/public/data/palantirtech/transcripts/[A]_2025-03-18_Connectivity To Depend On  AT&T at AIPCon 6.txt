TRANSCRIPT

Thank you. I'm used to sitting out there, so this is a real thrill to be up here in front of you all today. AT&T has been working with Palantir for well over five years with over 39,000 people at AT&T having touched Foundry with 8,500 active users every month and over 600 different use cases. We've been working together to help make analytics operational and operations analytical at AT&T. A while back, however, some of my network operations partner said, hey, what if we can get the data even closer to operations in real time? What would be possible? What could we build? What could we do in order to make an impact on the business? And how could we do that with the people in the business working on the business? Our network operations team handles a massive amount of data, but it's all siloed across different sources. That often means that we can be missing important context upstream when we try to solve issues that we see on the network. We started with building a network ontology. Here we said ontology again, right? Probably get tired of hearing it. Digital twin of our physical network. So that's all the inventory, circuit types, equipment, towers, locations, you name it. All again, connected by those people in the business working on the business because they're closest to the data solving problems every day. Really sets the foundation for us to take actionable insights, not just create dashboards. By the way, it's really hard to do any of this with AI until the foundation comes together through the ontology. Really truly believe that. So how do we do that? How do we bring that real time data into impact operations? And what we come up with is a tool called Scout. Scout is the smart correlation and ontological unification tool. Say that five times fast. I'll just keep saying Scout. But my partner, Chris May and network operations had this idea like how do we actually bring everything around the network? How do we bring it together so we understand the living, breathing actions that the network is taking so we can go and go understand how to solve the problems that we see. How do we get there? So we need to bring in things like all the alarms happening on the network. What's the weather like? Is there power outage? Is there cable cut? Is there planned maintenance? Is there something happening out there that just let somebody just acting on a ticket couldn't go just take care of? We might have unnecessary truck rolls or something happening out there. It's streaming data. And if you're in a large enterprise, you probably heard it before. It's too hard. Can't do it. We tried it before. Heard it a million times. We knew with what we had already in Foundry that we could get this, we could get this, we work with the Palantir team and get it done. Scout really just collects all the alarms and everything happening around the network and correlates it together. With the full physical model of our network, we can use the ontology to make the better decisions, go act on those tickets, maybe not act on them if we don't need to. But we can deal with the right people, the right response and the right time. I probably heard that before. I think I heard it from two previous speakers. Everything that we do here in Scout that I'll show is connected with our external dispatching and response system that allows us to actually take those actions, not just look at them. It's all built with Foundry's streaming capabilities. Let's dig in and take a little bit of a look at what Scout actually does. What began as a joint effort between 18 team Palantir now has over 118 T dedicated engineers and a dedicated support team that we run, help care for this application. It's just one of the 660 plus applications that we have on Foundry today. Main goals, root cause all those tickets. Do it through real-time automation, which is extremely challenging. What we'll show is there's millions of tickets and alarms every day coming in. How do we actually figure out what it all means? How do we get it together? What we knew it could do is reduce those unnecessary truck rolls and dispatches, getting people out in the field to do something. We've seen in certain instances we can get up to a 40% reduction there. That's real savings to the business, especially when you're sending tens of thousands of unsuccessful truck rolls out there every year. Let's dig in a little bit further. Here we've actually got a view of our Scout incident manager. This is an overview of all the incidents that are happening real time on the network at AT&T. Each incident is created from multiple different tickets and alarms. In this day you can see that we offer in the upper right hand corner over 72,000 different defects happening on the network. That's information coming in from network equipment or alarms coming in or something happening. How do we distill that into a somewhere where we can actually take action on it? When we've got it down to, there's 21 potential incidents and from there we've got the logic incorporated only nine managed incidents that now the people who operate Scout can go in and actually take a look at, figure out what to do and go make the network more resilient. Digging down even further into a single incident we get a 360 degree view of all the information that we have on that particular incident. So where it's located, what the customer is, what circuit it's actually riding on. All of it is here in one single view. I'd love to tell you that this came in, you know, just, hey, six months we're able to do this but it started three or four years ago bringing all that network information together, building an ontology around it, extending the ontology to other things and giving the foundation so we can actually take advantage of it, moving to an application where we have an actionable workflow. With the correlation automation we can actually then just see that these are just symptoms of an upstream issue. Foundry makes it extremely easy for us to develop these integrations and understand what actions that we need to take. I took one of those pieces that you saw on the previous screen and we dig down a little bit further. We've got network circuit test results. This is where we can send a signal through the circuit to determine root cause and these are things that you're usually just done automatically. We can take a look at them, understand what that cause is, send out the right person or maybe not send them out to take care of it. Last but not least, we want to take a look at our streaming data architecture. We promise we didn't steal it from racetrack. It's not the electrical schematic for the Starship enterprise. This is what actually is behind that application that we just saw. Coordinating across all those different systems, massive challenge, but we were able to do it and did it in pipeline builder. Pretty cool stuff. The latency for all this is under a minute, which includes the correlation logic, bringing all that ticket and alarm information together and going, okay, this is actually what's happening here. What it means for us, the incidents are being resolved faster and improves the experience and trust in our network for our customers. Okay, at the end here, gone from 20 million tickets a day that we have to look through and seven different circuit sources, let alone all the other inventory systems and everything we have to bring together to a consolidated view that allows us to reduce the truck rolls, reduce failed truck rolls, get the right people out there at the right time and improve our resolution time. All of it helps us deliver on the AT&T guarantee and the connectivity that you all depend on. Thank you.
