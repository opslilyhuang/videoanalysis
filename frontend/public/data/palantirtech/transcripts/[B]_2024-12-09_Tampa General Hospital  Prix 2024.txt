TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good evening everyone, my name is Zedar Hong from Tampa General Hospital and I have the great pleasure of wrapping things up and being between you guys and dinner. So hopefully I won't take too long. I'm excited to be able to share about our journey with with Palantir and what how it impacts our healthcare environments. Healthcare as you all know is littered with inefficiencies and silos. We are currently struggling with massive demand as patients are coming to the hospitals and looking for capacity for us to be able to treat them and to be able to save lives. So Tampa General is in that business to save lives and what we are limited by our systems that were designed for ineffician in ineffician era. What we've been able to do with Palantir in the last few years as we partnered with them has been transformative. What has been slow in the past to be able to develop solutions. We are seeing solutions being developed within months and days. I'd like to be able to share a specific use case. This past summer we had an incident with one of our blood vendors that supply blood products for our hospitals as well as within our region. They had a data breach that really crippled their systems and really disrupted the supply chain for blood products. What we were able to do with Palantir was quickly go in and design a system that would allow us to identify patients that needed the blood products and be able to help us prioritize who needed them first. We were able to do that within a few hours and get this thing operationalized. In my entire career I've never been able to see a system go from a concept to production level within that sort of a period of time. It's been transformative for us as we look at what we were able to do and how quickly we can change things to be able to save lives. 2025 we are looking at this as a transformative year for us as we think about the systems and the processes that we need to redesign. We look at how do we connect all the disparate data systems and the sources that we have and create a single operating system that goes beyond just any one vendor platform. Our purpose is to be able to build the best technology to be able to support efficient and effective patient care. And so what we were committed to doing is being able to push foundry in our operating system to connect all our sources and to be able to build out on tallies that would allow us to do rapid development like we did with our blood product solution. What we're also committed to doing is pushing these solutions and these technologies not just in the hands of leaders but only down to our frontline staff, our clinicians, our operators so that they can take this technology and create more effective and efficient flows to better our patients. And so we are committed to doing that and we're solidifying that by developing an innovation center for healthcare which will hopefully be coming this summer. What we're doing is co-branding it with Palantir and letting the technology drive a lot of the innovation and the development that we have using the technology and having them closer to the front lines as we design these cool systems. And so I'd like to raise a toast to all of you. You guys may or may not know this. You know as we are adopting artificial intelligence and everything we do, not just in healthcare but in all industries, you guys are pioneers, you guys are innovators, you guys are forward thinking. And it takes a special someone to be able to do that to think beyond what is the current limitations and see that there's a different solution and a different way of doing things. And so I'd like for you guys to raise your glasses and be able to toast to a transformative year for 2025 that we are, we may very well be at the crux of a massive paradigm shift that really will be once in a lifetime of an opportunity. And so I look forward to 2025 and cheers to all of you all. Thanks.
