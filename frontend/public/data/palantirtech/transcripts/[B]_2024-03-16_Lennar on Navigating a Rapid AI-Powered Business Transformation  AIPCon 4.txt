TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning. You guys should stand up and look around at how crowded this is because I think a couple of years ago is here and it was smaller, but this is humongous. And I love the quietness just to give you the feedback, Sasha, that keeping this tight like this is the way it should be done. So thank you for that. Anyway, I'm going to tell you guys a quick story about Lenar. Lenar, if you don't know, we're the biggest home builder in the country. And our business model is generally pretty simple to understand. So by land, prepare the areas that we build for construction and then build the homes and then warranty the homes. And what we're going to talk about here today is a really complex part of that process, which is what we call horizontal construction. And that's where we're preparing the land for construction. So I'm going to show you some emails here and you don't need to read these emails. Trust me. Emails are horrible. But in any case, I'm just going to kind of show you a couple things. So basically we had a guy that worked for the COO that was saying, hey, I want to buy something called quick base. And it's basically an access product. And everybody in here probably groans when they hear that word because access is not something that we want to use to feed any kind of system at all. And so basically this is one of the big problems that we face when we're doing that is you'll get like seven different bids and there will be thousands of items in these bids where you're trying to find out what's the best pricing. So we have 17,000 different communities across the country. That's a lot, right? Last year we built, we planned to build 62,000 homes. We built 73,000 homes. So that was kind of a big achievement. But there's a lot of complexity in preparing these homes for what we call that horizontal construction piece. And so the COO says to me, I don't know if we should buy the software or not. Can you talk to these guys? So we talked to them and we engaged. And then the COO sends back the thing that we all dread need speed, need this to happen fast. And that's something that is always annoying to people who deliver technology because technology doesn't usually happen that fast. But in any case, so at least Lasak is here. We sat down. We had a conversation with this guy that wanted to buy this piece of software. And we kind of listened to him, listened to the problem that he had to solve. And basically one of the problems that he has is he kind of reiterated this thing about, you know, there may be sometimes seven different bidders that provide all of these thousands of bids per item. So when you think about like a new home, sometimes there's manhole covers, there's two by fours, there's I mean, there's plumbing, there's electricity, there's all the stuff that goes in and it literally is thousands of lines. And these guys were doing this on spreadsheets, which you know, by the way, I have shirts that say, did you not know Excel is dead? But in any case, we thought, my God, and so as we kind of walk through this whole process with him, we thought, geez, this is really the ultimate case for foundry. And we just kind of looked at each other and were like, why not foundry? This is perfect use case. And this is a great way to bring in Palantir to Lunar. I had I spoke here a few years back and we did a big transformation where I was the CTO at Tyson Foods and we took $700 million of the cost out using foundry, which is pretty, pretty epic. So I had a lot of confidence in that. And you guys have all probably learned about foundry. But we started to work, we bought Palantir in, we had in 51 days felt like we're ready to now show these guys what foundry can do, what Palantir can do. And so we sat down, we asked for 40 minutes to give this demo. They said, well, you're going to get 20. That's classic, right? That's what we all live with. So we started giving the demo. Actually, Milo, who's here, was the one that was doing the demo. And it was totally quiet for 14 minutes. People were just like kind of an awe. And then while this slide says there was an eruption, the real word is all total hell broke loose. Because people were just completely couldn't believe what they had seen. Because you're basically looking through all that data. And it's showing literally that across 17,000 different communities, when you're preparing land for construction, that you're saving anywhere between two and a half million to up to $8 million per each of those communities. It's a big deal when you think about the scale of 73,000 homes. And basically, what made us feel great is that that COO said, it's amazing that after only 51 days, you all have changed the complete idea of technology delivery here at Lennar. Because we've never seen anything like this. We've got an LLM in there, or we have AI running in there. All this is running. And it's basically using the LLM to create an email to just go back to each of those bitters and say, we think you can do better on this mini-pricing items. Because somebody else had a lower price. And that's just fantastic. So that for us was huge. And I think Lennar has a different level of confidence. And so my final thing that I would say is just get started. If you haven't considered, if you're a customer in here and you're thinking about using Lennar, feel free to give me a call. Because I can tell you what, the velocity that you're going to get, the intellect of the people that are there, the amount of learning that they're going to do as far as the business case goes, is like you've never seen before. So that's my story. Thank you guys for being here and enjoy Foundry. Excuse me, AI, be kind.
