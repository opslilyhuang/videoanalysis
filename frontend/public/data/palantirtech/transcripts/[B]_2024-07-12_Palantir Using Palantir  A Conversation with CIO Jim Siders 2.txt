TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm Chad Wolk, West. I'm an architect here at Palantir. One of the questions I get the most is, does Palantir actually use our own software to run our business? We tell you all these great things you can do with it. How do we use it? So I thought I'd go to the source of the truth here. We've got Jim Siders here, our CIO from Palantir. Thanks for joining me today. Thanks for having me. This is awesome. So maybe you've been here quite a while. Maybe you could share a little background of what you've been doing. Yeah, I've been at Palantir since 2013. February of 2013. I joined as a temp contractor in the IT support help desk. In 2015, I moved to Palo Alto, which was then our headquarters, to be the first person in the company you spent all their time developing on Palantir internal tools for internal workflows at Palantir. Wow. I mean, I think that's where a lot of mythologies, like, oh, Palantir, they must have this crazy different system. But to start, we had an IT department just like everybody else. We had existing source system records. We didn't have found anything. So we were just a normal IT shop building software. And so I think that's the interesting part about your stories. We were like everybody else. We are, in a lot of ways, we're both very like everybody else and very not. In 2014, 15, we were doing the same transformation that a lot of companies were at that time. We were becoming AWS first. We were becoming SaaS oriented across most of our systems of record in the enterprise. And now we're doing what a lot of other companies are doing also, which is realizing that that model doesn't scale terribly well. It doesn't lend itself terribly well to agility and affordability and the ability to iterate quickly over time. Fortunately, now, foundries a thing when it wasn't then. All of the things that have become buzzwords in IT over the last few years democratize delivery and optimizing value chains in different ways. Pushing things to the edge of the organization foundries built for that. It's honestly the best thing we could use. And I can only use the best things I can use. I don't get a freebie for using Foundry. It's just the best thing that I need it. Yeah. And I mean, I got to come back to I get a lot of questions of like, wow, this can do so much. You know, when should I use it? When should I not use it? Well, I already have this data warehouse tool and I already have this ERP. And I think that's the interesting story too is, you know, let's use the systems in the right way. This is their design. So if I've got a good ERP, okay, let's not reinvent the wheel. Let's use that and use Foundry to build that customization because we can move quickly. I think maybe a little bit on, you know, the story you have around how we pick when we use Foundry or not or even around how, you know, the right way to use it, I think is a big thing we get a lot of questions on. You know, the right way for us, you know, you gave me a great segue there. There's going to be systems that just still exist, right? Like if a giant company has spent many years trying to figure out how to be an excellent ERP in terms of really trustworthy general ledger transactions, I don't want to reinvent the wheel there. Right? Auditors already understand how to deal with that. Investors already understand how to deal with that. But our company isn't shaped to engage with a tool like that, the way that tool wants us to, if that tool even has an opinion at all. Like, we need to run the business in a way that's relevant for our business. So that's where the autology comes in. It's like the definition of shaped the way our business is. It's objects, they're semantically linked to how we actually do things. So instead of trying to use our ERP's expense tracking methodology, our group internally spun up a tool called Rocket, which is a suite of tools and dashboards that let our business manage expense in a way that's relevant for our business. And it's fueled record setting excellent expense management over the last few years. It's really contributed to our bottom line. I think maybe a little bit on your decision-making process about how and when and where to use the tools. Yeah, you know, we sort of joke internally where an and company, not an or company, you know, that like a fast cheap secure you can only pick two is out the window. For us, our the business I support won't accept it. So we need a situation where you have data layer that aligns with good governance and good compliance that is compatible with people at the edge of the organization being empowered to solve their own problems in a world where the where the easiest thing has to be the right thing from a compliance or security perspective. And then you set people free on objects that really semantically, accurately represent how you run your business, let them solve their own problems instead of placing orders at the IT snack bar. Yeah, I think you're going to point on that generating value over time. I think it's the flywheel effect that you're about all the time. Yes. Okay, I built these semantic objects. I have the people component. I have this sort of component that then allows you to build the next use case next use. So there's kind of that compounding value. Have you seen that? Was your deploying this? Tons. All the time actually. You know, one of the things that I love about using foundry as a process orchestration or ticketing system is that it encourages the dissolution of silos in an or rather than the strengthening of them. You have a lot of like name your trouble ticketing or process automation suite. It tends to keep whatever optimization is created within the part of the org that created it. And obviously everybody will like sell you like a bolt on thing to like make turn that into a shareable something something up goes to your your integration layer. The only right way to use foundry is doing that by default. So for example, the recruiting organization and people ops felt that it was really wasteful in time consuming the process between when a hiring manager says yes to hiring a candidate and the time that person starts at the company. There's too many people too many workflows too many processes involved. So they encoded that in a foundry layer to orchestrate those processes. A lot of the primitives that they had to come up with in the course of that work were noticed by the folks who run the off boarding process when somebody decides to leave the company. There's a whole other set of workflows. They didn't want to stand in line and wait for developers to build that stuff for them. So those folks in the people ops organization built their own tool kind of without really anybody even knowing and then brought it to me to the security organization to internal audit and said can we use this in production and its production ready. It was production quality right out of the gate because they knew the problem space better than anybody else. Yeah that's fascinating. So I think that comes back to the the value creation component. Now like okay you've got you're talking about these builders. Maybe we could hit on the point of I'm changing the outcomes for people that are building this platform because they're now focused instead of on IT stack. They're focused on value delivery for the business. Yes. How is that transition and how are they doing? Like have we added headcount to do this? Like what are we what are we doing in that transition from a change management? You know any person who runs an IT org is going to put up their hand and say they want to increase their headcount I think. But no actually we haven't. The key for us was AIP. Yeah. It lets people with existing expertise be functional in a platform that they're just learning and it forces them in a way to think about the fundamentals of what they're trying to do there which aligns you with value by default. Right. You can't be thinking about the constructs that exist in whatever this proprietary system is. You have to be asking AIP assist or whatever the thing is you're addressing. How do I get this thing done? I want to accomplish this outcome. Here's how I would accomplish it in the platform I understand. How would I accomplish it here? Yeah and I guess what's the take from these employees as they're you know learning these tools sets. I know some people from a change management point hey this is my baby this is my tool I built my 20 year career on being this expert for this totally. How have they adopted? Because I think that's a lot of fear from IT managers standpoint is like I love this tool I love the direction but now how do I get people to add value? I had a lot of trepidation about that. When we first kicked off trying to start this flywheel spinning it's how is somebody who works on mule soft all day going to respond to me asking them to think about foundry instead? And honestly in almost every case people embraced it because they tend to know the systems that they've specialized in really really well that makes them really familiar with the shortcomings of those systems too. They're like the frustration with the pace of development at the manufacturer or whatever right. Everybody knows that the support desk at whatever their platform company is terrible they don't want to get in line there. What if they could just do that themselves? That would be insane. Yeah. Nobody went into these careers like wanting to sit in line at some support desk. They like wanted to help the business they were passionate about something about the problem space for the solutions. Yeah. It set them all free and honestly the bigger challenge has been for me trying to gate things from rushing to production like making sure that we were checking all the boxes for internal audit and finance and security and legal because all of the actual engineers in IT and all the other internal teams are just like drunk on the Kool-Aid. They just like want to go do the thing and they're finally getting to go do the thing. You know one of our finance tooling engineers came up with a way to reduce cycle time on expense allocations as part of our monthly closing the book every month month and then close to reduce the cycle time on that from about 12 hours to something like five to seven minutes. Wow. And the worst pressure that I've gotten from anything in the last year of my life at Palantir has been people demanding that we put that in production faster. Like how do we get it through audit faster? When we're talking about this making me think because we're transforming our internal teams to builders which comes with build with AIP absolutely now and so just like we are taking our way of operating encoding the product now also with AIP now and build with AIP we are taking that same build mentality that we're seeing internally and then giving that to our customers absolutely now we've got build camps so now that we're going to have people in their building with us they people can sign up for their own accounts and log in which is that whole build or mentality which I think is what we're seeing the magic here is like how to spring that magic to everybody right? Absolutely our internal teams as those other new efforts launched were coming to me on a daily basis going how do we get this idea of hours in the market place to make sure that people all over the place can get it. It's like that's a really cool dynamic where people connect with the upside of the business in a way that normally in our teams it doesn't happen. So this is exciting I love all the journey how kind of we got to where we are and what we're doing. What's next? What do you see on the horizon? It feels like the flywheel's really just spinning now like I think I think this is the beginning. We're just now at the beginning of a multi-year project to deprecate one of the industry leading ticketing knowledge management systems in favor of internally sourced Foundry. We're in the process of deprecating our middleware layer between our ERPs to replace it with orchestrating all of those transactions with Foundry. We're in the process of moving away from the industry leading SIMSource solution in favor of Foundry. We have AI agents that are doing ticket routing across all of our ticketing work streams across all of our recruiting work streams and we're just getting started. Thanks for joining me today. I really enjoyed the conversation just a couple IT guys talking shop here in Arkansas. I loved it. So again thanks for traveling and joining me here. Absolutely thanks for having me. We all joined Palantir because we love the company, love the mission. It's just I'm fired up to get the word out so thanks for the opportunity.
