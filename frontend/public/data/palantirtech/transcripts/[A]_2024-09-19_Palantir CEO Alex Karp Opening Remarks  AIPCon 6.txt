TRANSCRIPT

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. On all other days I would talk about our AIP prowess or foundry or maybe even our government products and there's some things I'd like to say there and welcome obviously all of you, who don't want to live in a view presenting actual things done in pound-year products. We have our leader of our retail movement here which is important but this, for whatever reason this was scheduled right before probably the largest event that has ever happened to our company and we've had some pretty interesting events. You know, first of all we survived. Most Silicon Valley companies do not survive. We focused on how institutions ought to run and build software products around that starting with clandestine services, moving into spec ops, moving into the battlefield, moving into commercial and these products have materially changed the course of society. We, DPO'd which is a fancy way of saying we didn't give the bankers all the money. We transferred it to loyal individual investors which is part of the reason we have so many supporters and yet no one thought we would be profitable on a free cash flow basis or that we'd be get profitable and the idea that we could be in this exclusive club of the S&P 500 was something that believed me. Everyone internally is like okay I'll just shut up about this idea this is too much. No way we're going to get this to work and it worked and for us this is just like at Pound Chair it is just arguably the biggest event that has happened to us because you know it's just you are actually a real serious company and it was done on the back of products that are powerful enough that we could keep the company the same size and increase the number of partners we have and the revenue. And I would say while getting on the S&P we stay true to our values that's kind of obvious and sometimes annoying to our partners because we have to speak about certain truths that maybe aren't popular but it doesn't make them less true. But we also have the very best partners in the world. Pound Chair over a course of 20 years there have been two things that have been true. We have the very best people. The Pound Chair degree now is the most important degree in intact bar none. People now if make sure we get people or mission aligned because we have so many people just want to join so they can become famous. And then we've had the best the very best partners. I hate the term clients but the fact owe clients and obviously we could go through the government clients were allowed to acknowledge and they are the most elite in the world. But I would say our commercial partners as witnessed here and the people presenting are the most interesting, most dynamic, most in general, highest integrity, commercial partners that you will ever meet. The people running them who purchased our products, the people who are supporting the people running and doing their own thing and IT, engineering, production, marketing, have one thing in common which is I need my business to work better and I'm going to look at the product and I'm not going to look at the state dinner. And that's how we ended up with the best people and the best customers and the best use cases. And of course that is just the massive structural advantage and that was in advance before you got to AI. But what is the large language model, by the way, is a kind of non-sequitur. I'm not sure what the person or partner from US government is going to say today because I didn't even know we were allowed to talk about this stuff but I'm really excited that we can have a vignette into that. I will see what we're allowed to know. But that's super cool. But then if you have this revolution, large language and algorithmatic, in the US government it's more in general, more algorithm than large language model. But it is a weird revolution because in a normal revolution you have lots and lots of startups and they get one or two get all the value. In this revolution you have the large language models and AI have to be processed in an enterprise. And what that basically means is enterprises with high business acumen and high talent can raise their game and become essentially the startup that would have disrupted them and disrupt the startups. So it's like an incredible time to be you and arguably not as good a time to be a venture investor. It's great to be us, it's great to be you because the intermediate of large language models is how do you process them? How do you fix your margins? How do you turn your company into a portfolio? How do you understand where the risk allocation is? The capital allocation? How do you turn your non-engineers into engineers? How do you disrupt the distribution? How do you make up for distribution? One distribution has capital costs, the nature of political uncertainty disrupts your products. All these things are solvable in with our product, your business acumen, your data, your way of going to business and you can accelerate them. And it's that acceleration that is going to drive our partners to what I view is going to happen to us which has become stronger, bigger, more successful and actually happier because you do not want your best workers working on things that they don't enjoy, that there's no point in doing where they're not productive, where they can't prove the results, where the margin changes aren't actually showing up on the bottom line. And all those things are possible with our product and with you and it's just an incredibly exciting time. But again, the most exciting thing for me and I'm very happy to have you guys here are this is probably going to be an AIP con that's part work and quite frankly you may see them parting, surprise they're even awake, you know, it's like you know, pound tunes don't really get the opportunity to party. High school didn't work, no one would party with us. College, college, you were busy trying to get into pound year and then you have to work and work and we had a DPO but no one really thought that was going to work so there was so much of a surprise that there was no partying. So now, you know, if they're slightly slower, slightly inebriated, forgive them, enjoy the vibe. It's a rare time for us and we're going to be back to crushing it with less alcohol and other things. Yeah, we don't, it's like sex drugs and rock and roll but we don't really have any of them. But we do have a great product, it's a great product. You don't need any of that stuff. The product makes up for it, it's the size of the product that matters. And so any case with that, welcome to what I think will be a really cool time. I am exceedingly happy to have you. I'm exceedingly happy currently just in general because of the SAP S&P admission and other things and having you and having 111 people actually show things that are working and I hope you have a good time and come back. Take care.
