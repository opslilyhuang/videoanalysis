================================================================================

Hello, I'm from Japan and I see is the automotive parts company doing doors every open closed item of the doors and the transmission breaks, hybrids and the battery exos and whatsoever. A kind of vacation, so many products. But I was five years of the Chief Software Digital Officer for that company on the group and struggled to unify the global management because previous days we were almost 190 subsidiary companies. These companies has its own king, selfish. And I was trying to use Palantir for democratized these. And the 590 companies are its own dedicated products. Transmission specialists, door specialists means every company has a different KPIs. But as you may know, all the industry is facing significant change. Go for electric. Some of them can use Tesla cars or battery cars very popular in China. We have to compete with these. Then we need the power units, all the groups. Therefore, I'd like to use Palantir as a technology weapon to unite the group companies. And some of the POC, then in America, are now trying to go for different countries. I've been succeeded by some very nice engineer, quick and reasonable and affordable and understandable. And I think we, and the company, will be old together to meet the future target. We're going to be a portfolio change, as you can know that we were a transmission company. Transmission will not need any more in the near future. And we have studied electric models, electric systems, like almost 10% of their products is now going for electrics. Together with all the companies. And the same time, we have to change our need time towards the production. Previous days, we need two or three years to develop units. But we need agility. Right now, new units, done in check-all and China at the same time. New butler frames, necessary in states and other places like Thailand. So to make this possible, we'd like to use Palantir to acknowledge as much as possible. Thank you very much for this opportunity. Thank you.
