Please welcome head of AI go to market at Palantir Jack Dobson. Hello and welcome to Palantir Paragon. As we round out another year of AIP I wanted to take this opportunity to share the latest of how Palantir customers are further pushing the perimeter of enterprise autonomy. Palantir is the operating system for mission critical decision making with the world's foremost organizations running agentic operations across the fabric of the business by their own unique ontology. The criticality and complexity of our customers operations has affirmed human AI teaming as the optimal approach to enabling enterprise autonomy. By having AI agents and human users operate in the same shared decision space of the ontology, AIP enables the frontline operator to focus their time on only the most critical of decisions that uniquely require their expertise, intuition and experience. Our focus of the last few months has been a relentless pursuit of that goal. How do we progressively increase the breadth and depth of automation across the enterprise consuming more and more of the operational edge cases that still draw vital operator time away from what matters most? These edge cases are often due to a reliance on knowledge or logic that exists only in the minds of our operators, the undocumented, unwritten logic that actually dictates much of your operations on the ground. As operators make decisions in Palantir through continual capture of operator action logs in the ontology, we can incorporate these edge cases and close the gap with AIP further freeing the operator to focus only on what is critical. And I'm excited to share this for the first time today. But let's start by laying the foundation returning to Onyx Incorporated, a global medical products manufacturer and distributor. Our journey starts with enterprise OS, the front end for my connected value chain. Here I can monitor the real time operations of my enterprise from the status of inventory distribution across my supply chain right down to the real time telemetry streaming off of my production lines. It's the ability to take that level of depth and fidelity and extend it across the breadth of the value chain that sets Onyx apart. The ontology extends the full chain from raw material sourcing to manufacturing onto distribution and the ultimate delivery of our products to customers. And that ontology forms a foundation of countless use cases from predictive maintenance and yield optimization on production lines to cost of goods sold and inventory balancing for finished goods to KYC, customer service and lead gen across the customer base. Each of these workflows don't just provide analysis, insight or visibility, they enable operational decision making across their respective teams and business functions. And critically, being built on the ontology, each of these workflows are driven with human AI teaming at their core. Look to the action feed on the right of the screen. These are the real time alerts and events flowing in across the business and different business functions across my enterprise. Each instantly triggering AIP agents to execute a resolution before any downstream impact occurs. Switching over to the automation hub, we see this event feed broken out into the different workflows running in real time across the org. There are core workflows across the value chain of my business, order fulfillment, the journey of every customer order from inception to inventory management to the logistics of final delivery to the customer. Internally, we have maintenance workflows, deploying technicians to different locations to ensure all of our production lines are running optimally and operationally. And the list goes on to further use cases across my value chain. So traditionally, these functions would all be purely human driven with the various primitives like orders, maintenance tickets and support issues being manually pushed through cues across the market. And the list goes on to further use cases across different operators and teams. AIP instead sets automation at the core of these functions. We're fundamentally running our business, redefining our processes from first principles, built on a limitlessly scalable resource of AI agents, freeing up the frontline operator to act only on the most valuable, critical or complex of decisions. Every operator action, we capture the necessary context and logic that could fuel automation of that intervention in the future. More on that in a little bit. But let's dive deeper into order fulfillment to show how different user personas interact with this workflow. So by jumping one level down into my operations, I take on the role of my fulfillment lead. We unlock a new level of granularity where now we can monitor the network at the individual order level. With every single order modeled in my ontology, we contract the movement of these orders through their various states and then aggregate that movement up at any level of granularity to take action. So we have a distribution center level, reviewing performance across my critical hubs, right down to the order status level. Here we can see the breadth of human AI teaming across the network with each node of the process running at different levels of automation. But as we talk about automation, what does it actually mean to have our operators working alongside our automated agents? Well, let's go one level deeper still to the operational applications deployed to the front line. A new application bespoke for a new set of users all built on the same connected ontology. We've gone from the entire value chain down to my global inventory distribution network, now down to one single distribution center, for which I now take on the role of a materials manager, responsible for allocating the inventory across the thousands of customer orders, this DC fulfills. This process is a critical part of the decision chain, one that's preceded by steps of order review and validation, and then followed by downstream steps like delivery logistics and customer service. The optimal fulfillment process requires tight coordination across these stages to optimize for on time and in full delivery. With AIP, that coordination no longer relies purely on the handoff across different human operators. The process is infused with AI agents, triggered by automations that cover an ever increasing breadth of criteria, ensuring that every order is carried optimally through the process, and our people are laser focused only on what requires their unique attention. Here we see the coalescing of agent automations and the orders that drop out of the queue into my action list, out of thousands of orders flowing through each day, only a handful now require my attention. This is a step change in how every single one of my distribution centers operate. Briefly dipping one level under the hood, we see how my ontology uniquely powers this human AI teaming. This agent is defined in AIP logic, a tool for building, testing and deploying agents across my enterprise. In amongst my custom business logic, you can see that this agent is able to wield the same ontology primitives as my human operators. The same object types, the same functions, the same actions, all tools shared between humans and AI. And of course, no production deployment is possible without the ability to evaluate the execution and the output of our agents. AIP logic is tightly coupled with AIP evals, allowing me to monitor the performance of every single agent, test across multiple different underlying models and make informed version controlled improvements over time. So zooming back out from the agents orchestrating this process, let's switch focus to the human operator, looking into these orders that have actually been deemed by our agents to uniquely require my attention. Critically, I'm not left to fly solo in taking action here. Agents will provide me with proposed actions, proactively gathering all the relevant context from my ontology and giving me the visibility into the steps on this order's journey so far. Action logs will coalesce the human and AI actions across the full history of this particular order. This kind of seamless teaming across the value chain is only made possible by the ontology of shared data, logic and action between agents and human operators. So AIP has assisted me in pulling my workload down to only the subset of actions that require my attention. It's then saved significant time in actually understanding and resolving the issue while presenting valuable context that materially improves the quality of my solution. But then we actually have to enact that decision, a process which historically would also involve swivel chairing across multiple tools, systems and stakeholders. I have to update my ERP, my product picking schedule, my delivery manifests, my time sheets and so on. So here, the action layer of the ontology proves invaluable. Right back actions allow me to update these systems simultaneously with one click, orchestrating updates across my architecture with specific connections configurable for my unique landscape, via API, web hooks or out of the box connectors. But a reminder, the goal here is to only involve the human when their input is explicitly required. So in reality, these user required actions aren't just a simple review and approve. Our operators, they hold a wealth of unique context and experience that doesn't exist in any doc system or data source. And therefore, is not available to our AI agents. It's that tribal knowledge, that logic that can materially influence a given decision. So of course, the same ontology tools we see here that were available to our AIP agents can also be picked up by our human operators to make manual edits and to self-solve the most complex issues. These are the actions that my people's time is best allocated against. And critically, the ontology offers us an opportunity not to lose those actions as exhaust into the enterprise, but to instead capture it with the context that informs those actions. Deviating from an agent recommended action alone is captured as implicit feedback. But this user provided commentary, access and explicit feedback to guide future agent decisioning. This knowledge capture is happening constantly across my value chain. But that requires the flexibility to meet every operator where they are, to address the specific needs of every single use case. So with that in mind, we're actually going to jump laterally to another one of these workflows. In this case, upstream of order fulfillment. We're moving from the distribution center to the factory floor. These same core primitives introduced at the DC are also supporting maintenance technicians on the production line. My operators are again working in cohesion with a cohort of context specific agents provided with tools critical to maximizing production up time. Anomaly detection models running across all machine telemetry, multi-variate predictive maintenance with the ontology actions to schedule future work orders. The chain agent process here will proactively identify issues, check documentation and past maintenance resolutions to inform course of action, and then actually schedule the optimal technician based on their appropriate skill set, their experience with past issues, and of course their availability. And only then will we inject that allocated technician to take action, all of which can now happen in a matter of seconds, where previously this issue risk sitting unaddressed for weeks. And when it comes to taking that action, the technician is supported by the rich diverse set of context relevant to this issue and the impacted machine. The specific location of the part at fault, telemetry related to that part and the broader machine, documentation, past maintenance records, once again it's not just providing context to the operator but synthesizing it into a recommended action to maximize every minute spent on the line. The same core primitives of not just data but decisions, not just analytics but actions, all made possible by workflows shaped to the needs of the operator, rather than forcing them to conform to the limitations of their architecture. So as we increase the breadth and depth of automation across the enterprise, we're increasingly eating away at those operational edge cases that incur friction on my business, the events, disruptions and adverse conditions that still require human intervention to resolve. Palantite customers are leveraging AIP to continually identify the opportunities to eat away at such edge cases, identifying the increasingly granular problem scenarios that are necessarily still draw on their operator's time across the value chain. We need to be able to track where these negative scenarios are arising, how users are responding and resolving and then actually feed this back into the machine to continually push our ability to catch and autonomously mitigate such events in the future. This approach demands an ontology. So let's look at it in action. We've seen two examples of operator workflows where the user can inject relevant context, intuition, logic that enables them to solve for one of these edge cases. And in both cases, we capture context as explicit feedback. Well, as we zoom out, this isn't just two workflows. This is hundreds across the value chain. It isn't just two operators. It's tens of thousands across the globe. If we're tracking these actions at scale, regardless of user, location or problem scenario, think how many needles in the operational haystack we can uncover. Action logs have been generated across my enterprise on a constant basis. Every piece of context previously lost as decision exhaust is now captured and synthesized into proposals. These proposals capture the patterns you would never spot. The scenarios that, while very specific and even sometimes non-frequent at the local level, globally, they actually incur days of operator pain, thousands of orders being delayed and hours. The ontology allows us to break out of the local optimer and monitor the enterprise at scale where disparate data sources, unique processes and siloed teams made this previously impossible. So here I'm taking on the role of a process architect at Onyx, responsible for evaluating these optimization proposals and determining the course of action. Much like our operator workflows earlier on, jumping into one of these proposals presents me with all of the context that I need to inform my decision, right down to the individual action logs that informed this optimization. And the logic agent that actually mined them into this proposal. It's important to stress the level of cross system optimization we're achieving here. The conditions under which this particular bottleneck might occur have cropped up hundreds of times, but critically across multiple separate branches of my ontology. What that means in practice, if we look at our geospatial view, hundreds of users across multiple DCs all powering through the pain to get the job done, but this pain is not being communicated across the network. Siloed operator friction of this scale can quickly grow to be an existential disease. The operator solution to these problems is complex, but it's repeatable. So this is an AIP automate can catch these conditions when they arise and an AIP logic defined agent can execute a solution. Applying the learned behaviors from those operator logs translated into logic to resolve the situation autonomously. I'm trying to find the optimization as a win, but we're still at risk of a capacity constraint on engineering time. I'm limited to how many of these optimizations I have engineers available to implement. We've shifted the bottleneck from the problem to an incapacity to keep up with building the solutions. Well, our journey doesn't end here. As much as our AIP agents wielded the same ontology as our operators, AIFDE can wield the same platform tools as our engineers to take this proposal to actually build against it in just a couple of clicks. So we've got to start from data transformation to ontology building to function authoring and OSDK all tools that AIFDE can now wield to get this proposal into production. And then for larger scale changes, graduating from new agents to entire new workflows, AI hive mind spins up a set a team of AI agents to decomp my problem, to research approaches to solving, to model and test solutions, and critique those proposals using self-generated evaluation criteria. Days, weeks worth of research, deliberation, review, and consolidation collapsed into minutes, with the ability to immediately graduate the proposed build to AIFDE. AIFDE hive mind and the broader suite that I've run through today are all a monumental step change in our ability to build against the ever-changing enterprise landscape wielding the context and the tools of my business to achieve enterprise autonomy. This is the foundation of the self-healing enterprise. And it's all ready for you to start building today. So let's get started. Thank you very much. Thanks for watching.
