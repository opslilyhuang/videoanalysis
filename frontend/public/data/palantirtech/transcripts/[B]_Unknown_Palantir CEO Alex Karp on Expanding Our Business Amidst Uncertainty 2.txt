TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The Pallantier began its journey with the idea that the world could be made better even as the developments were radically changing the world for the worse, more violence, more chaos, more economic despair. We've built some of the most unique products in the world that deal with these issues. And currently we are looking at the world as a place where we can do even more to emigrate some of the ill on all fronts. And because of that we are expanding Pallantier and looking to aggressively hire future palanterians. Palanterians are eclectic, interesting, unique among the most talented people in the world and need a very specialized environment for building enterprise software products that quite literally are playing a decisive role in nearly every aspect of people's lives in the West from pushing back against invasions to immemureating the consequences of a pandemic to rebuilding supply chains. We're also known for having simply the most interesting and smartest people in the world. So for anyone who's interested in being part of this culture and a special shout out to those of you who are part of that culture, meaning ex-pallantarians, some of the best if not most of the best software engineers in the world involved in enterprise software are either at Palantier or we're at Palantier. And as former Palantarians you know having done interesting things outside of Palantier that there are some things that you can do outside of Palantier that are really cool, but there are also some things that can only be done at Palantier. And if you're interested in rejoining our Hobbit colony, please let us know. And thank you.
