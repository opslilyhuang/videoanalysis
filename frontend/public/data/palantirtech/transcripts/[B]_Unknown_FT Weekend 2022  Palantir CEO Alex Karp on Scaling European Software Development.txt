So, all right. So, most of the room without knowing it actually have benefited from Palantir by getting your vaccine. By the way, I shall say if anyone's standing at the back and wants to sit down, do come forward because they're still spaced around the front around the stage if it would be more comfortable for you. But I guess one question I have is this, you know, one of the other things that concerns many European politicians and voters is this perception that Silicon Valley or Denver is so far ahead of Europe in terms of the capability that essentially Europeans are being forced to put their trust into American companies. Is there any company in Britain which could do what you're doing with data analytics? Or do you think you're just way ahead of anything that the UK can offer? Well, we believe quite we believe we build products five years before the rest of the world believes are useful. We've seen this in PGA, we've seen it in our products we've built. And so, I don't I wouldn't say UK and on UK we believe we're five years ahead of the products in America. America is the dominant tech community in the world. I believe that's that's also a problem. And one of the reasons we have our largest office and the core development of the Foundry product that is being used pretty widely in England and in Europe both in civilian and non-civilian context is I'm putting my, you know, we're investing in part but not only and we have our own interest. London is a great place to recruit and retain town, international talent has been a bananza for us on that front but also because it is a real problem for the world order where, and by the way, it's not even America. It's the west coast of America. You have a tiny sliver of the world producing most of the great tech companies. We believe we're ahead of those tech companies in our software capabilities, the whole stack. So, pipeline in the data all the way up to operational uses. But I very much believe this is something that, you know, we have some of our best engineers from England. We're scaling in England. One of the reasons I'm here quite frankly is not, it's not what you're a recruitment recruitment drive. Anyone's got any kids need a job? We are very interested in recruiting and retaining and we have 800 of our 3200 people are sitting in London and that's likely to increase because it's just a beacon for talent.
