TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right. I think this is the last part of the session. So we'll kick it off. Lars Avis, CTO at DTN. DTN is a data analytics company that provides operational insights for our customers that primarily operate in the energy space, the agriculture space in the water-impacted spaces. Think of it as a company that provides predictive modeling at GNI, things of that nature that really address the operational aspects of our customers. So supply and demand, in the weather case, it could be wetter impact of storms on power lines, things of that nature. So as you can imagine, very data intensive, very AI-intensive. And what brought us here, and what I'm on stage, I guess, right now is it's because we learned in the process that it is a whole lot easier for us to focus on what we're good at, which is the data that we have, the proprietary data sets, our industry expertise. And not so much us focusing on what I call the plumbing. Sorry, no offense there, but the underlying technology that Palantir is absolutely the best at, right? And so we've been starting this journey together with Palantir not that long ago, September of this year. And within the record speed, we've actually managed to build some serious applications with them. And I think Raghu, you have a similar experience. Yeah, thanks, Lars. Velocity clinical research is world's largest clinical research site organization. If you have ever taken a medication, most likely, the clinical trial that ensures the efficacy and safety of that drug is done at one of the sites like ours. My role is to help build advanced technology solutions for velocity to scale our research across the world. Our vision is simple and bold. It's to help deliver the research to most people in the world. But in order for us to do that, our today's inefficiencies are really limiting us. We realized any given day, we're working with 20 plus disconnected systems where our clinicians and physicians are having to work manual processes in addition to taking care of the participants. That's where we realized we need a platform like Palantir to help us address the disconnectedness and build some intelligence and automation. We just had a one small project which very well resonates with the current theme. In six weeks, we were able to automate two different disconnected systems with large data and identified a million dollars that we were leaving on the table. We like the successor. We are looking for a lot more. And hopefully next year we'll do a lot more with Palantir. And Lars, you have a few more of those stories. Very similar stories, right? So effectively, I think Alex said it really well earlier today. Companies like all of us here present should really be able to focus on our core business and accelerate at what we do best. And ultimately, with Palantir, that's what we've been able to do, right? We were able to build, as I said, two major platforms, intelligent platforms with both of our major spaces that we operate in for our customers. And we've been able to build them with a handful of engineers in Palantir help in a couple of a few months. Now, there are LA right now, limited availability, but it's fantastic and phenomenal how fast we were able to move. And that's just the beginning of it, right? And ultimately, I think what it comes down to for all of us in the room is that data is key. We know that, but unlocking the power of data is really where it lies. And if you're too worried about it, and we were worried about a lot about data pipelining and transformations and getting it all into a shape where we can do anything with the data, well, that's all energy that you're losing on the actual solution that you're trying to build for your customers and addressing customer problems. That is what we need to be about. And that is what Palantir has enabled us to be much and focused on. And we're super excited about it and can't wait to see what the future holds. And I think you're in the same spot. Exactly. We have lofty goals over the next five years, and we will not back off on not reaching out them. And this partnership of Velocity's research and scale and Palantir's platform is poised to reshape how clinical research is done. And we're super excited about it. And lastly, fortune, when it comes to clinical research, if it's done faster, is really saving more lives. And we really want to do it. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.
