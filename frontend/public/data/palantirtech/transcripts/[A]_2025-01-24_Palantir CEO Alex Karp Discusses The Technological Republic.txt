TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The West must defend itself. Twenty years ago, this was like from Mars Freak Show, all these views. The West must defend itself. The best the people producing this thing called software must be aligned with our government. We should not allow institutions, software institutions to sell to our adversaries, but not sell to the US government. The world will become disjointed and more violent. An entire generation of extraordinarily talented engineer in Silicon Valley will not hesitate to dedicate their working lives to building online shopping algorithms. The consumer apps on our phone, but when a US Marine asks for a better software system, they hesitate. So much talent, so much funding in the valley has rushed toward the consumer. At the expense of what we would argue are more significant projects from national defense to local law enforcement, healthcare education. The question is, where do we want the resources of our country and our civilization to go? The way you dominate the future is you dominate the present. I want America to be American in a thousand years. You know, the book at its core is a call for us to reassess the value of concepts of national identity, of a shared culture which will be essential for this country to remain as dominant in this century as it was in the last. It was a culture that absolutely won the last World War and it will be a culture that either wins or prevents the next one. Americans are the most loving, god-fearing, fair, least discriminatory people on the planet. And they want to know that if you're waking up and thinking about harming American citizens or if American citizens are taken hostage and kept in dungeons, or if you're a foreign power sending fentanyl to poison our people, something really bad is going to happen to you and your friends and your cousins and your bank account and your mistress and whoever it was involved. There is basically no conflict in the world that where western allies are involved in the world. There is basically no conflict in the world that where western allies are involved in the battlefields involved in the stakes of our life and death where Palantir is not the first call. Everyone.
