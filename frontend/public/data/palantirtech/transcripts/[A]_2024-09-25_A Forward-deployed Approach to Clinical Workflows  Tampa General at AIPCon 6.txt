TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We're super excited to be here and talk about the work we do with PoundTier, specifically in the healthcare space. I'm Dr. Peggy Duggan, the chief medical officer at Tampa General Hospital with me is Dr. Laura Hobner, who will come along in a little later in the discussion and show our demonstration. So we're here to talk to you about a sepsis program that we built out in a very short span of time with our partners at PoundTier that's saving lives every day at Tampa General Hospital. But before we get there, let's tell you a little bit about where we work. Tampa General is a large academic health system in West Central Florida, where our only academic health system in our region, which creates a real burden and importance for us to be there for the patients who need us. We're a six hospital system, a thousand bed academic hospital, three community hospitals and two specialty hospitals, and a full suite of ambulatory services across the state of Florida from walk-in clinics, urgent cares, primary care to complex outpatient care. So everything you can imagine a patient needs, they can receive a Tampa General. What I love about the partnership with PoundTier is the alignment with our shared-perchive purpose and our vision. So at Tampa General, we say we're here, we heal, we teach, and we innovate, and we care for everyone every day. Our vision is that we will be the safest and most innovative academic health system in America. Both of those things align beautifully with the work we're doing with PoundTier. So we're going to talk about sepsis, and I'm going to explain a little bit, especially to the non-healthcare people what sepsis is. So sepsis is a severe immune response to a blood-borne infection. What that means is when you have a blood infection in your body, your systems go into overdrive to try to protect you from that infection. It's a bit of a war inside of you, and everything is being shunted to prevent that infection from worsening, but it's starving the rest of your body for the things that it needs. So less oxygen to organs, less blood supply, and then the organs start to fail and shut down. What that means for a patient is the very thing your body is trying to do can also cause harm and can actually lead to death. And pretty significant number of people die annually, about 350,000, and 1.7 million across the country are affected every year. It is the single most preventable cause of death in U.S. hospitals and hence the purpose and why it's so important for us to focus on. So in 2022, TGH launched an early warning system to detect the subtle signs of sepsis. Because the other thing about sepsis is, when we know it, we know how to treat it. What's difficult is identifying sepsis. There's many parameters we look at. Most times in the hospital, physicians, nurses are looking at pieces of data statically and assimilating it throughout the day. What we're seeing with our, when you see that, is we're often missing the early signs of sepsis. And with sepsis, early intervention is what saves lives. That's what makes the difference. The other thing that's important with sepsis, we know how to treat it, but you have to do it right. And that means, for simplicity's sake, let's say there's 10 things you have to provide to a patient to treat their sepsis, you have to do it in the correct order. So you can't do three, seven, and 10 before you do one. Those things will lead to poorer outcomes, which leads to organ dysfunction and leads to death and failure. So what we did was put together a sepsis team, led by what's called rapid response team. And rapid response team is a group of critical care nurses that are constantly monitoring our patients across our thousand bed hospital, looking for early signs of sepsis. And they've made a tremendous impact in the lives of our patients and by conservatively, we estimate that we save about 300 lives a year, people going home to their families who otherwise were not. But we had a problem. So our original partner, who set up our sepsis program with us, was no longer going to be able to support it. And we had learned how important this was for our team members, for our physicians, and for our patients, this tool that allowed them to make a better diagnosis and treat the patient more quickly, was quickly going away. So we turned her up, and our partners and said, can you help us? And this is where speed to value comes in. We knew we couldn't go a day without this. We know how important it was for our patients. And so we sat with Palantir and identified the opportunity. The entire process from scoping the initial work to onboarding and deploying the production workflows was complete within six weeks with plenty of time to implement prior to our loss of our prior service. So what we call this is a forward-deployed approach to clinical workflows. And you see here one of our rapid response team nurses using the platform in real time. So the solution, the engineers work side by side with our rapid response team, nurses, not to just rebuild what we had, but to look at what we had, spend time with them, look at the workflows, and build improvements in what they were looking for and what they felt would make their lives better. The rapidity really comes from taking down the barriers of leaders, getting in the way of what we're trying to get done and letting our frontline teams work directly with the Palantir engineers to build the product for their use. And that's what allowed us to be so quick using Foundry and enabled that team to see in real time their suggestions being put into play and wasn't working the way they thought I would. They can completely and continuously iterate over time to really drive change and improvement. And here's Dr. Laura Havana, who's going to show you how this works day to day. Thank you Peggy. So good morning, everyone, barely. And I'm here to give you a demonstration about the product. Key information, as you heard, is that what's important is both identifying and then treating and doing that timely to save lives. So this is coming from the seat of the rapid response team nurse. This is the the sepsis hub that we utilize. And it is based on sepsis, what we call sepsis criteria, three key areas. The patient's vital signs and both the combination and ranges of those and their abnormalities, a suspected source of infection, and also evidence of organ dysfunction. You can see here that we are able to identify just what is triggering that criteria and when it happened and in addition, the trends, which is really key. Take patient Naomi Kim here, who is escalated to the top of the sepsis concern list. In addition to those three areas, in addition to the vitals that I showed you on the previous slide, also it's bringing in unstructured data. That's a game changer for us. Prior to this, we relied unstructured data. And then our team, a very highly skilled team, had to spend a lot of time hunting and pecking through the chart to look for information that supported the diagnosis given some of the key vital signs or other lab values. Behind this, before I go further, this is really all the work that's been done. This is our sepsis data pipeline. You can see the complexity of this and that is what's bringing all that information together to our nurses to be able to pull that picture and start making a decision about whether this patient truly has sepsis and needs to quickly get on to the pathway. Again, back to their workspace. With this, they are able to now start thinking about, well, is this real? What do we need to do? Bringing the providers, the doctors, the physician, the patients' physician and asking, do you agree that a sepsis alert should be placed? They placed that in the system, as you just saw. And with that, now that initiates a treatment pathway and our ability to start monitoring that and get this essential treatment timely to the patient. Let's go fast forward an hour and an hour later. Now we see the treatment pathway detailed in a nice timeline. This was actually a really special request from our team because previously they relied on alarms and alerts that told them time was expiring for a specific treatment or they had missed the ideal timeline and they had to catch up. Now they can anticipate and see what's coming. In addition, you can zero in on the red line, which is the IV fluids, one of the key elements of the treatment. They can also make modifications. In this case with this patient, the physician felt we needed to be sure we had certain criteria related to the blood pressure and monitor that more closely to really customize the care for the patient. We're able to identify that physician's request and also document it in the record to make it understood. What's key about this is that not only are we treating the patient, we're also able to take all this information and all this feedback, tie the alerts and the actions to what's happening and keep feeding the system that learns it. So in the end, not only are we treating the patient, we're also improving on our sepsis and ensuring that we develop more accuracy, less false alarms, making this workflow even more ideal. Again, just like in Identity, the pipeline you saw for identifying the sepsis in the patient, there is a very complex pipeline of data also for the treatment algorithm. So now we can go back to the patient and see that the criteria have been met, the nurse was able to go to the bedside, initiate the IV fluids in the way that the physician had authorized, make that change and note that. Again, this is overcoming really the current, the previous limitations we had of the electronic health record and our care processes, care delivery processes. And it helps us better understand the work being done when it needs to be done. Please recognize that, again, our previous algorithms did not give us this much insight into the work that we were doing. So for this common condition of sepsis and being the leading cause of death for patients in the hospital, preventable cause of death, we're improving the ability to make what's often a very difficult diagnosis, make it more readily, and then implement a series of treatments and additional testing more effectively. So all the while that we're doing that, the end user's actions and the patient's journey are being measured against the course of all the patients. So what you really have is an improvement multiplier. With every patient we treat, we improve the care of the next patient. That's really the power of this. And we've seen great results from it. Our mortality from sepsis is half of what's quoted nationally across all health systems. We're getting patients home faster to their families and back to their lives. We've reduced the length of stay, the time they spend in the hospital by 15% for patients with sepsis. And we're confident now that we're continually learning. We're going to make those results, those results are going to get only better. So we're now taking this approach to other clinical conditions and helping our team really be successful in the care that they're giving. And that's really their commitment to their work and to the patients in our community that they serve. Thank you. I'm really honored and so appreciative of the partnership we have with Palantir and the great things to come.
