Nach всегда derppenочно tuttra The relevant estan with technical shapes such as Zooscovit 19 approved gay Through the integration of public-to-bank data from a scale of data, as demographic and economic information, we have given it to tourism and market and COVID-19 data from the RIVM, we have built a broad image of the safety region. This image gives an overview of the crisis situation, in this case the pandemic. Every authorized team like the safety region director and information managers, can take the COVID-19 measures and a geografic distribution, which will soon be very soon. Let's say that I have been working for Zuit Limburg with the increasing number of people we can be able to visit in the coming weeks. The warnings on the right side are not to be read out, so that the affected people can quickly and efficiently visit. Let's look at the rules. We see that this area has a higher than average population than the average population, and how less positive people are tested, than the national average, are more visible at home and overlaid people. After the COVID-19-specific information, I can dig deeper into other information about the areas, such as demographics, socio-economic and mobility data. The integrated public mobility data from Google lets us see how the mobility of the residents reacts to the measures of the pandemic. When I look at my radar, I want the people in the area to visit, who have been in the coming two weeks. Here I see the information for Limburg Zuit in the coming two weeks. Before I start the analysis, I would like to present the latest information to the collective data. My colleague and I can now keep the region in future analyses. Let's now look at the situation in the region. The water-saving data lets me know where extra attention is. These water-saving combine data about regional monuments, with the expected value of the economy, information about the weather and data about COVID. The triggers for these water-saving are the team itself dynamics in. There is a football competition between Zoroah and YC in Helmontsport on 14th December. I can look at the context of the environment. As the current situation of the environment is changing and the weather is changing. Also, there are supporters in the stadium that are standing behind us. They want to come together in the middle of the city, where the pressure and risk can be formed for the support of the other half-meter distance. To set up this population, I can now tell you that they are receiving a mail-in. As the last step, I can combine these areas in a report to see the ROT or RBT over the years. Or to share with a colleague. This report is live and lets the most up-to-date view of the situation. Thanks to the most significant data-finishment, this report can be parameterised so that we can share between the regions and the cooperation. The southern six regions in the field lab have used these tools to support the pandemic. Together we will continue to work on this and evaluate our safety and crisis tools for the safety regions.
