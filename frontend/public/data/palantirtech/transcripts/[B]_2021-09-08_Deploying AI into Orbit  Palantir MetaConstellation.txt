TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Palantir's Metaconstellation software harnesses the power of growing satellite constellations, deploying AI into space to provide insights to decision-makers here on Earth. Our Metaconstellation integrates with existing satellites, optimizing hundreds of orbital sensors and AI models, and allowing users to ask time-sensitive questions across the entire planet. Important questions, like where are their indicators of wildfires or how are climate changes affecting crop productivity and when and where are naval fleets conducting operations. Metaconstellation pushes Palantir's edge AI technology to a new frontier. As we all know, submarines present threats to the US and its allies, and to protect strategic interests, allied forces need to track every submarine's deployment around the world, and at the forefront of this challenge are anti- submarine warfare officers. They turn to Metaconstellation to monitor ports across the Pacific. Let me show you a little bit about what that looks like. In response to allied monitoring requests, Metaconstellation dynamically determines which orbiting sensors are available. Integrated through Palantir, the constellations then collaboratively schedule coverage over each port. Meanwhile, Apollo for edge AI assigns tailored AI micro-models to each satellite. Running onboard the satellite, the models will automatically find submarines and stream those insights directly to users. With the mission planned, Apollo automatically reconfigures each of the satellites pushing the right micro-models into orbit. And as a software payload on board, Palantir's edge AI platform connects complex satellite subsystems to models integrating new AI with the hardware. The best part, my favorite part is that as it orbits, the edge AI platform huts once, the right micro-models in. Rapidly reconfiguring the satellite. The models process imagery, they detect submarines, geo-locate them, and then determine any movement since the last collection pass, all in under a second. When the AI sees a submarine movement, that insight is directly downlinked to allied forces as the satellite passes overhead, and the anti-submarine warfare officers are notified in just minutes, empowering them to respond in a way that we've never seen before. As you can tell, we're really excited about Palantir's Metaconstellation and see it as the software that brings hundreds of satellites to bear on your hardest problems. Whether it's the anti-submarine warfare officer that I just described using it to find submarines or first responders, leveraging AI to spot wildfire signs. Metaconstellation is there to empower users.
