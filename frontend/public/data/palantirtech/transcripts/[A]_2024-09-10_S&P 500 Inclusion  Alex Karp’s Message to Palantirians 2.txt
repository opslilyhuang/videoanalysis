TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

On Friday, Palantir was admitted to the S&P, which is an enormous, momentous occasion for every palantirian. It is enormous because the way in which we built the company should have precluded membership to the most elite institution and economic life, the S&P 500. In order to be on the S&P 500, you have to be gap-profitable, which is a financial way of saying you have to make real tendies, subtracting everything after subtracting every form of room enumeration that could possibly be included, including your well-deserved equity. And we did it. And how did we do it? We built the best products in the world. We started off in one area of the West, Clandestine Services. We migrated into the military, into spec ops, into US commercial and into US, into commercial globally. And how did we do that? We built products, first PD, PG, then we built Apollo, then we built products for the spec ops, then we built Maven, then we built Foundry, then we built the ontology, and we then integrated that into AIP. All of these products were conceived and productized, and now are being platformized, meaning we are taking them and making them the base substrate of what enterprises do, i.e. using us instead of what sometimes could be described as a monster internally that prevents the use of the most important technologies of our lifetime, i.e. AI and large language models, as an end user. And these were conceived again and productized, in some cases a decade before anyone else even thought that you would need them, much less that the whole enterprise would turn on a platform that actually could power AI and large language models. It's still radical to the point where people do not completely comprehend, they do not comprehend how we could have turned a switch and gone to gap profitability and gone from what adults, professional managers and some analysts thought was a fragrance-dine monster powered by a freak show leader me to a dynamic, clearly profitable company worthy of and admitted to the SMP 500. And we did it our way. While everyone is now running around talking about how they should build platforms, how you should try to get power-interians, realizing that no credible institution in commercial life can really be built without power-interior or an ex-power-interiorian, we had already begun this. At the DPO we rejected professional management, people everywhere discussing how to build companies in a way that keeps the somewhat, if not, toxic, often carcinogenic, influence of people who have written power points out of your company. Pallantier did this naturally. Our products reflect that, our culture reflects it, our revenue reflects it, our quality of revenue affects it, reflects it. And by the way, our investor class, people trend to use the term retail investor, which is another way of saying people courageous enough to invest their own money, otherwise known as tending's, in what they believe in. And look at the list of the people our partners, I hate the term clients, but look at the list of people that use our product, the most important client-essend services, the most important special operators, the most important AI targeting work in the world, the most important allies, none of whom were ashamed to support in private or in public, they rely on Pallantier. Look at our list of commercial partners in and outside the U.S., but especially in the U.S., that use Pallantier either foundry, the ontology, AIP, all the above, and are beginning, and in some cases are already using our platform as a platform. And then look at our structural advantage of having this, a company built around what you ought to build, not what you were told to build, in some weird, otherwise called artistic program that's kind of academic and imposed upon you by people that have no skin on the game. And the list of that we are going to continue to resist, that it's not just for our sake, but for the sake of our partners that rely on us. In any case, everybody, all of you who are inside the company and around the world should celebrate that the Rebels won. The Rebels won on Friday. I don't know any other occasion like this where the Rebels actually got inside the gate and helped the institutions transform themselves, and there's no better metaphor for that than being admitted to the S&P 500. And while it's maybe not the most important thing, I am really, really, really happy. Because we did this, we did this together, and the future belongs to us. So let's go have, let's go attack, have some fun, and celebrate a momentous occasion. Thank you.
