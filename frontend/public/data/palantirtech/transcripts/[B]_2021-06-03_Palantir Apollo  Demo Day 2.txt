TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

At Palantir, we're committed to supporting the world's most important institutions and helping them solve their most important problems with our software platforms. These problems exist in the real world, so not only do problem spaces come in all shapes and sizes, but so do our customers operating environments. Our customers today use foundering Gotham from a diverse set of environments, corporate campuses, industrial worksites, laboratories, factories, and home offices. But our software must also run in remote on-premises data centers, active combat zones, and classified networks. From submarines to airplanes, even to drones. So while the vast majority of our customers are able to take advantage of our public cloud sass, these real world constraints mean that many of our customers are unable to do so. Apollo is the silent third platform that sits behind both Foundry and Gotham. It is what allows us to meet our customers where they are, to power their missions, and solve their most important problems, no matter where on the world these are. Apollo manages the end-to-end set of software platform considerations, from our developers' keyboards all the way to our customers at the front line. At the core of Apollo is an end-to-end, highly extensible framework for continuous delivery in all environments. It provides an autonomous control plane for the continuous delivery of standard new product features, security updates, and platform configurations. But Apollo was also designed to meet the complex realities of our customers. It understands the granular state of Foundry and Gotham worldwide, and it is responsible for ensuring that the whole fleet is healthy and up to date, and it does so while working within the confines of each customer's unique requirements. It takes a sophisticated approach to rolling out new releases, including blue-green upgrades with composite success criteria, and a fully autonomous approach to rollbacks in cases where health criteria aren't met. The platform's observability framework works hand in hand with continuous delivery, leveraging both synchronous and asynchronous telemetry to monitor the complete life cycle of every single piece of software. As you'll hear about shortly, Apollo's reach extends far beyond traditional SaaS architecture. From the autonomous management of edge devices, including those within heterogeneous and shifting network topologies, to capabilities further up the stack, including the complete lifecycle management of machine learning models. Today, Apollo has been key to increasing velocity of both new and existing SaaS business. This year we saw more customer onboarding than ever before, with many fueled by real urgency around COVID-19 and other critical problems facing both public and private institutions alike. Apollo enables us to onboard these new customers to our SaaS in a matter of hours. But not only can we service new customers more easily, but with Apollo, our developers can roll out features to the entire existing fleet automatically. Apollo is the beating heart of our platforms, working around the clock to continuously deliver software to our customers. It's not only automated but intelligent, enabling our developers to not only push changes but to push them with confidence, shipping new features faster without compromising on stability. Through the use of release channels, soak times, blue-green deploys, and maintenance windows, we ensure that our highly available system stays highly available. While we've been in the cloud since 2013, it's only in the past couple of years that we've seen massive adoption of our SaaS platform. We're large conservative institutions once viewed SaaS and the cloud more generally, with a healthy amount of skepticism, we've since seen a shift in viewpoint. By successfully demonstrating its value to our customers, these organizations have come to embrace our SaaS platform. In 2020, nearly all of our customers opted for our cloud-based SaaS. This includes industries that are very highly regulated, from financial institutions to utility companies to governments across the globe. SaaS also powers our COVID-19 response work, supporting over 100 private companies and 10 governments, including the US and the UK. Our SaaS is also used heavily by the military, both in the US and abroad. With Apollo, our SaaS is able to meet our customers' most stringent requirements. Our natively multi-homed architecture provides fault-tolerant, resilient platforms that are replicated across distinct physical sites. And our global footprint ensures that we meet our customers' evolving data residency requirements. We offer a wide array of connectivity options for customers with private connections, custom access points, and other non-standard networks. And it's backed by our auto-scaling infrastructure that adapts to spiky workloads, handling large data volume seamlessly, eliminating that tedious and often-era prone burden of capacity planning. Taken together, all of these options have allowed us to bring some of our most conservative customers to use SaaS in the cloud for the very first time. Apollo's flexibility enables our SaaS platform to support the requirements of the world's most risk-averse and most mission-critical systems today. You can see some examples here listed of these systems. Suffice it to say, they need the latest technology, and they also need it without risk of downtime. Apollo is able to deliver. Our SaaS is authorized to be used for mission-critical national security systems by the US Department of Defense. This authorization is the most stringent for unclassified data, and you can count the number of other SaaS systems who have this accreditation on one hand. We are committed to continuing to support the world's most important institutions by ensuring that SaaS-like efficiency, coupled with reliable stability and top-notch security, are our top priorities. We built Apollo to be infrastructure agnostic, liberating our customers from cloud vendor lock-in. Apollo powers critical workloads and spans multiple cloud providers today. And with Apollo, we are taking our SaaS beyond the usual hyperscale providers like AWS and Azure, and we will thrive in a world of future cloud vendor vulcanization. For example, we are day one members of the GaiaX Initiative, the recently announced project to build a common data infrastructure for Europe. And we also know that the landscape changes rapidly, so we're taking this a step further. The large organizations we work with aren't homogenous internally. They know the future is multi-cloud, so we are actively investing in the ability of our customers to dynamically shift workloads between infrastructure providers on demand. And we're working towards a complete BYO ecosystem that will empower our customers to bring their own storage and compute wherever it may live natively to our platforms. Apollo enables not just multi-cloud, but multi-classification SaaS as well. Learning software on classified networks today has its own set of unique challenges. Lack of outside connectivity, additional security and compliance constraints, and the need to transfer data between networks physically using DVDs to name a few. Apollo's flexibility means that it works across all classification levels. Apollo is running today in unclassified, secret, and top secret environments, powering the same SaaS platforms that you see in the public cloud. Apollo enables us to improve the speed and delivery of software binaries, bringing the latest features to classified environments nearly as fast as they make it to the public cloud. It also powers crucial cross-domain workflows, automatically synchronizing critical data assets across these very same networks. We are defining what it means to be a SaaS in the classified space. We're moving from a world of slow and minimal upgrades with static software that quickly gets out of date to a world where the benefits of SaaS can be realized in the classified world as well. We will solidify this position by becoming the first SaaS authorized for the US Department of Defense Impact Level 6, enabling us to scale even more quickly across secret networks. Apollo also takes our platforms to places where no SaaS has gone before, to challenging physical conditions, war zones, remote deserts across oceans, to places with delayed, disconnected intermittent or low bandwidth environments. Places where network cables do not exist, to mobile and ruggedize places, humvees, subs, downrange data centers. These are all places where customers historically have only had access to legacy, static, custom built systems. But we've changed the game by bringing the same powerful software available in industry to these challenging environments, providing them with our platforms. That are always cutting edge and always up to date. In with Apollo, we've done this while maintaining SaaS-like margins. For our customers, Apollo unlocks unprecedented scalability because it works for even the most complex network topology. Combined with technologies like Nexus Peering, Apollo powers a global mesh network for the US Department of Defense, running fixed, tactical, and mobile forward-deployed nodes of all shapes and sizes. And with Apollo, we can do this with an extremely small headcount. Projects that would have previously been infeasible due to complex custom work. Projects that took so long to build that they were nearly obsolete by the time they were completed are now within reach, all because of Apollo. Apollo is also revolutionizing how we think about the dynamic capabilities of these nodes and the edge. When most people talk about the edge today, they only talk about the edge as a static set of environments, with fixed sites, fixed topologies, limited form factors, and limited specialized compute capabilities. Apollo turns the edge operational by enabling us to adapt to the inevitable changes in the physical environment. It handles changes in connectivity, changes in scale, loss of nodes, or repartitioning of networks. It adapts seamlessly, allowing us to bring SaaS to the edge across a variety of form factors from autonomous vehicles to ruggedize mobile data centers. But Apollo is more than just infrastructure management. As we've mentioned, it's about management of all parts of the platform, from our developers' keyboards, all the way to our customers on the front line. Apollo powers software-defined data integrations, delivering and always updated out of the box suite of tools for interacting with data sources of all types. And within our platforms, Apollo also powers an expanding set of workflows, from model management, simplifying the release and testing of AI or machine learning models, to anomaly detection, updating algorithms and workflows for high-scale sensor data. And it powers these workflows for an expanding set of developers, supporting applications on our platforms built by customers and also third-party partners. Apollo has revolutionized Palantir's operations. And while we initially built this for ourselves to power our own platforms, our customers have recently started to ask if they can use Apollo for theirs. This is something that we've started to explore. Apollo has allowed us to dramatically expand our market footprint. Our existing SaaS has become more efficient, and Apollo has enabled us to go after new markets and customers, who historically haven't ever been able to use a SaaS product. We're able to meet our customers where they are, and continue to deliver software at a higher bar than has ever before been possible. We're looking forward to pushing these capabilities even further, improving Apollo to further service hard to reach environments and workflows, and truly taking Apollo to the next level. Apollo means we can solve the world's hardest problems, and do it in a way that is scalable and sustainable, on a timeline and budget that no one else can.
