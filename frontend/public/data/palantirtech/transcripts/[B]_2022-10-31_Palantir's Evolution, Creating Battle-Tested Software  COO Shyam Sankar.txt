TRANSCRIPT

All right. What's great to be back in the shire and welcome you all here. I wanted to frame out some of the ways that we're thinking about our product and thinking about the product and the context of the world that we do live in, what you heard really from Alex and from Mike there. Can we go back one, sorry? Yeah, so it's clear as we just discussed that the geopolitical consensus that we've had over the last 40 years, that the world would get more stable, more predictable, more peaceful, that's crumbled. And I think something that's less clear but equally true is that the software consensus that underpinned that view has also crumbled. In a world that's getting more predictable, the most important thing that you can focus on is the perfect plan. The perfect prediction of what's going to happen. But when the plans went awry, when all of this stuff crumbled in a world that we're actually living in, one where things are becoming less certain, more unpredictable, less clear, the one thing you actually know is that your plan is wrong and that all of your alpha as an institution is going to come down to your ability to react to the error in your plan, to react to reality. And that I think is where we, you know, all the pundits said that software was going to eat the world from my perspective between Ukraine, inflation, COVID and the aftershocks that have followed, it looks much more like the world ate software. You know, how much software that predated those events really withstood the test of time and really helped companies navigate those challenges from my experience on the front lines, almost none. And I think the government has always really understood this, that it's not about your plan. What I'm saying is that plans are worthless. Planning is invaluable, but plans are worthless. And of course, the saying is that no plan survives first contact. And that's really the formative experiences that we had as working with customers that viewed that real capability, like how you were going to win, not just people who are productive, but how are you going to win as your ability to react to reality faster than the other party could. And now that's what we're seeing. Like, in a time of stability, it was all beta. The rising tide lifted all boats, you know, yeah, focus on efficiency. And in the reality that we live in, you know, alpha is back in a big way. And that is going to be your competitive advantage as an institution going forward. So when we look at Ukraine and COVID inflation, what we see is that literally every function of every business is breaking under these stresses. And what's interesting about the phenomenon and Ari's question actually hit it, it's not the, you know, the aftershocks are more profound and dislocative than the initial earthquake itself. And those things are continuing to ricochet around. And it seems very unlikely that we're going to get into some sort of, you know, emergent stable equilibrium like this. It's actually going to be a place that we have to continue responding and reacting. And that is exactly the world that we built our software for. To be the agility layer that would help your enterprise respond to everything that's changing here. So whether that's optimizing patient bed utilization and nurse staffing levels at a hospital whose fundamental labor model and backlog has been dislocated massively from COVID and everything after that, or its driving supply chain visibility into what's clear to build. We have started 25 major supply chain projects this year alone, where that's managing logistics in the face of now increasing fuel prices. But before that, it was truck shortages, worker shortages, and increasingly tight fulfillment windows where you can actually go and capture the revenue. We're keeping automotive factories open when you realize that every single wiring harness that you put in, you know, five dollar a part that you put into your car comes from Ukraine. Like how do you dynamically reprioritize your customer orders and their production plan that you're going to have in a way that keeps everything fully employed here? And that's how we think about, you know, that is the world that for a better part of 15 years we built our software for. So when we think about our software platforms, we really think about them as operating systems, not systems of insight, but really the way that your business runs, you know, operating systems that aspire to act as the nervous system, as the cardiovascular system of your enterprise, Gotham, Foundry Apollo, it creates a single pane of glass to help you execute your mission in Gotham's context or run your business with Foundry or deliver your software in Apollo sense. And Gotham is very much focused in the defense context on AI enabling the kill chain for deterrence. Really a lot of the themes that Alex had spoken about here, but for us that means operating across all domains from space to mud and integrating every sensor with every shooter and getting faster and faster at helping humans make decisions and outcompete the adversary here. And the Foundry context, now going from kill chains to supply chains, it's really about connecting and integrating the decision making within your value chain, not just within your four walls, but really the entirety of your value chain. From your suppliers to your customers, that's the equivalent of from your sensors to your shooters there. And in doing so, it's focused on making you more different, not more similar. This is not productivity software like Zoom that's just about improving how efficient you can do something, it's about being the ultimate expression of your strategy as a business, which is going to be different than your competitors, going to be different than adjacent industries, that is the nature of alpha, that you have to be more different and differentiated than anyone else. And these platforms, they focus on time to value, like that's where we see real transformation happen here. And of course it took us 15 years and $3 billion to build this software, but what it's really allowed us to do is to build the software the world needs before it knows it needs it, because we've had this monastic commitment to focusing on delivering end-to-end outcomes. We were able to power the Afghan evacuation with 22 hours notice. We were able to build the U.S. and UK COVID vaccine supply chains with five weeks notice. Of course it's more like 15 years plus five weeks or 15 years plus 22 hours. But that monastic focus is what helps you understand what is left to build. And that as a result is powering this flywheel for us. We're just building so much new product. Product that we hope will meet the moments for the world that we see coming in the near term here. And see throughout the conference here software like Metaconstellation, which has a digital twin of commercial space collection capabilities and allows you to reimagine how you actually drive tasking. And certainly that has an effect on the battlefield. But it's also helping utility scale solar companies image very remote solar installations and better understand how to do predictive maintenance and how to optimize their solar production. So software like SkyKit that takes Metaconstellation puts an important form factor for soldiers in the field to actually use to drive operational tasking. Or pipeline builder which is transformed the economics of data integration. At the NHS in the UK it is tripled the speed by which they're able to bring data from 400 different hospitals together for clinical outcomes. Foundry unchained now means that you can run Foundry on top of your extant cloud data warehouses. And a Fed start which builds on our Apollo offering is going to enable software companies in the US to actually get Fed ramped in aisle six certification literally overnight. So just more and more stuff here that we think is going to be key to the events that are about to come. But this is FoundryCon. So let's focus a little bit on Foundry for a second here. And I think about Foundry and the world that we're likely to see the challenges that our customers face. There are I think really three critical capabilities that every institution is going to need to navigate this. And the first of these is that Foundry makes the marginal cost of data integration effectively zero. The cynical way to think about Palantir is that it took something as sexy as James Bond to motivate engineers to work on a promise boring as data integration. But we have productized this. Instead of having lots of humans going out and trying to bring data together, we have software defined data integration. And for things that cannot be completely productized, you have pipeline builder that just helps you do it ten times faster than your alternative. And this means data integration goes from being a liability to an asset. We were able to integrate with each of the 6,000 hospitals in the US in the first three weeks of the pandemic to create the first national level visibility into ICU bed utilization, PPE consumption rates and ventilator capacity. Each of these hospitals has a system that's kind of unique and bespoke and messed up in its own way. That's the nature of these things. And you can't really go at that speed or scale unless you have software that's writing its own data pipelines for you. We're able to bring 26 different ERP systems together in less than two weeks. You know, not two decades, not two years, and less than two weeks. And this is the single pane of data. I think that's a really crucial capability and concept for every institution. But data integration is not inherently valuable. It's a means to an end. It gets you to the starting line. What are you supposed to do now with this integrated data? And the second major pillar is that people will need to radically transform their own marginal cost of application development. How long is it going to take you to build new applications that actually operate your business? I don't mean dashboards that just give you insights. I mean, actual applications that are interconnected to each other that integrate with your underlying transact- you're existing extant transactional investments so that you can allocate inventory so that you can change your production plan so that you can task a drone. That's absolutely crucial. In the first two days of having that integrated data foundation, the US government was able to build their national level PPE allocator. You can think about having ICU bed utilization and ventilator capacity inventory levels. That's the demand side of the forecast. Where might things need to go? Now how do I connect that up into my supply chain? And just having, you know, it's not two months. It's not many months. It's two days to build an application that frontline users and all 50 states and tribes and jurisdictions can use to drive this decision-making on the frontline. And the third capability that integrates that operational reality with strategy is the digital twin. To me, this is one of the most needed modeling and simulation capability that allows you to react to reality. You know, if your plan was perfect, you wouldn't really need this. But when things happen in the world, when your supplier gives you half of what they said they were going to give you, when the disease spreads in ways that you hadn't anticipated, you need to be able to ask the question, what can I do now? And what can I do now is enough itself a function of your own goal, your own strategy and institution. Are you trying to optimize revenue, optimize production, optimize customer fulfillment and satisfaction? The answer to that question will depend on the day. It will depend on your goal. So it will depend on what's going on here. How do you get the system to generate courses of action for you to use the government terminology on this that enables the operator to quickly execute something and then understand the full consequences of what might happen. Not only within their own function, you know, it's great if you can buy something 30% off if your job is procurement, but if that has a 40% less yield and production, you're just passing the buck on. So how do you model this? This is the integrated value chain here. How do you model this holistically, understand what's actually in the best interest of the business? And so this is really the core of what we've invested in, continue investing in, I think you'll see some of these themes from the speakers today. And that's really the most important part here, which is while I am really excited to have you all here and hear your feedback and what's working, what's not working, and my own little lens, imagine the future of what will continue to build. I think the most exciting part for you all is to hear from each other and hear about the challenges and experiences and what could be. So thank you once again for joining us.
