TRANSCRIPT

Good morning, everyone. I'm Jody Cohen from Mount Sinai Health System in New York, where an eight hospital health system across three boroughs of New York City without patient locations, over 200 across the five boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, Westchester, and Long Island. Our biggest challenge over the course of handling and managing these billions of patient records and patients on a yearly basis is space. We needed a way to optimize our space in order to get patients through the system in the most high quality and patient-friendly way. In 2017, we embarked on the creation of a clinical command center, which helped us to centralize our, all of our beds in one place, and be able to oversee where we might have capacity for our patients at one hospital versus another. At the same time, we embarked on a hospital at home initiative, which is one of the newer beds without walls, components of healthcare that you might have read about. This allows patients to recover at home as though they're in an acute care setting. It reduces infection and allows patients to be with their family and to maintain comfort. The difficulty with getting this program off the ground is evaluating the patient criteria to see which patients should be eligible. Inwork the volunteer to help us build a system that could evaluate patient records real time looking at blood results, initial diagnoses, radiology tests, et cetera, to determine which patients might be eligible for this kind of care. It allowed clinicians in the emergency room to have decision-making capabilities enhanced by this data, forming lists and allowing patients to go to the right place at the right time. Our second biggest problem on the financial front has to do with our clinical denials. I don't know if I have an insurance company in the audience, but don't take anything I say personally. We have addressed on our financial strategy around clinical denials with help from Palantium. And when my boss first introduced the concept to me, I almost jumped up and down to have such help with this issue. You can see this graphic shows the growing rate of our clinical denials over time. This impacts cash flow and makes our AR grow quite significantly. Using the clinical ontology that was built for the hospital at home and the clinical command center, we were able to leverage financial data and incorporate legal guidelines, our managed care contracts, and other clinical documentation components into the digital twin, allowing us to act a little bit faster with relation to our denials. Our first step was to generate denial letters based on the documentation that the managed care company was questioning. It was a manual process that required eight denial writers and millions of dollars in outsourced resources to evaluate the clinical denial, review the medical record, write a denial letter, and then mail the records to the payer. In this circumstance, it would take 45 minutes to one hour per denial. With the large language model reading the chart and consolidating the information, it takes about eight minutes now for the letter to be created and reviewed. And all that needs to be done is download the letter to the payer. We've seen 100% FTE efficiency over this. We've been able to manage all the letters, whereas before some we get lost in the shuffle, creating more denials for timely filing. And based on the overturn rate of those denials, because that's where really the rubber meets the road, we have seen a 3% increase in our overturn rate that we expect to result in over $13 million in revenue that we're entitled to. So this is a demo of the process. We have a patient, Diana Cronin, with COPD. The managed care payer said she wasn't clinically eligible for an inpatient stay. And based on our doctor's decision making and the care she received, we are already deemed toreligible for that stay. We read through the clinical documentation guidelines that have been preloaded into foundry. We match those up with the documentation in the patient's chart. And then we generate a letter that includes both components in our response to the payer. They simply, the template is created, the letter is written at some point. And then based on all the clinical documentation, the legal, if any requirements, for instance, if a patient stays longer than two days in the hospital, Medicare requires that they're covered for clinical necessity. These data points are impossible to match up for a human. It would take a day to look through all this information and make sure it's correct. So not only is the letter enhanced through this process, it has a lot more backup behind the scenes. It's okay. We print the letter and it goes. We're trying to work together more extensively with Palantir. I feel the uses are endless. The best thing about it is that all the information is in one place in a giant data lake where I'm able to evaluate not only whether or not the criteria was met, but whether or not I should get paid. And if I will get paid, I can probably predict if this payer will pay me based on this denial letter, this denial letter, reviewer, which hospital they were in, which payer they have. I'm looking forward to being able to use this on the front end as well. We've already started and expanded our scope so that on the front end, the social workers and utilization reviewers in the emergency room can have the data consolidated for them using the same tool that was built for the hospital at home to see if they can justify the admission in advance to the payer so that there won't be a denial at the end of the day. I want to thank you for listening and if you have any questions, I'll be around.
