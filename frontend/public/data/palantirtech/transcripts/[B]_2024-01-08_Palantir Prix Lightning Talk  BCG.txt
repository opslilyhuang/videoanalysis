Hi, everyone. It's consultant. I don't think we are typically expected to fit much into three Minutes, but we're going to do our best. So you probably aren't familiar with bzg apart from the Strategy side, but we also build advanced applications for our Clients. And we've been working with pouns here on a number of different Initiatives where we're both partnering up to build those Applications, which Rajesh here is going to talk about. As well as working to build products on top of the Foundry suite and the AIP suite so that we can accelerate our Engagements with clients. I'm going to talk about one of those. Now, you might wonder why we would go about partnering with Pouns here to do that. And the thing is, whenever we're building products internal At pcg that we need to roll out the clients, we need to be Thinking about how we're going to build foundational capabilities, How we're going to manage those over time, and then how we're Actually going to deploy that to clients and customize it for Them without having to rebuild everything. And that's the secret sauce of what we can actually do with Pound tier. So whenever a ip came out, one of the first use cases i started Building with some of my pound tier friends over here that we Work with was a asset management use case focused on managing Kind of the end-to-end sales cycle for sales reps both internal And external at asset managers. And it's a perfect case for being able to plug gen ai capabilities Alongside ai capabilities plus data. So you could start with like a salesperson comes in start their Day there are a ton of different insights and signals that have been Raised such as like you should go engage with this person because There's a fund that's relevant for them. You can then personalize all the interaction with them based on the Customer profile using then gen ai models to tailor the email Outreach so that you're saving tons of time for the salesperson And i just come in and tailor it a little bit and hit go. And then we also worked on preparing some tools so that you could Prepare easily for meetings with those customers after they respond back. And then maybe most importantly because data is important we Are able to take things like meeting notes and instantly extract the Information from those meeting notes and insert them back into a CRM saving A huge amount of time for the salesperson that typically they Skip over and then you don't have tracking of those processes. And something that that then we can take and deploy at our clients and Really accelerate our delivery within. Thank you, Barric. We've been working with a lot of financial and retail clients who have a Ton of unstructured data documents and a ton of material that can be Used for various use cases. We have been working with them to understand the right use cases that They can leverage for gen ai journey and also pick the right platforms To accelerate the gen ai journey. When we looked at Palantir, Palantir provided the perfect ecosystem To enable the end to end journey of gen ai right from the time to extract The documents from different data sources to all the way to like You know running their your vectorization, your chunking and a full end To end set of capabilities to interact with different types of LLMs and provide a simple interface for the users to log in, Play with the system, provide them a simple no-code, Local UI to actually test the gen ai outputs and understand what is Good and provide real time feedback.
