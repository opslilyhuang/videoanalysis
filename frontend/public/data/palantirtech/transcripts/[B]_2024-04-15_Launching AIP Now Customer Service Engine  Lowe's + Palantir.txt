TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Okay, great. Good afternoon, everyone. It's quite exciting to see. I think we have hundreds of participants joining from across the globe. So to perhaps kick us off, my name is Anarag Ball. I had the AIP platform implementation teams that volunteer. Today we're launching the first of our AIP now applications, which are intended to provide AI-ready applications with a few clicks to both existing customers as well as our hopefully new partners in the future. Today we're launching the AIP customer service engine. And I'm joined by my colleagues Unibrood and Yusuf from Palantir as well as our partner from Lowe's in the Shant. And I'll hand it over to Anirud to perhaps kick us off. Awesome. Thanks Anarag. My name is Anirud and I lead some of our work in retail and consumer globally. I'm also one of the AIP leads here at Palantir. And I'm so excited to launch the AIP customer service engine today because customer service is a thing that we've all felt paid and we all viscerally relate to. So while people trickle in, I'd like to share a personal anecdote of mine as a customer of a brand that I love. So I'm a member of a fitness club here in London. They're a medium-sized business and they pride themselves in their customer service. And the customer service is actually amazing when you go into the club and the team members are friendly, the trainers are great. But when you have to get anything operational or administrative done, it is a bit of a pain. The only way to communicate with them is through email and every time you send an email, you get a canned response back. So a few months ago, I was traveling and I had to put my membership on freeze. So I sent them an email and I got a response immediately via email, which was where we're getting a large volume of customer queries and please wait 72 hours, we'll get back to you. I was like, okay, a few weeks ago, I forgot my umbrella there. I live in London. You need your umbrella here. So I wrote them another query. I was like, did you find this? And the same canned response again, we're receiving a large volume of customer queries. You know, please wait 72 hours. I didn't find that umbrella. And then it's happened a couple more times and you can say, you know, email my gym more than the average person. But that's beside the point. So a few days ago, I wrote a very thoughtful email to them, inviting them to this webinar. And you know, I want them to improve their customer service and we think we have a product to help them. And no points for guessing the response I got from them. We're getting a high volume of customer queries. Please wait 72 hours. So if there is anyone here from this club who has joined us today, awesome job. Can't wait to start building with you. If not, well, you're all at least 72 hours ahead of the curve. So let's get started. Loads has joined us today. There are AI leader in the retail industry and they're one of the biggest home improvement retailers out there. They're a Fortune 50 company and they're a first mover when it comes to customer service AI. And Chant is an engineering and AI leader at loads who's driving a lot of this work. And he's going to talk about kind of the story and the transformation that he's driving in with his team at loads. Then we're going to peel back the layers of the AIP customer service engine. This is the application that we're launching today. And use a penile. We go through a demo of the product and show you what it looks like. And then finally, you leave with the keys to your own instance of the customer service engine. So with that, over to Chant, take it away. Everyone, hope everyone's doing great. So Chant, as I introduced on Chant, I lead the AI and data products for a merchandising organization here at Loads. And today I'm going to walk you through the work which we have been doing with Palentir when it comes to one of our customer service centers. So let's move on to the next slide. So right of the bat, so before we get into what the business problem is and what the solution is, we just wanted to share what are the different things which we have observed so far. So we were kind of lagging in our ability to handle the call volume which was coming in. And because of that, our overdue activities were increasing because we started building a lag and it was becoming impossible to get around that. And at that point in time, we were working with Palentir on some other use case as well. And we were like, let's try a POC on this problem. So right of the bat, we identified a pilot region where we wanted to run this. And after completing the POC, we immediately saw a 75% reduction in our overdue activities, which is a huge number. And as it has a ripple effect, so you can do more with the same number of agents. So that was great. And on the right, you will see this chart which kind of shows how quickly we were able to move with Palentir as a tool. So that initial graph in January, that's our pilot. We kind of brought a few more people. And within four weeks, we were nationally launched. And in general, the kind of feedback which we have received from the people who are actually using the tool, they don't want to go back. So you will observe that again, post-February, there's a huge stickiness to the whole thing. They love the tool. And it has definitely improved how they kind of grow about their day. So other than that, it wasn't super transparent. And once we get to the demo, you will see all the data is available at an agent's fingertip. So that was the agent story. Now the people who manage these agents, they also never had this kind of visibility and transparency that how an agent is performing. Or let's say, somebody calls in sick at the last moment, but they still have 25 tasks assigned to them. So at that point in time, it has become like super convenient for managers to even go and manage the resources in a good way. So we can kind of attack the most important problems in a very prioritized way. So over to the next slide. And I'll kind of explain what kind of business unit for which, and hopefully in this slide, I'm trying to, I'll try to build like an intuition that why this is a hard problem. So stay with me. So I'm going to take an example here. Let's say that you are trying to do a kitchen remodel in your house. And you want to work with loads. So there are kind of three ways which you can go about it. One is DIY, which we call, I'll do it yourself. So let's say you're super handy and you know, like you just know how to kind of build a kitchen. Now very, very less number of people will build a kitchen. Maybe smaller things. We do see, we have like very active DIY community. But the other two options are that you go and hire a contractor, which is basically what we at Loes, we call them pros. So you go and hire a company which does kitchen remodel and then they can come at Loes and buy everything which you eventually want in your kitchen. And the third way to do it is, and that's what we're going to be talking about today, is our Loes installation services. So, and why like this is such a hard problem, right? And I just want everybody to kind of think through it. Like if you are doing a kitchen remodel end to end, right? You will have multiple specialized people coming into your home. So example is like at some point in time, a plumber will come in at some point in time, like a electrician will come in at some point time, a cabinet installer or a stone installer or you know, somebody needs to come in and put the flooring in. Somebody needs to come in and you know, like do do very, very different things. And before any of these installers come into your house, we also need to ensure that the product which they are coming to install has also been delivered to you. So, so that's the second complexity. Third complexity is for anytime these people are coming in or anytime these products are getting delivered, you need to be at home as well. So, so that's why we have set up this very specialized customer service system or agents to kind of you know, lead a customer through the entire journey as their kitchen is being re-built. And and it's very important for us to be super efficient while we are doing this because you are out of a kitchen while this project is going on and you know, like there's a limit to how much food you can reheat in a microwave. So, so so I think that's why like this was a really important problem for us. It has direct implications to our customer satisfaction and and you know, we are kind of like kind of like dispersing how you live in your own home while these projects are going on. And and that's why we we kind of started working with Palantir to see what we can do in this space. So, so moving on to the next slide. So, so this was like the problem in real life. Now, if you go to the next slide, I like like what's the equivalent. Yeah, so what's the equivalent implication on the technology side? So, so so this is an old business which we have been in for a super long time. So, of course, our systems have been aging. And and and as I said, like initially, right, like in general, the call volume which we have been receiving has like kind of gone out of control and and and and not having a super efficient system basically is leading to a poor customer performance and projects getting delayed and it affects basically everybody who is in this in this life cycle or system. So, so and and and the main problems with the with the technology stack which we had, you know, a customer agent was going through multiple screens, you know, like when you're calling a customer, you don't know what all has already been delivered to to their house, which all providers have already visited their house. So, so there was like it will take you like 17 20 clicks to kind of get to even a state where you know where the project stands. So, so at this point time, so, you know, like all of the things which I mentioned here, there was a lot of manual fungling which was going on. There was not a cool way to manage how the work will get assigned to agents. So, so so these were the problems which we put in front of the Palantir team and and we started looking into it. So, so so overall, like if I have to talk about the new solution which we have built in Palantir, it's ditches the data really, really well together. We we utilize the ontology which Palantir offers to kind of peace all the different information together. So, very quickly a customer agent can see that hey, this customer three three projects or three, you know, three work, work orders have already happened. Seven still need to happen. These items are delivered. So, in a in a very, very, you know, like intuitive screens, they can quickly see where this customer is in their project journey and and and then to manage we have a concept where we are smartly able to queue what is the next best task which an agent should be picking up and there's a list right in the morning, you know, when the agent is logging in, they know exactly how their day is going to go through. So, even if they have to self optimize a little bit, they can totally do that and and and if you remember the first graph which you saw, adoption has been great. We have seen a lot of stickiness from our agents. They're absolutely loving the solution. So, cool. So, if we move on to the next slide, this is this is like a true quote from one of our business partners Todd, you know, he's his director for our installation team operations and he and like this is a true quote, like all this was achieved in four months. You know, we came up with like we have trained the managers on how to train their teams and we onboarded like thousand users in just three weeks. So, this was mind blowing, almost magical like is you know, when I've talked to him. So, he was very, very impressed that how quickly we were able to move, you know, in this amazing platform. So, so so what what what are we planning now, right? That hey, cool. Looks like you guys are doing really great. We have unlocked new level of productivity, but of course we don't want to stop there. There's a whole another area where you know, how the expense requests are created by our providers, you know, sometimes the provider is not even showing up, but we end up paying them. How do we kind of get that money back? We are looking at the new AIP platform inside Palantir found itself to kind of see if we can take things to the next level and the demo, which we have planned for you today, we'll kind of touch on a few things. And and then in general, we have a couple of other use cases which are going on in Palantir already. So, we are trying to see one of them is our supply chain project. So, we want to see if we can bring like even more data. So, think in your head that if you are a customer and for some reason your cabinets are not getting delivered, now the agent will probably be able to go into the supply chain onology and kind of see that hey, this thing is stuck on a ship right now and kind of you know, we can escalate to kind of get that to you. So, those are the future looking things which are on the horizon here. Cool. So, I will request a use of now to come in, help me out with the demo. And hopefully we'll give you a quick idea on what is coming in future and how we are planning to leverage AIP. So, the screen that you see here, so I just want to make sure everybody knows this is this is very real but with fake data. So, because you know, we don't want to share real customer data. So, cool. So, on the left you are seeing the activity queue and that's what I was mentioning that agent is able to see that these are the different things which they have to go through today. So, at the top now, if we open the first one, so now with AIP we are going to the next step. What I mean by that is like the screens were showing that hey, these are the four or five work orders which have happened, these are the two future work orders which are going to be happening. And remember, these agents are closing their existing tasks, putting in some notes in there. So, now we are able to kind of get the power of gen AI. We are we are taking all the notes and all the interactions which have happened for a project so far. And we give a very, very clean guidance to the agent that send an email to xyz provider, confirm the installation date with them. And then once that confirmation will come, somebody from our team needs to call our customer Cedric Abbot in this case and kind of confirm that that install it like what will be the installation date when will they be at home. So, so, so, so it's like really, really powerful because to just come to this message, it might have taken an agent over even with the new intuitive screens just to kind of piece together the whole information. It might have still taken them 15 to 20 minutes because these are very, very complex projects in general. So, so yeah, this is really powerful. Then of course, once we started integrating gen AI, we started thinking where else we can do it. So, if if we click on email installer now, a beautiful email, a pre-written email kind of comes to you. You can with the customer name mentioned there with the work order mentioned there. So, so again, a very, very intuitive case to be tried in gen AI, but because we had all the other data states, we were able to quickly bring it to this experience. The second thing which I will like to so if you get out of this now and create follow up task, if we if we go on to that work order and and and basically view details step by step. So, yeah, so yeah, click on that perfect. So, so here you can see that we took one of the SOPs which we want our agents to be using and we kind of personalized it to this particular task and at the end, let's say agent also wants to see that hey, you know, what's the SOP documentation they can do that as well. But we use gen AI to read our SOP documentation. We used gen AI a second action to read where the task is right now and kind of muck fuse together to give a very personalized recommendation that how you need to be creating a follow up task. So, so that so that's how we are using gen AI to kind of think the timing and ensuring that our agents are following the SOPs as well. So, so it's it's I think a really cool way to use gen AI. Cool. So, if you can get out of this and just kind of open the second task as well because that's more of a customer-focused thing. Perfect. Yeah. So, here it's just again like different flavor of it. Here we are saying call this customer and discuss, you know, when the installation will happen and and you know, so so we can so on both the sides agents are calling providers as well. Agents are calling customers as well. So, how are we how can we use like gen AI to make them go faster? That's the main intuition behind building the solution this way. So, once we were done with all of this, we were like, why stop here, right? So, one of the other complaints which we hear from our providers is that that you guys end up calling us three times, four times in a day. So, so we decided to do this in a bulk way. So, so yeah, if we go there now, so you can see that email installer. So, so we know that today we have to this agent has to reach out to six different installers and and for different installers, they are addressing maybe more than one customer at a time, right? So, instead of calling them six times or sending them emails, you know, six times. So, so what we are doing is can we just send a combined email? So, so if you open the send combined email, so here instead, so now it's like that hey, you know, today you have these three jobs. So, we kind of use whatever we had built so far, which was, you know, helping agents kind of move faster. So, so it's like these mini boosters, one by one, you know, like a like a Lego, we are building more and more stuff with gen AI. And and and and we are hoping that this will unleash a completely different level of productivity. And and and you know, like we'll keep on moving through these projects much faster. We'll we'll be able to keep our customers way more informed. And and I think overall, just leave lead to a much better customer satisfaction ratings for these projects. So, so that was the demo for today. Hopefully, you guys enjoyed it. And now over to Annie, we were I'll take any questions, Annie, which have been asked so far, and we can kind of tack team for that. Thank you so much. We'll be now moving into a short Q&A before proceeding into how you can actually request your own customer service engine application. For those who are interested in asking a question, please go ahead and submit your questions through the chat. We're going to try to answer them live. But if not, we'll also follow up offline after. So, perhaps in the interest of time, the shot one question for you, what did you think was differentiated in building with AIP as you went from, you know, the first iteration, the V1 and then onto production? Yeah, so see the biggest call out has to be the speed. So, it was like, you know, once we got our data the way we wanted it, once we got that ontology piece built in, we were we were able to move super fast. So, so going from a POC to pilot to a national launch, I think it is one of the easiest launch, which I have seen. And I think it's just because there's no like once the data is available and palatable, there's no like no more middleware involved, you know, infrastructure is already available. So, so NRAG, that's at least what I would say that, you know, like and in general, like you're taking feedback from the business, from pilot, quickly bringing it to the screens directly, getting them like super comfortable with that because we need their buy into do a national launch. So, I think that was at least my favorite part of the whole thing, that how quickly we were able to get through this. That's awesome. Thank you so much in the Sean and thanks for your time. I know we have a few more questions, a lot of interest of folks wanting to see under the hood of the customer service engine. And so, perhaps with that, I'd like to hand it over to my colleague Usive, who can actually give a demo, what is the AIP customer service engine and, you know, what does one get? They were to request this application. Before we get into the demo, just a quick couple of slides on what the customer service engine actually is. And thank you, Nishant, for sharing your experience. We're also excited to see what comes next for Lowe's. And for everyone else on the call, you know, having heard from Lowe's being the first mover in their industry with AI and building the customer service transformations that you saw. Hopefully, everyone's feeling energized and inspired by the potential that AI can bring in this space. And I want to tell you that this impact and energy is not just confined to the retail industry. Lowe's are the first mover in that space, but equally our partners across a range of industries are building their own customer service AI use cases. And in building this and putting these in production, we've been able to find common patterns that are required to put such a use case in a production-ready setting. And we've distilled that into the product that we're launching today, which is the AIP customer service engine. It's packed with features, but to name five that I think are completely differentiated from anything else that's out there is number one, the AIP customer service engine is built to learn the context of your business and the needs of your customers. And it does that through interactions and feedback from your expert operators, your people. Secondly, it's not a black box. It comes with the best AI engineering tool kit that's out there today. So your engineers can pull the hood, look underneath head and touch the engine itself. Thirdly, it's interoperable with any kind of target architecture that you might already be building with AI. You can plug this into a custom React app and use it as a chatbot, or you can build something more complex and operationally relevant like what Nishan showed. Fourth, it's not going to be complex to connect this with your data sources. The AI is only as good as the data that you plug into it. We take that really seriously here. So we've shipped this with over a hundred different connectors to pull data from any source at any scale. And finally, it comes with a built-in analytics engine to make it easy for you to track KPIs and set targets on things like ticket resolution times, customer satisfaction, and do that in real-time fashion. And speaking of business value, the sky is the limit of what's possible here, but some of the immediate value drivers are efficiency gains through reduced ticket resolution time, reduction in repeat queries because it's not just responding faster, it's responding more accurately with the entire context of your business. And similarly, it's responding in a more tailored fashion to the customer that's creating the query by having access to the customer 360 data asset. And finally, you can even plug this into your cross-selling, upselling machines and drive the customer lifetime value up. So now you might be thinking, okay, AI produces business value, what's new? The thing that's new here is it's not business value that you get a quarter from now. This is business value that's available to you immediately. And that's what AIP now is. So the first thing you get out of this is it completely bootstraps your first production version of a customer service AI. And there are three key building blocks to that. The first one is an out-of-the-box customer service ontology, which comes with concepts like a customer, their transactions, their orders, and much more. This is your enterprise truth. The second building block here is a pre-configured AI agent that is a tailor-made to triage in result cases. And it is deeply embedded into the ontology. So it's embedded and anchored into your enterprise knowledge and updates as that knowledge graph updates. And then finally, it puts your people front and center of the workflow. So the expert operators who've been doing this for years and years and know your business and your customers well, they become the people who check the AI's homework. They approve the responses that the AI is generating and when the experts responses are not accurate, they can give it feedback so the AI can learn and improve over time. That feedback is also captured and stored in the ontology. So you get that on day one, but you don't have to stop there. This is a framework that you can use to expand the the customer service engine and plug it into your own organization. Firstly, you can extend the ontology by connecting to data sources and bringing in more data. Secondly, you can orchestrate actions. It comes with about 20 pre-built actions, but it also comes with blank canvas that you can use to build your own actions. For example, you might want the AI agent to have the power to update orders in your OMS system or send diagnostics to SAP to your ERP such as SAP. And really, the sky is the limit here. And finally, it comes with AI engineering workbench that allows your engineers to find here and configure the AI agent itself. It's prompting which LLM is using and much more. I'll hand over to Yusuf now to make all of this real through a demo. Yusuf, take it away. Hi, everyone. Thank you for being here. My name is Yusuf. I'm part of the AIP Customer Service Engine team here at Palantit. And today, I am super proud to introduce you to the Customer Service Engine on AIP now. What I'm about to show you is a suite of capabilities, including the operator app, as we saw Nishan show, but also everything behind it. And it's important to understand these are configurable for your business. So let's get into the operator app. Great. So on the left here, you can see our customer queries. These can come in through phone, email, text, web submissions. On the right, you can see our organizational data, information about our order. And in the middle, you can see our AI agent generating these actions. So for this one, we're being asked to give a realistic ETA, here's the query. And our AI agent has been able to interpret that, understand that we need to respond with an email, search the organizational data to provide a meaningful detailed and up-to-date response. And this is going to really help our L1 customer service, but we can move past better responses into actually solving the customer solution, solving the customer query. So let's go to our next one. Here we can see a request to postpone the order date. This is asking us to do something. Our AI agent is able to interpret the request, look through the library of actions, and select the modified delivery date action. And again, using the request is able to use that context to pre-fill the modified delivery date with the correct date for the next available order slot. So I can approve that. And next thing I want to do and update my order, I can see here, that's written back to my ontology, my data, written back to my systems. The next thing I want to do is update the customer. So again, this personalized email using the ontology, using the context, we're able to approve and send that and communicate with our customer, update them on the most up-to-date view of their order. But that's not the whole story with the customer service engine. Let's go under the hood and see what's driving it. So this is the engine room. These are the data and actions feeding our operator app. But it's important to know, while it's feeding our operator app here, it can also feed an external web application. So you can take the power of customer service engine with you wherever you need it. Let's go to our next query. As you can see, as I'm clicking through the application, I can see how the operator app is drawing upon the organizational data stored in my ontology. That's because the answer to the customer query isn't blowing in the wind, it's actually stored in the ontology. Let's have a closer look. So the customer service engine gets shipped with a customer service ontology. This includes alerts, order events, customer, and the actual order itself. If we click here, we can see that the order is being backed by a data set. This could be any data set in your organization. As Annie mentioned, we have hundreds of data connectors with data connector and we have pipeline builder, which allows you to integrate your data in minutes. And we can cover that in future sessions. But for now, let's go back to the operator app. This is an operational application. That means our users are making decisions. To make those decisions real, we need to give them actions. In this case, our customers asked to cancel the order. This is the opportunity to use the cancel order action. So here, I can select cancel order, confirm it, and see that right back to my systems, actually update something. This is an action. An action can be anything from deleting your order to updating the date, to writing back to external systems to generating maintenance supports. And our orders aren't fixed. We can add, sorry, our actions aren't fixed. We can add actions. And that's because our customers queries aren't fixed either. So this customer service engine allows you to define your own actions for your AI agent to use. But we can also have AI enabled actions. So this is AIP logic. This is where we're defining our email agent action. Here we can see the prompt. We're giving access to our data and we're giving it the context. And when it's running, we can see this chain of thought, how it's working through the customer query, the alert up here. And it's using these tools, using these actions to generate the next response. And here is our output. Right. So we have this symphony of data and actions all being orchestrated by our AI agent. But we're missing something. We're missing it because it's not your customer service engine yet. We're missing the sheet music to our organization, our processes. Now this is held in many ways, but often it's some process documents. So we can move here into our ontology and we can see some SOPs. And what's backing that are PDFs. And these PDFs can store our SOPs, our process documents, and we're able to pass those PDFs and store them in ontology and make them available for our AI agents to use. But not all process knowledge is able to be written down. There's a certain kind of knowledge, call it tacit knowledge, tricks of the trade, tribal knowledge, things that you only learn speaking to customers on the ground solving their problems day in, day out. And this kind of knowledge is hard to learn but even harder to write down. But it's important to making the customer service engine ours. So we can see how we capture that in customer service engine. If I move back to our application into this request, I can see a customer's asking about their shipment. So I can look at the email, looks pretty good, I'm ready to send, but I've just catch that actually this order is for an L shape desk, which is a piece of furniture. And I know in my organization that needs a signature. So I'm going to edit the response here. I'm going to say please make sure someone is into sign. And what's going on here is I'm editing my email to make it a better response. I'm using that experience. But actually my feedback agent is also capturing that, is capturing that learning. And I can tag this because this is relevant to the product category and submit that feedback, submit my change and send that email to the customer. But what's going on here is we're capturing that as tribal knowledge and storing it in our tribal knowledge store. Here we can see that exact piece of feedback I gave to customer service agent. And for any future furniture requests, I will have this context. So here's a pre-existing one to remind our loyal customers about their loyalty points. If I move to our next query, I can see that this customer, John Smith is a law customer. And the email we've generated has included the point about loyalty points. This is how feedback works in action. So that's a brief overview of the customer service agent. It's ready to use out the box and you can incrementally make it your own. It fits in with your existing systems. It can ingest data and it can also write back to those source systems. And you can also deploy these capabilities on an external web app. I'm super excited to see how you guys use it. And it feels like a really good day to be a customer. Thank you, Yusuf. So for our attendees, hopefully everyone got a flavor of what the customer service engine is and what it can try for your organization. But we also recognize that the true potential of enterprise AI can only be gaged if you get hands-on keyboard. So today we're offering exclusive access to anyone on this call to get access to the customer service engine. Just scan that QR code on the slide and register interest. Once you have access, you can make it your own. Expand the backing data, the ontology. Configure your AI agent, look under the hood, create actions, create guardrails for the AI, and build confidence that this is real AI for your enterprise. And then deploy the AI solution. Bring this to prod in your enterprise like Lose Have and generate outside impact. Cool. We'll go to Q&A. I think we have about five minutes left. So have to take any questions and rug all yours. Great. So it seems like we have quite a few questions coming in. So I'm going to try to make sure we capture as many of those live. Perhaps one of the most more common ones that I'm seeing is a question around how does the AIP customer service engine compare with other CRM forms like Salesforce and Dynamics? I can take that one. In most implementations, it extends those platforms where those platforms become the backing data source and this becomes the intelligence layer and the AI layer on top of it. We ship this with connectors to both of those systems and more, like I said, over 100 systems to pull data and write back data as operations are happening on the different customer cases and tickets and so on. Awesome. And then perhaps one last question and then maybe we should put back the slide with this sign up QR code. How can we attend a bootcamp? This is multiple ways of attending a bootcamp. You could follow the link behind this QR code and request a bootcamp. You could also go to valenture.com and sign up for a bootcamp and someone for valenture will be in touch with you. Awesome. Thank you so much everybody. I know there are quite a few questions that we still haven't answered. One thing I'll take away is make sure we follow up offline with anyone who has submitted a question we haven't had a chance to answer. But once again, thank you so much for joining. I hope everyone is able to get a chance hands-on access to the AIP customer service engine. Thanks all.
