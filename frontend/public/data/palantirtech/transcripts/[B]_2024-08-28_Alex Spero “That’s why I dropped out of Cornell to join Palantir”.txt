TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Yeah, so my name is Alex Spiro. I am now a Delta here, Palantir, but my origin story is that I originally was born in Indiana because my parents were on a business trip, but I actually ended up living in New York for the first few years of my life. So I first lived in Great Neck and Ireland and then I lived even further down in the middle of nowhere, part of Lang Island for a year. And then when I actually entered elementary school, I moved to Allen Town, Pennsylvania, which is now where I call home, a really big fan of that place and went to a normal public high school there. And in terms of college, I didn't get in anywhere pretty much for like so long until May when I pretty much begged Vanderbilt to accept me and then they did. So I was super exciting. So I went to Nashville, went to Vanderbilt for a year before I ended up transferring to Cornell because I sort of wanted to be close at home and I also wanted more of a focus on engineering. So that's where I was for the fall semester of 2023. And then I was there for one semester and ended up hearing about this internship balance here. Took semester off. Really loved the internship. And now I am here full time and in the nutshell it's my whole story. But yeah. Well, awesome. So you came here for an internship and now you're here full time. Was that the plan that you would kind of finish the internship and then just join as a full time employee? Yeah, no, not at all, not at all. Like I originally came into the internship because I thought it would be a great opportunity, like learn more about pounds here, like sort of solve the world's hardest problems. But I just really loved it. And along the way I began thinking like, hey, I can really see myself doing this for a while. And towards the very end of it, I realized that this might be something more valuable. Like this might be more valuable than going back to school. So after some tough decision making eventually we got here and a full time. So you came for an internship and stayed for a job. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you can talk a bit about what kind of things weighed into that decision for you to stay here instead of going back to school. Yeah. So I think it came down to like three main things. I talked to a lot of different people about us. I talked to my mom. I talked to people around me. I talked to Ted even, like, kind of conversation with him. And I think everyone would brought, like, there's three main things. So the first thing was sort of like, you know, you want to go to school, you want to just get your degree. It's like a safe thing to do. You know, what if the economy crashes and you won't have a degree? So sort of on that, I understand that point of view for sure. But I think for me, I sort of want to work in a place where the degree, the degree doesn't matter as much. So I think I love to volunteer and they don't care about the degree. And any other type of place I'd want to work would be sort of work similar to doing now or like a startup space where a degree probably wouldn't matter as much. So for me, like, it felt like the importance of a degree just really just really wasn't there. Sort of the next thing was, it's like it's sort of just like the default to go back to school and it's like you can only go to college once, you know, have that experience. And sort of we like break that out. It's like, you know, like the social aspect of college is like super important. And I think like that was like the ultimate thing that I was deciding between because, you know, I do have a lot of special people there I want to be with and friends I want to see. But I think I can also like, I've found like a lot of special people here and made like a lot of cool connections here. So I think that sort of part is definitely like the most impactful and like my reason for almost going back. But I think at the end of the day I can, I can say like maintain those connections while not being at school and like being here a palancer and forming like new ones. You know, also we live in New York City like there's so many people I can meet here. And then sort of the last thing was like the default thing to do is like to go back to school. In terms of that, so I think a lot of people, you know, assume like, you know, this is just like what you do at this point in time of your life. I think for me, I was really loving like the work that I was doing here at Palantir. Like I work in hospitals and I really think like the time to be in Palantir is like now on the time to be working in hospitals is now I think the problems that I can celebrate here are super hard and super cool and like super impactful. So I really love that versus like when I'm at Cornell, sort of most of the problems I do are like in textbooks and you know, they're intellectually stimulating, but it's not, I would say very impactful or very useful a lot of times at the end of the day. Whereas here every problem I solve means you know a patient's life could be saved or just could be better. So I think like those three things, let's see if I recap them about you know, it being the default and like the work you do, the social aspects and then like the value of the degree, like all of those sort of combined into like my decision to like stay at Palantir. Like I love that people here love the work here and you know, the degree, I don't really need it here. So I think I'll be good. So that's sort of like what would I do it? Sweet. So I mean if your ultimate goal is to work at Palantir, then you've made it right. Yeah, exactly. That's pretty cool. You know, had Palantir always been on your radar? How did you first hear about us and the program you mentioned? Yeah. So funny story. I actually heard about Palantir in like 2020 when I invested some stock into it, but besides that I had no idea really anything about or knew anything about Palantir at all. I actually initially heard about it my fall semester at Cornell. Like when I was sort of applying to internships, I was doing my, my Algo piece set of course with some of my friends. I was in like the center for Jewish living. It was like 8 p.m. on like a Tuesday or something like that. And we were all just doing our Algo homework together. And then one of my friends like walks down the stairs and he goes to see what Palantir just tweeted and I said, no. And he goes, you know, they're having this program for like Jewish students or anyone facing anti-Semitism on campus. And this of course is at a time there's a lot of like anti-Semitism going around. So I was like, wow, it isn't incredible. This is a great opportunity. You know, I've never felt, you know, targeted by an internship ever. So this was like crazy for me. And I was like, I was just looking at the application and said, take a semester off. They were like, you sure you want to take a semester off? I said, dude, of course, I'd love to work at Palantir. I didn't know much about the company, but you know, based on the website, it seemed pretty cool and pretty exciting. So I applied and you know, I just interviewed like very late December through January. I actually like interviewed with his name is Celia, I had his interview on Christmas Day. But since we're both Jewish, it didn't matter. So it was pretty funny to see that. It was kind of cool to know that there was a lot of that Jewish support here at Palantir. And yeah, I interviewed and then the day after New Year's January 2nd, I got my off friends within a few weeks, I was already in DC. So super quick and also just super like spontaneous that it all happened. So hearing about that timeline, it must be pretty recent you've made the decision to stay. When did this happen? Yeah, yeah, to stay at Palantir full time, that decision happened I think on Sunday, which was three days ago when I officially signed, but probably last week, so like seven days ago, we were in like real talks of like potentially staying here full time. It was super, super recent for sure. So you're still figuring out living situation? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right now I'm currently on one of my TLS's beds because he's in Scotland for the week. So it's great, I have a bed, I'm not even crashing on a couch, I feel really blessed for that. But yeah, I mean, hopefully I'm going to get a temporary housing on Friday. We'll see how it goes. If not, maybe Saturday, maybe Sunday, who knows? That stuff will hopefully work out and have a good feeling at well. But yeah, I mean, who knows? I still have to get a real apartment too after that. So we'll find a place somehow, you know? This is the most palantirian thing I've heard that you've joined Palantir and you're sleeping on like luckily another palantirian's bed, not so far. Yeah, great. Okay, well I won't take too much more of your time, but I did want to close out, you know, we spoke very briefly before this. And I kind of commented on how relaxed you are kind of in the decision in this sort of state of flux. Do you have anything to say on that, like sort of resiliency that you seem to have? Yeah. So I think this like, resilience you say is sort of broken up into like two points, like sort of like right, not like what you're saying right now. It's like coming to Palantir for me is like a big decision versus like me, like finding a place to live is like a super small decision. And I think for me like the big decisions that I think are like more risky definitely comes from my dad, like he was an entrepreneur and like, you know, he always told me, you know, in life it's, you know, some people are going to be super risk averse, but it's sometimes good to take like risks, not take stupid risks, like not jump off a bridge and like can go cliff diving. But like, you know, take take this as like a calculated smart risk to drop out of college and like come to Palantir. So I fully like felt like this was a good risk to take. And, you know, so I sorry, I'm doing it in terms of like other stuff like that, like where I'm going to live, you know, what else I'm going to do in New York. Like I think that's sort of more of a me thing. Like that stuff will all like just figure itself out at the end of the day. And I don't know, there's really no reason to like stress over stuff like that. Like I want to put in the effort to try and find a house of course. Like I'm not just going to like magically get a house one day. For stuff like that, I think as long as you put in the effort, it'll sort of come to you. So there's no reason like crazy stress about stuff like that. And even on this like super risky decision to come to Palantir, like, you know, I've been a little nervous, I guess, like decided like is this the right thing to do is this the wrong thing to do. But at the end of the day, you know, you make the decision and then in a few months or in a year, you can look back and be like, hmm, maybe this was a good decision or, you know, maybe not, not a good one. But you know, as for the time being, it seems like a great decision to me. So here I am. Awesome. One final one, I know I said that before. What do you think you mentioned your dad? Yeah. So my dad is like pass away last year and June, but I don't know, you're fine, you're fine. But you know, I think he would have thought I was a good decision. I don't know, he was always super supportive like what I wanted to do. And at the end of the day, like he didn't have like a real college degree either. Like he had sort of different degrees, but he didn't go to a standard college. So, and he did just great. So I think you would have been really okay with the decision. And in terms of my mom, she's sort of like, you know, she sort of trust me with these decisions. Now I think, you know, maybe you decide to transfer Cornell as like a risk for her or like, you know, other bigger decisions in life. She sort of lets me handle it now. I'm like, just trust me to make the right call. And in case someone goes wrong, like she's always there to support him like we can, you know, figure something out. But yeah, I'd say like my mom definitely supports and I think my dad would have too.
