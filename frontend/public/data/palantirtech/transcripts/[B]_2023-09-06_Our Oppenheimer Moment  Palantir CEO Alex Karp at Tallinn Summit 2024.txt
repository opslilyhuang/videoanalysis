TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

So, hello and welcome. It's excellent and distinguished. It is my privilege to introduce you, Dr. Alexander Carp, CEO of Pellatine. You are a co-founder of this company. And before that, you had a quite distinguished academic career. Which... It wasn't distinguished. It was academic. Well, at the end of the day, you became lawyer. You became a doctor of philosophy in Germany, starting also under Urikan Habermanns, who's really famous philosopher. And you were active as well in the fitness area. You do martial arts as an understanding you swim, and you do cross-country skiing, which is a big thing in a stony. I'm a cross-country ski addict. Yes, I'm quite good. We can all go cross-country skiing at some point. It's not very popular actually in America, because if you want to have a sport that's successful in America, you have to have an after-party. There's no after-party in cross-country skiing, because... Yeah, there's after-party in Kroke. Well, you can help cross-country skiing, because in America, we suffer because... You need to maintain a high cardio and strength basis. And then if you do Alpine, you kind of go downhill, and my impression is you smoke and drink and have fun. And if you're doing cross-country skiing, you go to sleep and get up early. But, yeah, there's a lot of advantages to cross-country skiing. At the finish of Storquemartaton, we drink butter beer. So basically, we do off-road. Well, that can work too, yeah. So there are two similarities between us. One is A to avoid trouble and jail. We have to be really careful what we say in public. Second one is we both love cross-country skiing. So you're... You're classic or skating or both? Both. It depends on the snow. That's the range, yeah, yeah. So you are one of the first CEOs to go down to Kiev last year and offer your support. So how has the AI actually impacted the battlefield in your opinion? Well, there's an official version of AI in the broader space, which was really large language models, convincing people that technology was relevant, that it could help them with homework and poetry, and they could wrap like a wrapper, except for they're not a wrapper. But the real beginning of the AI revolution really started a number of years ago, using... It's kind of obvious, but when people say AI, what they really mean are... Currently, mostly, I mean large language models, but there are, you know, large-scale, algorithmatic utilities of software, which are AI, and they have the advantage of being precise. Large language models have the advantage of being able to gather information from all over the world, but are not precise. What happened on the battlefield was that you saw a small power with negligible investment in hardware doing much better than it should, based on technical, acuity, and instruments. And the interesting thing about technology is, in buying large technology doesn't lead to societal change until there's a galvanizing moment where people really believe it can make a difference, meaning life or death or your business goes out of business. And I, before the war, there was certainly a sense in, we have a global business, so in every market we're in, that software AI was kind of a luxury product. If you were geeky or unpopular, you would kind of, you know, get involved in it. But otherwise, you could kind of just not invest in it. And I think that's, luckily for the West, that was the approach of our adversaries. On top of that, what happens in these countries is where things look like they're fraudulent, like their view of technology, probably the fraudsters grifted on it, took all the money and put it in their bank account. So, it really led to a very surprising moment. And then that combined with large language models coming on the scene has basically changed the world. A world where hardware dominant industry with very light software, which light is being a euphemism for maybe basically non-existent, where the dominant players in the world, this had some huge advantages for the Western Alliance, because in general, Europe is a dominant player in hardware, and America is a dominant player in software, with exceptions, they're phenomenal software companies outside of America, and there are phenomenal hardware companies inside of America. But if you had to generalize, that would be the generalization. And what has happened now is, and then inside of America, you have the problem that most of the software companies that are relevant are really West Coast-based. And we moved to Colorado, which is also on the West Coast, but this moving from this is a joke, when we started 20 years ago, and we were building products for Intel agencies, really everyone outside the Intel Indonesia thought that these products were non-relevant. Basically, maybe useful for a narrow use case, but wouldn't change the world. Despite the fact they did. I mean, I think Europe would be very different if the terror attacks that have been stopped by many people in this room, in many cases using our product, you would have a different populist landscape. But in any case, it's now center on everyone's mind, and how to negotiate this, especially in the work context, is arguably the most important thing we can all think about. So, my Ukrainian colleagues told me, at Cybercommanders forum, that war changes everything. So it means that we have the privilege and time to kind of make those changes in advance. So what's your kind of take on, how do you see that AI will change the relative kind of power of different countries? Well, there's different forms of AI. So internal surveillance, we should avoid, and we should use AI and software to limit the scope and intrusive nature of internal surveillance on our citizens. In fact, you have to fight weapons with weapons, so people who understand how surveillance actually works, technical actors with legislative interests have to write the legislation to guarantee us the maximum amount of freedom we, in the West. And that freedom includes the right to be forgotten, the right to request to be forgotten. I tend to be, there's many different ways of looking at civil liberties. I still am probably mostly, in Europe, you're focused on consumer and government. I'm much more concerned about what the government sees and how they use it. Can it be used in surveillance under what conditions can it be used to prosecute, can it be used to defame you? So limiting the scope of that is also a technical endeavor and has to be done by people actually understand this, and who are non-politicized, which is a problem. We had a vibrant civil liberties community in America that still exists, but it's often, you know, Republicans are bad, Democrats are good. I'm more on the Democratic side, but you need nonpartisan people to do this. And then you have an issue, which is that, if you just look at it from the American perspective, the West Coast is the dominant player. Almost every, almost not all providers of this technology come from the West Coast. So even in America, you have to negotiate a number of people asking for governance, which I support, are actually just interested in not buying the best product. You have in Europe, Europe has regulation. Europe is obviously a big country in large countries. I do think that there's a somewhat of a division of interest there because it is maximally in the interest of Europe to both foster its industry and make it possible for companies to export their software. But it's absolutely imperative for the small countries, and it's in a massive advantage for the small countries, because you don't need, with the correct implementation of software, you can outmaneuver the large countries on the battlefield or on the economic field. This country has just a huge advantage as do countries in this region, because there's the legislation, but then to quote, Dirkheim, on the crack-trial thing is there's the preconditions of the contract. So you can have the legislation, but do people really still buy the best product, or do they buy the local product? I'm here to tell you, if you buy the product, that's not the best you will lose. And then you have the question, well, how do you identify the real product? And I can tell you exactly what I tell people in America. There are the leaders of this field, you must be in contact with them. The good news for Europe is a lot of the leaders in that field are European. The bad news is many of them are living in America. So you must talk to them. Talking to your local provider, whether that's your local provider in DC, who's never heard of a large language model, or it's your local provider, that's necessary, but it's to use it overused term, it's not sufficient, because unlike the revolutions of the past, the difference between the person you know and the person who's best is the difference between winning and losing a war. And this is just a massive shift. And the people who understand this will outperform the people who ignore this are going to do very poorly. America does have a huge advantage. We have a lot of political craziness. You may not be aware of it. But the fact that the GDP of America is going to increase, it already has increased to be the Europe quite a bit, which is a cause for concern. Because it's easier and the adoption is much, much quicker, especially in the industry, in the military context also. And then there's a question of how do we know? Then these are our adversaries. Look, China, which I think is, and that's something that Europeans have to pay attention to. America has shifted from a country that where I think I'm the only reasonably prominent person I know that has an educational background in Europe. And this would have been different 50 years ago, 30 years ago, that does not exist. America does not have the emotional connection to Europe it once had. And so that's another reason I think small countries are particularly important because you have to go to America and explain what's going on. It's not the case anymore that Americans are as focused on what's happening here is emotionally, and that will affect the politics over time. But America is very focused on China. And then the question is what are Russia and China doing? They're behind, but we have to be very focused on America because they won't stay behind very long. Simply because while we have the better technology players, they have leadership that's very friendly, that navigates engineering structures arguably as well or better than we do. I would say especially in the case of China, that there's a huge, it's very hard for humanities people and engineers to actually communicate. And that's something all Western societies struggle with. And that gives say China an advantage because they don't that's not an issue that they they have as much. On the other hand, they focus most of their efforts on internal surveillance and the actual selection technologies, which are a hybrid of LLMs and algorithms are being produced in the West. So some of the people who are advocating that we should boss the development of AI, what's your kind of take on that? You know, it's very easy to talk in absolute terms. We live in on the battlefield in relative terms, meaning in absolute terms. Of course, I typically have two camps, those that say it's dangerous and those that say it's safe. And if you're going to arguably different camp, I think these technologies are potentially dangerous and the dangers are obvious. Even if you don't get to general AI where the AI takes over, there are real surveillance dangers that we should all be afraid of and working against. We should you should have the right to have a personal life, your health, your private affairs. These things should not be things that the government has easy or arguably consumers, consumer, companies have access to or in an unregulated way. But I think the debate is very academic because the basis of our civilization, I believe, is that the West imposed technological superiority and through that technological superiority garnered the rule of law human rights. The flaw in the logic, at least in the, I would say Western context, is many people believe that the rule of law and human rights are ifso facto in an automatic way, something that appears and we internalize them because they are a superior way to live. I believe there are superior way to live, but I believe that they were adopted because people saw that the people who build the best rockets, the best bombs, the best cars, the built safety devices also believed in this ethical framework. And therefore people equated the ethical framework with technological innovation and growth. If you believe that, those are a series of assumptions that many people, most people I do not believe, the logical consequence is that these technologies are dangerous, but we have to be ahead because otherwise our adversaries will be ahead. And the framework that they want to live in is not a rule of law, not a human rights. For all the problems we have in the West, there are no other places where you can be as experienced as little discrimination, as little bias, as little unfairness as Western countries. So I'm not saying we're perfect, but I do think we're the best in perfect societies that have ever existed. And this is why not to go offline. I think the fundamental erosions of the West are where people inside Western countries or outside Western countries believe we're not delivering on innovation and things that help economies grow. And therefore adopt what I would view as more progressive policies and views and vote for those people. So I think the progressive classically defined approach requires heavy investment in these technologies, especially in the military context, and coalitions of partners, both partners and translators. And I would say if we're being optimistic, I've been saying this for 20 years and mostly got yelled at. Now I only get yelled at every two days, not every day. So I think people are moving towards this not because of the persuasiveness of my arguments, but because of the persuasiveness of the actions of our adversaries, which always exploit weakness. And there is no, there's like we have a raging debate in America about all these issues. My only simple point is you can be right on all the issues. But if you miss the point that our adversaries will always and ruthlessly exploit internal and external weakness, you just, you've won every point, but you've lost the argument. So you've had over 20 years of experience actually implementing those solutions. So what's the role of Palantir and what's the advice to over distinguished guests here? So kind of how do you employ or kind of introduce effective AI solutions and mitigator call your children, ask them who the smartest tech person is and get them to work for you. You know, I can make the pat look, I think our products are unique. We've proven they're unique. We're a successful company. You need accurate information. I could give you accurate information, but you might have trouble believing me because I'm also selling a product. So don't believe me. You have and find the person, the best person you can find is the smartest person who's worked at a company that's world class in this area. There's a famous meme in America that's, I think it's wrong. It's like you win by failing and failing and failing until you win. But in reality, you learn by being an organization that's had major setbacks and then wins. And there's subtle difference. You don't really want to call the person who's had 50 failures. You want to call the person who's had a company or an organization that has had major setbacks and then the end one. You want to identify people who've been at those companies who you trust, so from your country. And you want to put them very close to you and ask them, who's real, who's not. Otherwise, you're going to get a lot of conflicting interests and you're going to make the wrong decision about who to work with, what products to buy, what products to implement, who to avoid. So I know this is not, I know your job's are to talk to everybody and you do a great job of that. I'm here to tell you, identify a couple people and talk to them regularly. And then you have to have a business or military specific use case with a very tight timeline. And one of the advantages small countries have and a relatively small budget. One of the dangers we have in big countries around this is we start, in the end you will need some, you will need sums that are real. But in the beginning you need to identify the players that are real and have enough money just to get them going and to actually test what's working. You need to be personally involved. One of the mistakes we have, we're running off time, we have all over large organizations, not governments, but any large organization is they're built for a hardware world. In the hardware world you had the CEO and the tech person and they didn't like each other, they avoided each other as much as possible. And then you know, honestly probably tried to get each other fired the whole time. And then you see who wins and the only winner are the lousy results. That software world presupposes the person in charge gets involved in the tech issues. You don't have to be technical but you have to understand what is the business, what is the military outcome we want, what is the timeline, cut that timeline in half. Because if the people are actually delivering a product, they're actually influencing, they need 10% of the time that they say they do. And flatten your hierarchy. Now this isn't possible across a large organization tomorrow but you can take a subset of organization and start with accurate ingredients, who's good, who's not. Flat in the hierarchy, define the business use case, cut the business time in by at least two, offer that a small amount of money with a larger amount if it's successful and run, don't walk. And you can have a world class software empowered organization. If you violate any of those steps, you will invariably spend a lot of money. And the first way you will know you've gone wrong is you will hear from the person, this is going to work out but we need twice as much time and four times as much money. That's when you pull the plug. So I think good show and good interview ends well when people want to hear more. So I think you have succeeded in that. So thank you Dr. Carp from the applause space. Thank you.
