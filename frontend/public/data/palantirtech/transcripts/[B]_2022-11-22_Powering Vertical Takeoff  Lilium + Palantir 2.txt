TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning, it's a pleasure, it's a honor to be here with you today. So I'd like to thank Schum and his team for giving us a chance to tell you who we are at Lillium, what we do and how we partner with Palantinia to do it better and faster. So what we're doing at Lillium based in Germany is basically building radically better ways of moving. That's ambitious. So why is that radical? First, we fly, we want you to fly. And that's great, I mean most of us fly, but not the majority of humanity. Point A to point B. So I'm talking about London downtown to Heathrow. I'm talking about JFK to downtown New York. I'm talking about sailing hours of traffic. So that's radically different. The second thing is that it's sustainable. While we're in the air, we don't create emissions, it's electric. Wow, that's different. So no emissions, no pollution, less guilt. Yeah, that's better because we'd better think about it as we just heard. So it's sustainable. And the last thing is for everybody. It's not for the wealthy people. It's for everybody. It has potential to reach a price point which makes it competitive with a taxi service because it's very simple. So how simple is it? Well, that's the solution we are defining and building. It's a jet. It's actually a jet. It's electric. And it takes off vertically so you can reach the basically the downtown of cities. You can go into very small footprint. In fact, it's a helicopter pad. And the good news about it is it's ducted fans, electric fans. So it's not noisy. Take some Francisco, more than 30 different helicopter pads. Almost all of them have been shut down because of noise. So much less noise, safer than helicopters because it has redundancy. All these multiple engines. And that might also lot. And zero emission. Zero emission. That matters a lot too. Wow. So that's what we want to bring to the world. And that's what we work on. Now, it has to be accessible to everybody. So we didn't want to. If you, some of you which have flown a helicopter, it's not a pleasant experience always. So we wanted also to make sure that everybody can have a pleasant experience inside. Commercial development and basically being ubiquitous around the world means that it has to be a good passenger experience. So the cabin has to be basically configured in a way that is accessible. Accessible for everybody, even people which are physically impaired. And that's the condition we gave ourselves. So it's ready for everybody. Right. So that's what we're doing. We're actually doing that. We're start up 900 employees based in Munich. But aerospace innovation is extremely demanding. And I know that I spent nearly two decades at Airbus. Was ahead of quality for the H350 aircraft, which most of you have flown. It's pretty safe aircraft. It's exactly about that. Bringing innovation to aerospace is almost noxymoron. Because it has to be safe. Yeah, we don't want to create a use case for the insurance company we just saw this morning. We don't want that. Yeah, not adding one more risk because you say, oh my god, and I'm in London and then suddenly I have the risk of this flying stuff just falling on my garden or my house. No. So how do we make it safe? Well, safety standards, there are regulators to do that. We can't fly commercially if we don't have the approval for regulators. We happen to be sat in Europe with the most stringent regulator in the world, EASA, European Aviation Safety Agency. Well, they decided for this new breed of aircraft, it's going to be safe, 10 to the minus 9. Exactly the same type of safety standard that we get for commercial aircraft. Now you feel safer. You step into that. You step into a H320 or Boeing 787, same level of safety. So we get into the nano safety, right? Nano-metals, you know, in semi-conductors, you're chasing one billion-soft-chance. And you have to demonstrate it before you get a permit to fly. That's what we're after. So it's beautiful, but inside it's pretty complex. It's kilometers of cable, it's electrical, it's new technologies, innovations. So why is re-innovating there? First and foremost, the architecture. You haven't seen an aircraft like that, have you? Well, that's innovation. It's a very difficult architecture. It's unstable by nature. It's a canal, the wings, so we have to modelize a lot of CFD. If you know about aerospace, you know about modernization. You know that fluid dynamics is not linear. So you have to generate a huge amount of data just to know where you are. And then you have to test it. Fly to make sure that the real evidence that you accumulate with tons of data is matching your model, which has tons of data. Well, that's already, you smell a use case for Palantium, right? Well, but it's not only about that, you know, it's basically now building it, operating because there will be hundreds, there will be thousands of these machines around the world. So how do you make sure that they remain safe? How do we know in which state they are? So tons of built-in sensors, which are going to accumulate a lot of data. So that's our journey. Now, intuitively, the first hurdle is the regulation, getting the approval of the regulator. So that's a journey. And we started with a farer advance in that journey. In fact, we're already building these machines. So you don't realize that there are a handful of companies like ours, which have already gone public. We got public last year on NASDAQ. And we are already bringing these machines to world. In the second half of the decade, they will be everywhere. Yeah, people say, well, that science fiction. No, it's coming. It's coming faster than you imagine. Everywhere, everywhere around the world. If you check this industry, EV told, electrical, vertical, tech off and landing. Google it, you will see it's everywhere. All right, so we're one of them. We tend to be one of the most equitient terms of engineering workforce and experience, et cetera. Right. And we are based in Europe and ASI is very thorough and very committed to make us work. So we're an industrialization phase. So what it means, we're solving problems. We constantly solve problems. Well, good news. We're engineers. We love it. All right. And we have to demonstrate. We have solved problem. We have regulators. And they tend to be very thorough. That's our challenge. So how do we demonstrate that? Through evidences. How do you comment on that? How we basically are winning this race to safety. Winning the race to safety. It's time to safety. I spent some time in the Silicon Valley, time to market, time to volume, time to cost. Yeah, we're going to go there after. But getting to the market right now is demonstration of time to safety. It's learning fast. So our use case is somewhat different. Yeah, we will be in industry 4.0. In fact, I spent two decades at Airbus. Airbus will have a demonstration. I think later this afternoon, Airbus is a user of Palantir. And I was actually leading the first use case with Shia and his team back a couple of years ago. So yes, we're going to do acceleration of non-quality analytics to see where could be the sources of non-quality. I eat non-safety. We're going to have these massive supply chains around the world. We have already suppliers in Japan. We have suppliers in the US. We are buying semi-conductors. This is a flying laboratory. This machine is tons of electronics. Digital twin. I heard digital representation. We are building digital twin of the aircraft, but also building digital twin of the production system. Why the production system? Why do we care? Well, we do care because there is a regulator that says whether the production system itself is safe. That's interesting. So we have no need to demonstrate the machine is safe. But we have to demonstrate that the waste produced is safe. It's registered. It doesn't change. And each change has to be controlled. That's demanding. And predictive maintenance. We want to know everywhere all these machines around the world, these thousands of aircraft, where they are. Is the door okay? Is the battery pack okay? Is the flight control computer okay? We have tons of built-in test equipment that will just drop data directly without the users being aware of that. That's just basically, you know what? This is a norm today. Right. So we still want to do it from the beginning. So the beauty of being a startup, we're being an ore ecosystem. We have hundreds of business applications already. And we have to be cyber safe. By the way, I just mentioned that that's a key element of safety cyber. You don't want anybody to fly the aircraft instead of the pilot. So we're already doing that. And that's to use guess, that's almost normal now in the industry. What is a bit different is actually we innovate faster. You know, this race of time to safety is data driven. It's absolutely data driven. Couple of examples. We have a flight test. We have a demonstrator which is flying in the south of Spain. You check on our website. You can see this beautiful machine because it does exist. It flies today. We have demonstrated this flight physics. Why it works? Found the full first time in the world. Well, how do we do that? We wanted to basically fly and analyze. Every single flight is incremental. We go a bit faster. We take a tighter turn. So in aerospace language, we are augmenting the flight domain. Right. We are augmenting the flight envelope. We are proving it safe with a flight envelope. Step by step. Every single flight we have. We're streaming thousands of sensors and we just data. Our engineers have to analyze it before getting to the same. To the same, a bit more. So incremental. The time to analyze using a bit of planet here. Support with our team. Together with our team, we basically drastically reduce that time. Factor six. Faster learning. We could fly more often. We could learn faster. It's all about learning faster than new technology. Safety is about learning. Predicting. Knowing. Demonstrating. We've done the same for batteries. That's new. Battery. Has been there everywhere. There is a lithium-ion battery on 850. There is one on 787. I know that story. Yeah, it does work. But it's not the primary source of power. It doesn't happen today. So putting batteries as a primary source of power. Yeah, you have it on your test like R. But the thing is that, you know, if the battery runs flat, you just stop and you just exit. If the battery runs flat here, well, back to the use case I discussed before. So we have to modelize it. We have to demonstrate that we know how it's working. That the flight control computer, all the sensors, know the state of health, the state of charity, aging, any potential risk of terminal runaway. You don't want to have a terminal runaway when it's flying. That'd be bad news. Of course, we have to demonstrate we can contain it. That's part of the regulator. So to have to modelize all of that. And with Palantir, we've been able to test user test data, accumulate billions of data points on the sales behavior. So we can modelize it accurately. That's key part of our journey. That's an example of how we do it faster. Right? And of course, changes. This is a very integrated system. If you change something in the design on the engine, then you certainly have different aerodynamics laws on the wings, which means you have to change the structure. If you change the structure, you change your shape. If you change your shape, you change the aerodynamics laws again. So you can go inspire of development. That's a beauty of aerospace space. So all the changes are involving all our systems, PLM, production systems, CFD modeling. So how do we understand the change of changing the size of the engine? Well, it's a data game. So innovating faster, getting faster to the market, means understanding faster, getting data into insights. We have tons of engineers. We have some of the best brains in the aerospace industry. We were able to recruit. But they tend to transform data into data. That's difficult. So we're trying at the management level to get this insight and make the right decisions to get the right product on the market in a safe way. So that's our journey. We don't do it alone. So we're a small company, but we're already partnering with some of the biggest names in the industry. Why? Because, well, they want to be part of this revolution. If it all is a revolution that is coming, and we're not the only ones. So we have different partners. You see them. Honeywell recognized, like, control computer. Have you nicks more than 100 years of experience? So yeah, it's safe. We have a triple, decimality, flight control computer. Go figure out. That means that basically it's redontant, triple, triple different. Route of computing, software and hardware to make sure that all the signals are voted permanently to against one. So which means you know where you are. Handing qualities and safety. So we couldn't develop it ourselves. But we want to develop. And that's again sharing data, sharing tons of data. Same for name Denzo. Denzo is a giant in Japan, you know, the supplier of electric engines to all the Toyota cars. So they decided, hey, they fell in love with the concept. You know, they decided to bring to us a marvel of technology, a super integrated electric motor. In fact, we have 30 of them on the aircraft. And they deliver a performance which is just unbelievable. 3.7 kilograms. 110 kilowatt. Go to the mathematics and compare with your test list. Your since factors above. So all of that has to be developed fast. So time to safety means tons of data. Shared with the suppliers at the early stage. Of course we will share later in the industrial stage. And all the use cases that I've seen today are super interesting for us. We will go there and to end from supplier to customer. In fact, as we did with Airbus. Understanding that if you know your quality landscape is predominantly the biggest headache we have to solve. Every single component, production systems, stabilized, everywhere. So you can target the right safety. We will do that. But first and foremost, and what's a bit different from what we have seen this morning is this innovation faster through data. It's a quite interesting journey. So thank you very much for this opportunity. Happy to discuss later.
