TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

It was 2019. We've run the first ever European cricket league. Obviously swimming in data. We had 47 different spreadsheets. We were running our business. And I knew that we couldn't really scale. It was only because I was under the pressure of growing really fast and needing the scale. I felt it so we might not be able to scale as fast as we could unless we had a platform like Palantino work with. Now with Foundry in place, I feel as I've got like a general calm around what we do because everything's running in an automated process. We can dive in, we can see how things are moving. And that's just the incredible thing to see is because when you build something, it scales up for the next day or the next month or the next year. You don't have to go in and repatch your lease tools together all the time. They're there, they're working. We actually did 300 games in the first year pre-Foundry. And now with Foundry we were doing 1700 matches per year. And there's no way on Earth that we could do 1700 matches a year, broadcasted live on TV without Foundry. So I guess we'd have five times the head count. If I didn't have Foundry, we'd still be a scrappy startup if we didn't have Foundry. And now we've got really professional people, professional structures and this unbelievable tech stack in place to mean that we can go from 17 matches in our first year, then 300 matches and now 1700 matches. So the sheer volume is unbelievable. And now I think we're 52% of World Cricket that's broadcasted on TV. The sexy stuff is fan engagement and statistics and all that sort of stuff. But the really hard stuff is how to budget for an event, how to move an event, how to schedule an event, how to get your HR in process. And so to connect all the dots from the stats, from the fan engagement and the HR and budgeting process around being an event management business is just amazing. And what we feel now, not only scales us up, but it could be used for sports governing body, a federation, association, a franchise, teams, clubs, coaches, and like that. Everyone in the whole party of the European Cricket Network is using Foundry in Foundry every day and run all the operations through it. So yeah, volume is thanks to an epic tech stack. No other way to say it. The ontology that we've built is this digital twin of the European cricket league and that just means that anything next is possible. Literally our mission was to replace all of our legacy spreadsheets. We didn't have legacy ERP systems or any other legacy systems, but we had a lot of spreadsheets. So I just wanted to replace every spreadsheet we had one by one. Then we started with the event scheduling app that we built. Then it was budgeting, then it was a cost reporting, and then as we went, it was like we're just optimizing everything here so quickly. So now we actually have 89 apps that run everything we do. If data is the new oil, then Foundry is like the rig, the refinery, the end product, the car. It goes from turning that oil, which is data into something that I'm driving down the Autobahn really, really quickly. So it just goes the whole way. This is a life-changing, business-changing, human-changing infrastructure that just makes humans so much better than what they'd be without it.
