Welcome back to Squawk Box at the Leadership Summit in Kiwajas yesterday. I spoke with Palantir Co-Founder and CEO Alex Carp in an exclusive interview. Take a look. It's going to really crush a lot of businesses because for two reasons. One, it penteses the underlying architecture. Because if you run an algorithm or an LLM on an architecture that actually doesn't work or is crumbly or crispy or somehow is only built for one use case which is a live market, it won't work. It will also crush architectures because there will be an inability on the LLM side or on the large language model algorithm to like, how do I create a barrier between them and trust in my trusted network and the classified and non-classmen. Also, how do I have a barrier between the algorithm or large language model and decisions that are ethical, are ethics or norms or I have to trust this before I shut down this plant where I can't have everyone in every single office or every single hospital bed be of one demographic and our business is built to do that. So the other thing about large language models and quite frankly algorithms is it's just really good for America because first of all it's good for America because it's, while we struggle with like imposing trust on it and of course my company is in the business of that and we have I think enormous advantages. If you try to do this in China or Russia there are just too many things you're not allowed to research. The rules are going to be too strange and they're not going to actually be able to build this. They're very far behind the culture of for building it is not exactly there. And then it's good for America because we have great allies in Europe and we're just much quicker at adopting technologies. We all talk about open AI but obviously Google is trying to do this. Is this kind of technology ultimately become a commodity or is there something very specialized about it? Well the large language model is a lot comes down to powering the consumption. So they're going to be very very large language models. I think they are going to end up being somewhat specialized but the real value the part is going to be the intersection between your business logic, your business norms or your laws and ethics and large language models. And the people who get all those three are going to make money. Should we be scared about the power of AI, the power of these models because right now they're being used to write poetry. When they're actually can actually create a transaction or do something on the battlefield what happens? They already are. So they are very dangerous but the reason we have to continue down the path is A we have adversaries that seem to be bereft of any kind of ability to control their behavior. And B the American economy is still the most important in the world and what do we know about the American economy? It's the most adaptive. Are we at a transformative moment? I mean when you hear Sam Altman talk about the future of this, there are some who say this is like the browser back in the day. This is one of those moments we're going to look back in time and say this is it. This is this transfer. I think there are two moments honestly, somewhat ill modesty of me. The war in Ukraine and large language models have fundamentally changed the world and you cannot put this back in the box. But then there's a question is how can you trust either? So you don't want the AI in the hands of Russian and China that we have. You don't want the LOMs. What is the trust variable? I, first of all, society cares about that. It happens to make trust working, you need an autology, you need branching, all these technical terms. It exists. But the simple layman's terms is if the LOM tells me to do, to give me information on cancer research or how I should distribute hospital beds, is that what I actually do? And that requires a control function between the business, the business logic, you, ethics. What do you make of Elon Musk and some others who say there should be a six month pause or there should be a pause at all in terms of the advancement of this type of technology? If we didn't have the adversaries we'd have, I would be very in favor of pausing this technology completely. But we do. And that's why pausing is just, you can't pause it because it's a structural advantage both for LLMs and algorithms. So leaving, you know, what the, the, the, the, getting this, getting algorithms and LLMs to work in a classified context is going to take very specialized, very spout, can explain how it works. But getting the fact is this is going to be a bananza for the U.S. economy. How concerned are you about China right now? Everyone's very concerned. I know, I think we were in a conversation this morning where I referenced, you know, when we started first talking about China America and I was saying that this was not going to end well. That was a controversial statement. Now it's consensus. America is fairly unified that in its idea that, you know, that China and people running China are not acting in a way we can accept. And I think the consensus, if I had to guess in China is we're never going to get this back on the rails with America so we should up the aggression. When you think about, for example, the debate over TikTok, is that a real debate? No, because they shouldn't be, they, the idea that we allow a, a, a product that is really main purposes to degrade American intelligence, while not allowing American products to work in China, just factually absurd. And you know, it's really interesting. I mean, I'm very pro American democracy, but we have to get better at simple decisions. This is actually a simple decision. We have one country that allows a, another country that's adversarial to put essentially a technology in place to sole purposes to make us slower and worse. And we're not allowed to do the same on the other side. But obviously this should be either we both get to do it or neither side gets to do it. But do you think that is, that's, is that a national security concern? There are lots of national security concerns. I'm saying there's a common sense element here. Even country allows X, the other country doesn't. Let's just start with a very common sense. We both get to do it or neither side gets to do it. Let's talk about your business. There has been some pressure on the stock, as you know. You're coming off for first quarter where you achieve profitability on a gap basis. You said you expect generator profit for the fiscal, current fiscal quarter or for, for, for, for, for current fiscal year. Why do you think the stock is not moved more? Well, um, look, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of micro-fact factors there. But, honestly, if you look, think one of the few stocks where our market cap is higher than when we deep-heeled. I, we, we are not, we can't get into our current earnings or say anything that would be new. But I'm looking at a US market that's doing very, very well. And over the medium and long term, I'm a very proud holder of Pounder shares. Okay. So, as you know, Jim Kramer had some choice words for the company called it a, a company made up for memesters. Yeah. What, what do you think when you saw that? He doesn't actually look at the financials because I don't spend any time talking to him. And what I really think is you take my, uh, you take my Pounder and you take whatever anyone says about it. Let's talk about it in the year. Let, let's, let's talk about it in two years. I, uh, and, um, I'm very happy. I actually love when people attack us because it's like, great. Okay. Well, we'll show you our cards over the next couple of years. What's going to happen in two years? A lot of the questions that are being asked like how does, how does AI move from being either danger or a trinket are going to move to? Oh, these five companies, these 10 companies in the sector implemented large language models, algorithms, and did it in a way that created trust and they won the whole market. Alex Carp, uh, never one, uh, to hold back. Uh, it doesn't, doesn't hold back at all there. And has a whole bunch of views on a number of fascinating topics, Joe.
