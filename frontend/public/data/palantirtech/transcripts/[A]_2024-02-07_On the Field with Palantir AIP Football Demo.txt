Hey there, Gridiron fans and AI enthusiasts alike, I'm Chad, I'm an architect at Palantir. Today we're going to tackle something as exciting as a fourth quarter comeback how Palantir AIP can revolutionize decision making, just like a top-tier coach strategizes to win the big game, we'll dive into our platform, how it can help you call the right plays for your enterprise, using data and AI to turn the tide in your favor. Get ready to huddle up, push past the defense, score that game winning touchdown with Palantir AIP. Alright, let's get into the game plan. Today we're going to use our real-time playbook here to help us win against the owls, but first as the dragons head coach I want to share with you I think about my strategy. As in the world of enterprise like football, victory isn't about watching a scoreboard, it's about having the real-time view into what's happening, having the real-time understanding of what calls can be made, and the ability to make those calls, it's about making strategic moves with precision and foresight. The Palantir ontology is about generating alpha for winning. Now let's get back to the game. Alright let me bring up to speed on the state of the game. It's the fourth quarter, six or four left, first in ten on the dragon 21 yard line. We've got the football but we're down by four points. We had the Jetsuit bright play here that played out looked like it worked pretty well for us. So me as an ad coach I want to understand a little bit more about why. So let me pause right there and actually let's zoom in a bit, take a look. So you can see here, I can actually see Derek Square, my star running back, he's got the football. It was awesome. He was able to break out of the pocket here and get down the field. But let me take a look. So if we actually look at the telemetry data, I can see second by second the speed of the football of Derek and the acceleration. I can see that for all the players but we'll just focus on these three. So second by second you can see how the QB gets the ball, hands it off to Derek, he's able to run down the field. Awesome to see real-time his acceleration and speed, how he's able to beat everyone else out. Very cool. It will help me understand as a coach how my MVP's are playing or in my business world how my MVP's are operating. Very, very neat little secret here though. This isn't just some animated suite. This is a IP. So the data of all the players is mapped in the ontology. This is actually a real map. So you can see we've got pretty robust mapping capabilities where we can play this out in real time. This is the digital twin of the football game. Similarly, how you want to build a digital twin of your business. What's your dad's mapping software? Alright, that was pretty cool to see all the telemetry of a player, right? I mentioned it was built on the ontology. So the ontology here I've got a game and a stadium this game has teams, these teams have plays, they make play calls from a playbook. I have players that go execute them. This is the nouns and verbs that make up the game or your business. Similarly, I'm now talking in the language of the game. So if we actually look at how a player object is created, you can see there's a bunch of different data sources coming together in real time. Similarly, how you have data spread across your enterprise, I've got a bunch of different sources of data that represent what's happening to a player that then we translate into what's going on on the left. Very cool. Each one of these objects has a similar level of complexity, but all come together now talking in this business language. Cool. Playbook. Alright, we're going to call a play toss crack right. Let's call that. So what I do, this actually calls the action in the ontology. When I do it, it writes back to the ontology, but also will write back to the source system record making that the new ground truth. So I can write back to my ERP system, my transportation system, and make that go happen. I want to close that loop. This is great. We made 25 yards. Next play, triple option. Let's call that. Alright, we're marching down the field here and we'll see how this turned out for us. Very cool. So you can see now as I had coach, I have access to the data, the logic, all the different plays I can call and the actions to go make them real. This is how the ontology powers me to win. I'm not longer watching the scoreboard. I'm making the calls that matter. They're going to help you win this game. This is right. Let's keep marching down the field. Alright, we made some really good play calls. We've gotten all the way down to the fourth yard on the owls, second down, minute 22 left. This is clutch time. I'm actually going to take a time out because I want to go talk to my assistant coaches, but this wouldn't be an AIP demo without AI assistant coaches. I've got three different coaches, each one of these using a different LLM. So I've got a coach talent, very deliberate. This is using GPT-4. Coach, gust using clawed is quick and aggressive. Alt for aggressive coach Ember is using Gemini. So we're going to get a little extra context as a head coach. We can not afford to throw an interception. They all have access to the ontology that has the historical plays plus the current state that we're in. Let's go have them give me some suggestions. Alright, let's go look at the coach bench here. And so just as I wouldn't business, I go seek out expert opinions across my enterprise, give me different perspectives helping me up level my strategy. So I've already got coach Ember coming back with a play action deep post. Probably not what I want to do on the fourth yard line. He's always trying to go for it. Not what I'm looking for. Probably an interception. Alright, HP dive down the middle. It looks pretty reasonable. Okay, that's good rationale. It's conservative. Okay, let's see what coach gust has to say. Alright, inside dive. That's a pretty conservative good play too. I think I'm going to take a HP dive play here. Let's go back and make that call. Alright, there we go. And let's see how it plays out. Look at that touchdown. We win the game. This is how we up level. And we're starting to use AI plus human teaming for us to become the generative coach that wins the game. And that's final whistle. It's really been a thrill to show you how pound here. AIP can super charge your MVP's like a head coach leading a team to victory. You can leverage our platform to make the calls that count. Thanks for joining me on this winning drive. If you're ready to take your strategy to the next level, reach out. Join us in the boot camp. Until next time, keep your eye on the end zone and your decisions driven through pound here AIP. Game on.
