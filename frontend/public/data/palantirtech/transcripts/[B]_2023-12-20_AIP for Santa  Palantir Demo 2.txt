TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

At Palantir, we're always thinking about how our software can solve big operational challenges for our customers. Given the holiday season, we started to think about Santa. Just how does he manage it all? Imagine the colossal task of distributing gifts to billions of homes worldwide, each gift individually curated for a specific child, while determining who's been naughty and who's been nice. Over the past few months, we've run hundreds of AIP boot camps, which have all focused on using AI to tackle critical operational problems. We figured Santa himself might want to try out AIP. Here's a quick demo which I hopefully show the team up north what's possible. Welcome to Santa's Command Centre. All of the data in this demo is notional. At a high level, Santa has two tasks. Firstly, to find an optimal route through all of the countries where I need to live a presence on this trip. We've got a notional map here of recipients for this trip, which will be what are many trips for Santa on the night of Christmas Eve. We've also got some weather report data, as you can see they're all in different languages. Rather than spending hours to piece together all of this data to find a safe, yet optimal route, Santa could leverage the power of large language models using AIP logic. Here we have an AIP logic function. We give it a system prompt of your Santa's helper, your task is to help Santa deliver a Christmas presents to children across the world, so you must visit every country where you have children to deliver presents to. We give it access to your ontology through the query objects tool, specifically the country property of the recipient object, at a TypeScript function to calculate the optimal route given a list of countries. We say use a query tool to identify all the countries you'll need to visit, then use the optimal countries route tool to get an optimal route given a list of countries. We take the output of this as the optimal route. Then we have a second LLM function which uses the optimal route as an input, and this time we give it access to the weather report data, and we say look at this weather report data and decide whether it's safe for Santa to fly or not based on the weather conditions. Let's hit the run button. Getting back into the debugger view we can see exactly what the LLM is thinking. It starts off by grouping the recipients by country, and this gives it all the countries that it needs to visit, on this trip. And it says now that I have all the countries that's going to use the optimal countries route tool to find the optimal route, which starts at North Pole, goes to Finland, the UK, France, etc. Then we go into our second LLM block, where the LLM will use the ontology to get the weather report data for each country, and it does this by filtering down to each country, and it gets the weather report starting with Finland, it mentions cloudy skies, light snow for one reduced visibility. However, it doesn't seem extremely dangerous for Santa's sleigh, I'll keep Finland on the route and move to the next country, the UK. And it continues to do this for every country on the list. We scroll down, through to Greece. We see that Greece has some extreme tropical cyclones with strong rains, thunderstorms, and gale-force winds. Says this seems extremely dangerous for Santa's sleigh, I remove Greece from the route. Moves onto the next country, and if we scroll to the bottom, we can see the final route. Says Greece has been removed from the route due to tropical cyclone, hopefully on Santa's next trip around. The weather and Greece will clear up, don't worry kids, Santa will definitely get your presence. Finally, the only thing left for Santa to do is to load the sleigh with presents for this trip. Now we just have to pick the perfect present for each child on the route. This could take a while, we have to work out the age of each child, and then allocate the toys based on the recommended ages. Or we could use an AIP logic function. Here we have a prompt to help find the perfect present for each child. We give the LAM access to ontology, specifically the recipient objects, the date of birth, the first name, as well as the present subject. We also pass in the current date. We say to help Santa select the best present for each child, calculate the age for each child, and find the best present for them. Let's go ahead and hit the run. Within the debugger we can see exactly the steps that the LLAM will take. It says, first get the current date, then get the list of recipients, calculate the age of each child, get the list of presents, match the presents for each child based on their age. So it starts by using the tool to get the current date. It then goes to ontology and gets a list of recipients, and then it calculates their age using the current date. And finally goes back into ontology to get a list of presents. And then it matches the presents to each child. And we have an output at the bottom of a mapping that the elves can use to pack Santa sleigh. So there it is, Santa, if you think AIP can help you, you know where to find us. Happy holidays.
