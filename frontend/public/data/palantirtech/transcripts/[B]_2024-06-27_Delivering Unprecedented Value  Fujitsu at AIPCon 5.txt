TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi, nice to meet you. Good morning, everyone. My name is Kazuki Hisel from Fujitsu, working as a data scientist. So today, I'm really honored to be here with you to share how we collaborate with Planetier to deliver unprecedented body to our customers. So first of all, let's talk about Fujitsu and what we've done. Fujitsu is a site IT service provider, 9th largest in the world, and number one in Japan. And we've been a partner of Planetier since 2020 and actively using Planetier to transform our own business with 15,000 Foundry users and more than 100 Foundry engineers. And over the past three years, we've successfully connected over 85% of our systems and built more than 100 applications all by ourselves. So, given this extensive context and the experience to leverage Planetier Foundry so far, we are confident that we can deliver the great support to our customers to transform their business itself and the operations effectively and efficiently. So I would say, we are one of the biggest Foundry users and at the same time, we are leading implementation vendor in the world. Then next, let me introduce one of our initiatives with Planetier Foundry. So here's a use case from our hardware business. This is one of our Foundry use cases that we face many challenges, but a cheap great success. Over the past 40 years, more than 100 hydro systems and their data made it difficult to control and manage inventory control properly. Leading to leading to stagnant and excessive inventory as stockouts, they all negatively impact your own business for a long time. However, in our three months project, we've combined Foundry's data integration capabilities and Fujitsu's machine learning AI to transform our operations and many more efficient to create by creating a lot of systems and demand forecasting, invention, culture systems, and so on. This transformation resulted in an impressive annual cost reduction of nine million U.S. dollars within just three months. That was so impressive, wasn't it? Additionally, what's another amazing is, we've templated those kind of internal impressive use cases on Planetier. That means we can deliver the same business impact to our customers immediately with minimum workforce. So let me introduce two of our templates regarding supply chain management and one of them is inventory risk mitigation and the others disaster resilience. So here's the dashboard for stockout risk mitigation. Then top screen displays where alerts are occalling, Oculus Plants from the viewpoint of global business and what kind of alerts they are and their time series. Then today, let's focus on one of the product list item. On the scone screen, you can see inventory trend with several categories and get the specific date of shortage. So now, you realize you need to take action, for example, to reallocate inventory from other factories. Then this application gives you a great support to simulate inventory reallocation by adjusting those kind of conditions on the dashboard. And they are really customizable. It can be adaptable to your own business. Then if it's okay, you can send a notification or request to relevant stakeholders to get approval for this action. That's your novel view of our inventory risk mitigation. As you can see here, we not only integrate and visualize our supply chain data, but also help take action effectively. And we will start to launch those kind of templates to our customers for operational transformation for them. And next, this is for disaster resilience. As you probably know, Japan oftentimes face natural disasters, such as earthquake and tsunami and so on. So resilience is a vital for us deal with uncertainties. On this dashboard, the first of all, disaster information is automatically connected to a plant here from other sources. Then select disaster affected areas in Japan. And you can see on the map areas and suppliers, then select some suppliers that you want to focus on this time. Then you can understand fully potential impact throughout your entire supply chain. And if you need, you can get more detailed information at the planning level. So as a real world example, one of our customers reduced the amount of time for disaster resilience to one fifth from 10 days to two days. This impressive result highlights the extensive capabilities over our templates for supply chain management. So due to time constraints, I just showed two templates, but we have more over 30 or 35 templates regarding supply chain management and ESG and logistics. So if you are interested in those kind of applications, please let us know our keynote. Then as my final note, I'm really excited to strive for excellence, to create not only business impact, but also social impact through our partnership with PANTIR. That'll be all my presentation. Thank you.
