TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right, guys, good morning from blue to green from telecom to beer. So let's talk beer. It's a little bit early. But when I, my name is Lawrence Vanderroach, Chief Operations Officer, so when I entered the room this morning, I thought, wait a minute, it's only been six months since actually I was in the audience. And in those six months, actually, it feels much longer. But in the six months, I didn't know before coming here what Palantin was six months ago. So when they told me a week before, Ganesh invited me to join this AIP con in September 2024. Afterwards, we signed made an agreement. We did two proofs of concept. And guess what? We're presenting here now. So it could happen to you as well because Palantin is about speed. Moving on to what our proofs of concept. First of all, we did a commercial one. So we helped our team develop an application. What is the next best item to sell in 350,000 accounts? So we're not going to talk about that today. Maybe another time we're going to focus on supply chain because that's what I do. I have a team managing an international supply chain. So we produce Haydenken, those ekis, Takata, beautiful brands in Europe, Mexico, and some of actually in the US. We import 33,000 containers to nine demand points on nine warehouses across the country. We're shipping 6,000 trucks on an annual base to 450 customers. And those distributors ship it to the Wal-Mart's, the convenience stores, and the hotel, Mars and Reston. And our overall aim is to make sure that whenever you want to do this, that beautiful green bottle is there. That's it. Now, before we engage with Palantin here, we were already on a digital supply chain journey because, guess what, during COVID, many of you probably experienced that, it was a mess. We got breweries having to close, porch congested, trucks not showing up. But what we've been doing over the past three years is like, anything in supply chain, any disruption has a tendency to repeat itself. So why not solve the problem when we're in, but then find a way to connect data in such a way that you can detect that similar problem earlier, because if you detect the problem early, you don't go that deep in terms of mess. And secondly, the correction mechanisms, which are typically manual of speeding up or slowing down in terms of over supply, how can we automate that? So we have a whole suite in Power BI, connecting the brewery, the warehouses, all of our customer data. So we know exactly every day how much they have on inventory, how much they're selling. We started the track via ocean satellite tracking, the vessels to connect with the containers that are coming in, the big deal is there is to make sure that whatever is in our data, like a Hennington 12 pack, add a customer is something else. So how do you connect those? Because then the combination of data is not 1 plus 1 is 2, but 1 plus 1 is 5. Then we build some algorithms on top of it to be able to speed up or slow down. However, that came a little bit to an end because connecting all this data, we wanted to add retail stores, it became too much. So, and also the algorithms had to be started by humans, who don't run all the time. And you get like hundreds of follow-up actions, also my previous peer presented set up as well. You have to have the execution of capacity to implement all those changes. So on a personal, I love Formula One. So I always try to make a link with that, by the way the races are starting again this weekend. We had a great chassis of the car, but our engine was underpowered. So we went to Palantir because we wanted to have the best engine out there in order to make this nice combination of the chassis with the engine. Now, bear with me for the next slide because I think first of all we thought we got a great engine, which we did, but we also got a great team to work with. So, the Palantir engineers were super smart, great people to work with. We had also some good fun, so basically beer and tech. It's a great combo. Obviously, we were only drinking high and against zero while building. So it was like that. But the team really jelled well together. And that Tiger team actually in three months built what took us three years to build before. So that gives a little bit of the magnitude of speed. So, bear with me on this slide because actually this is the main message of my eight minutes. Fast forward your supply chain using AI to solve tomorrow's problems before they happen. Sounds odd, but actually that's what we do. Now, let me give you one example and then we go through some real live examples in the Foundry software. If you have a warehouse and you know for three weeks what orders are going to come out and you connect that with ocean freight data about what ship is coming in. Of course, you know how much you have on inventory. You can basically just like in a movie or Netflix. You can fast forward your supply chain three weeks because there's three weeks of outbound data, three weeks of inbound. So that means that you can see where the problems are going to happen. And in the supply chain there's always in balance. There's always a warehouse that has too much or too little of a product. But you can also do that customer level at port level at brewery level and we connected all of that. I'm going to show you three algorithms that we use. We have many more, but just to give you a flavor of it. It's going to be a little quick. So what you see here is let's say the background of people love maps or it is on the maps with all the stores are in there, warehouses are in there, you see the flows. We were focused basically on the west coast because we are here now. There's a potential future out of stock. So we have a new algorithm called a boo. I'll get to the name later, but I will actually look at if a customer has ordered the product. And for example, because we have a lead time of three weeks, which is normal in the beer business. It has a risk of running out of stock while we are still having to execute the order. A boo is saying you got to pick up that product in this case a Heineken 00 bottle six pack and automatically moved the delivery date earlier. So where a normal supply chains run five foe. So who places the order first and we execute in that particular order. Actually, this algorithm helps us to pull something ahead of the pack. So bypass a few others and make sure that actually the product is available at the same time. Because in the end, remember what I said when you want to do this, we need to have the we need to have the beer. So it's about deviation from a previous process. Let's move to a next one. Next example is about Dre. Dre is for those not involved in the maritime industry. Dre is actually getting a container from a port to a warehouse. Now, if a vessel arrives, the containers are always stored in this stack. The first few days are for free, but after a few days you start paying a lot of penalties. So the emergency attention is a big cost. So that we want to prevent. Typically, the general general processes, the container that has been hanging out in a port for a long time will be picked first. We have a new algorithm called Dr Dre and Dr Dre will pull it from. I mean, in this example, the Heineken 00, the amp store, if you were looking at it, the amp store was just arriving and we got a picket from the stack immediately. So again, an example of acceleration putting something ahead of the pack. Now, those two algorithms we were using before. However, with penalty, we can use them all the time. Not dependent on human intervention. Also, we can scale executing all those deviations. Now, the last example, because I think I'm running it a bit off the time, is smart shipping. So making beer will cost like three weeks. Let's take you three weeks to brew the beer, maybe one second to package it. And then we need three to eight weeks to get it here, depending where you are. New York is shorter. She had a little bit longer to get that. Now, what we do is we brew and produce on forecast. However, by the time that all the resources are arranged, materials, people, etc. And you're about to fill the bottle or the can. Things will have changed. So all of these imbalances can have moved. So we together with pelant here, we develop an algorithm that can take two days before the container is being loaded, take whatever is produced, take an existing booking and swap what goes where. So an example that was in the background, we needed a Heineken 12 back was planned to go to Houston. That cargo we're going to put in a container going to Seattle. Because again, we see in the future where the problems are going to happen. Now, you had me talk about our boo, Dr. Dre Neptune. Those are creative names. And it's very important because the users came up with us. Because I want to make sure that whoever uses AI or algorithms owns the algorithm and doesn't see it as a threat. So now in our DCS, our daily control system, we talk about Dr. Dre said this and he's doing that. And he said, you're adding a person to your team, a sidekick to the people and empower them. Secondly, I think it also has changed, has to be leader led. So for me as head of operations, I'm probably one of the biggest users of our command center algorithms, etc. Because if I adopt the chains, I know my team will. And secondly, reward and recognition is super important. We have inside the Heineken group, we're one of the best supply chains or many dimensions. Also our customers are sharing with us that our availability for the last two years is better than most even domestic producers, which is something we would have never ever imagined. So what's next? We're going to, we showed the peak sneak peak under the hood that everything is in foundry and all the algorithms and are moving and doing things in order to actually speed up or slow down. We're going to a second stint with with balance here where we're going to move all of this into production. So far we're a proof of concepts, we're moving in production and actually drive the benefit in the year where we actually implemented. So that's all next and let me end by saying I think Frank and I are head of digital. We're here, we'd love to talk to you, we'd like you to challenge us because we want to be the best and then we should be open to sharing what we have and make it better together with you. And last but not least, my final note is fast forward your supply chain using II to solve tomorrow's problems before they happen. Thank you very much.
