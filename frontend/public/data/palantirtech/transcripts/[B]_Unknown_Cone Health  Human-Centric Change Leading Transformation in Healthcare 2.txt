TRANSCRIPT

I'm Mandy Eaton and I'm the Chief Operating Officer for Cone Health. We are a $2.7 million health system located in Greensboro, North Carolina. And my talk today is about human-centric elements of change. So over the last three years, the pandemic brought us all to our needs. We've all been impacted by it and it's hit especially hard in the healthcare industry. It accelerated many of the challenges we were already confronting pre-pandemic, things like staffing shortages, financial performance, burnout, and fatigue. It exacerbated these issues and here we are today looking for ways to get back on our feet and care for our entire workforce and transform ourselves as an industry. It's no small task. We have a fatigue workforce and it's at a crisis state from a public health perspective. That's a real problem for healthcare because everything in our industry starts with our people. Our people are the reason we're able to deliver safe, high-quality healthcare to the communities that were privileged to serve. We've come to realization that in healthcare, the war for talent is over and talent has won. The shortages in our workforce are unprecedented. The US has projected to face a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034 and the World Health Organization estimates a short fall of 10 million healthcare workers globally by 2030. These numbers are staggering and we cannot, we will not be able to recruit our way out of this position. So we're tasked with thinking differently about how we get work done in our hospitals and our clinics, particularly when healthcare is largely task-centric and it's focused on people. One way we've decided to do that is to advance our technology and our use of technology, specifically, genitive AI tools to ease the burden of our caregivers at the bedside. At Cone Health, we have four strategic priorities and one of them is to create a future-ready workplace and in doing so, we believe we can bring joy and purpose back to a fatigue workforce. So the question we're confronted with is how can technology help solve for the emotional, physical and safety impact of a fatigue healthcare workforce and importantly, how can we manage that change? The obvious answer is change management. However, generative AI is new to us so we quickly realized that our work with Palantir wouldn't be any ordinary change initiative. You can think about change and change is made in an organization on a spectrum. Some change initiatives are small and some are large and there's a lot in between. So for purposes of level setting, I'm going to discuss three common types, starting with developmental change. I'm the low impact side of the spectrum. These are often seen in small, incremental steps to improve on something that already exists. Might be a modification of an existing policy or an improvement to sales or quality goals. Developmental changes are small. They're incremental. They're relatively easy to do and they do have some impact on the workforce. Then there is transitional change, which is sort of the middle of the spectrum and it's likely to create a new state out of an old problem. So transitional change is a bit heavier and it's scaled a bit larger than developmental change. This might be a change to your organizational structure or replacing an old product or service. And then on the far end of the spectrum, there's transformational change. The kind of change where you're building something and you don't know exactly what it looks like. Leading through a pandemic, for example, that was a transformational change for many of us. We didn't exactly know what the outcome was going to be. It was highly unpredictable. And there was very little, if any, precedent for how we managed a novel virus in the past. A transformational change is one that involves the significant strategic and cultural reform typically for your organization. And there's obviously a lot of stakes. So when we chose to strategically invest in a future ready workplace, we knew that what we were going to have to do is something that was going to radically alter the way work occurs for our workforce. And that's why we chose to partner with Palantir. So as we progress through this discussion, I'll ask you to set your minds on a transformational change that's taking place in your organization because as we go through this discussion, the ideas I'll share with you are meant to really address the change management required for something that's transformational, something that has strategic and cultural implications for your organization. Okay, so we're all thinking about change management of something that's transformational for our organizations. Now the good news is there are probably a dozen change management models out there. A handful of really good ones are listed here on this slide. And it's good to know that there's some very smart scholars out there who have dedicated their lives to providing people like us, the models that we need to help drive change. And they're all great. Really, you can't go wrong with any of them. But when we're talking about a transformational change, none of these tools alone are enough. I'll offer for your consideration that when it comes to transformation, organizations don't transform. Leaders do. I say this because there's a lot of research out there that packs the statement up. What countless studies have shown is that their track record for change at most organizations is not very good. The vast majority fail to produce their intended results. And the impact of a failed change of work can be material and can have effects on our budgets, our time, our people, our customers, and even faith in our leadership. The Harvard Business Review, for example, published a study of 3,000 executives evaluating their success and then enterprise transformation efforts. According to these executives, more than 70% of their transformation efforts failed. What the study revealed was that the failure rate is so high because we misunderstand this very fact. Organizations don't transform. Leaders do. So we are spending a lot of time and money on change efforts and yet not obtaining their intended return on investment. Put another way, organizational leadership is falling short in their efforts to lead change successfully. And the pattern is clear. Dilligent leaders often devote countless resources to planning out the perfect change management initiative. The problem is that most of the time they're viewing transformation through old mindsets and applying traditional management approaches, traditional ways of thinking and behaving. The thing about transformational change is that it's not business as usual. Unfortunately too many leaders want transformation to happen on realistic speeds with minimal effort and everywhere but within themselves. To raise the odds of success, I suggest the place that leaders need to begin their transformation efforts is not their organizations. It's themselves. This is the distinction between being and doing in leadership. It's not the systems and structures that drive agility in an organization. Models and infrastructure systems and plans, they're all important. But agility is driven when leaders spend time helping people accept change. This is the being part of leadership and it includes elements like being self-aware, authenticity, developing trust and demonstrating resilience and it starts with knowing that it's our job to see the world as it's going to be and not as it has been. So I'll share a story of when we brought in an external consultant about a decade ago to help us intentionally shift our organizational culture. We were all together as a leadership team listening to the results of our first ever culture assessment and our chief hater officer at the time raises hand and he said, wow, I'm sitting here listening to these results and I'm thinking, gosh, somebody should do something about this. He paused and said, then I realized that that somebody is me. It was a powerful moment and when we still talk about today, he was so self-aware, he realized that if we were going to materially shift the culture of our organization, it was going to take not just him, but all of us recognizing that something within us must also change. The story highlights the simple truth that if you want transformation in your organization, it's not the role of leadership to protect what we've got. It's the role of leadership to create what's possible. So there are really three pillars to effectively leading transformation, framing context setting and communication, overcoming stakeholder resistance and the personal transformation of yourself as a leader. So let's start with framing setting context and communication. The impact of transformational change typically is going to be seen and felt by a large portion if not all of your organization. In our case, our work with Palantir involves building under staffing model with generative AI that will impact how all of our nurses and their leaders manage their work schedules and staffing other units. We have a small pilot underway now and we have plans for all five of our hospitals to roll out this change in the coming weeks. So the first thing we've done is talk about this solution with our teams in the context of what's possible and to frame this conversation in the realm of what's possible, we use language that inspired people to think about this change as something that's big and bold, not just something that's going to incrementally improve their experience. So we spend a lot of time setting context about our work with Palantir and how it's our first organizational initiative in the realm of generative AI and that they're the pioneers at the forefront of this change. A big takeaway here is that the amount of time we spent in conversation had to increase dramatically. So much so that by the time we were done talking about this transformation, we were so tired of talking about this transformation. Also, we had to recognize that in order for our teams to dedicate their time and energy to this work capacity has to get created actively. And unfortunately, none of us will wake up tomorrow with nothing to do. So leaders have to declare, okay, these are the five things that don't get to happen as a result of this transformation. The organization has to have capacity to actually carry out and succeed in a change. And this gesture of freeing time for people to focus is one that conveys a tremendous amount of respect for those that are being impacted by the change. So framing and setting context and communication are foundational steps. And when they're done really well, they build the progression of a community that's more willing to join your transformation. Overcoming stakeholder resistance is the next step. This is a tough one because anxiety is the fastest spreading cultural effect in any organization. People resist change for reasons they don't have works for. Our brains are wired back to our days, this cavemen and women, to avoid anything that has changed, to keep us safe and to steer us away from unfamiliar. The amygdala in our brains actually interprets change as a threat and it emits a flight or flight signal intended to keep us safe. So resistance to change is a physical thing. There's a story about a car company who had to eliminate several hundred jobs and they offered all of their impacted employees the opportunity to get retrained to do a different job within the company and lieu of being laid off. What was fascinating was that only 5% of the impacted employees actually took the company up on the opportunity for retraining to do something else. When they dug into this and they tried to understand the why behind this phenomenon, they learned that these employees would rather try to find similar work elsewhere instead of having to be an amateur at work again. They were afraid of being new at something and their fear of being the novice again made people look for work that they already knew how to do elsewhere. People resist change for reasons they don't have works for. So when it comes to overcoming stakeholder resistance, the big takeaway here is that resistance to transformational change should be expected and it's not always going to be rational. You should give serious thought to a tactic called a stakeholder analysis which is where you catalog the known hot spots in your organization and intentionally think through what's important to that stakeholder group and then develop a plan to address their unique concerns head on. The commitment curve you see here is a good way to understand the stages people go through when they learn of a change that's going to impact them. So if we are wildly successful in framing and setting context and communication and overcoming stakeholder resistance, we can bring people over time from a basic level of awareness of the change through the commitment curve to adoption and even to ownership. So those are just some of the tactical tips about the change process and how as a leader you can help others navigate a transformational change. Now let's spend just a minute talking about what it takes for you yourself to lead a transformational change. First, ask yourself, who am I being as a leader and am I spending my time protecting what I've got or am I focused on creating what's possible. Second, ask yourself, where is my energy going? Typically when we're leading a change, we spend 90% of our time on the plan, the documents and the spreadsheets, the preparation, all that stuff and we only spend 10% of our time getting people to embrace it change. It really needs to be the other way around. We must drastically increase the amount of time we spend face-to-face in conversation and I really cannot emphasize that point enough. And then finally, how do I actively create capacity? It's up to us as leaders to ensure that efforts are prioritized and paid to ensure that the organization has capacity to actually carry them out and succeed. So in closing, I think we're all here today because our organizations are up to big things and as leaders, we don't have to continue to fall short in our change management efforts and we don't have to accept mediocre results, but we do have to be willing to ask ourselves the very hard truth about how we show up as leaders and ultimately we have to confront our own willingness to let go of what we've got in order to see what's possible and then lead others to see that very same possibility. Thank you.
