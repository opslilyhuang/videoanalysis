TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right Kelly thank you very much. All right welcome back to the milk and global conference here in Beverly Hills. We got a big crowd behind us here. Now share's a Palantir down today. They had their earnings last night. Most people said the earnings were good. So what exactly is going on? We'll talk about that but the real news is this. There is a big deal that is being made in AI today between Elon Musk, XAI, TWG group, which is Thomas Tull, Mark Walter, investment group, and also the aforementioned Palantir. And we're joined now by Thomas Tull and the CEO of Palantir Alex Carp in a power lunch, exclusive guys. Thanks for patience. Appreciate you being on. Why do this deal with TWG, XAI? What does Palantir get out of this? Well first of all Thomas is a legend in the investing community and almost all the successful defense startups have been financed by him and says a reputation second to none. And I know his work and his reputation in the defense tech startup. And he's a world which we know very well and without him many of the great startups that come after Palantir would not exist. The mission of Palantir is to give an unfair advantage to our friends. And if you look at what's regional banks have been saddled with regulatory hurdles and deep technical issues, almost all of which can be solved by the combination of his insights into banking, which is one of the most successful people in the world at. Their tech infrastructure and large language models and compute. And that combination will bring the unit economics of a company like Palantir to regional banks and allow them to do what big banks are claiming to do and grow the revenue at much lower cost. Those are very nice Thomas. I mean very complimentary but here's the sad reality of AI. Every company wants to say, I've joked Alex, we're going to change her name to CNBC AI because you get like a valuation pop. AI is really good at taking money. It's not been very good at making money. I think that's exactly right. You get pitched things like that all the time. In our case, we hired Drew Kukor who's a very well-known practitioner in artificial intelligence, built JP Morgan systems and built out our team. And before we put this together, we use it at Guggenheim. We use our platform on all our systems and it's made an impact, a material impact. And everything we talk about is, if you made a dollar before, are you now making more than a dollar or are you just talking about it? So that's what we're... People are just talking about it. And this is a thing. You've got to judge a company or an institution by the food they bear. And the thing at Palantir is we're quite good at making money. So we're highly profitable. There's a rule of financial hygiene called a rule of 40. I think the highest ever recorded or one of the highest ever recorded 83. We make money by being downstream of value creation. At Palantir and with our partners, we own value and we take a part of that value and get paid on it. So we're not going to be making any big money unless the people we work with make even more money. And one of the problems of the AI revolution is it's a tale of two cities. It's a tale of people who take your money and give you flowery language in the past. It was woke. Now it's like you get to feel good about something as hot chute or you can partner and we partner together in his bank. So you can already see the value creation and we see this across every industry where the unit economics change. Which is why Palantir is growing 71% in the US. We're going to get to that in a second, but I think I would say this. It's fair to say that AI, Thomas, is like the seed. We're planting a seed and hoping it grows into a tree. With this deal, you're kind of already buying the tree in a way. Palantir's built out. X AI. They've got the infrastructure sort of built out. That giant processing center in Memphis, Tennessee. Lots of land, lots of fresh water, by the way. Lots of electricity and stuff it takes. How quickly does this put you sort of quote in the game to sell money making AI to Wall Street and insurance companies and more? Right now. Because again, we have been doing this, you know, Mark built an incredible financial empire. Mark Walton. Mark, my partner, Mark Walton, 30 years of doing this has an incredible deep knowledge set around finance, structure, etc. We know that world deeply and we know what's possible now because we've done it. So we're not asking others to do anything that we haven't done ourselves. So by this year, we'll be out with major customers across banking, insurance, money management. And I think by having Palantir, their tools set. Already have customers interested. We absolutely do. Yes. Already. Already. And you just announced it this morning. Yeah, we've, I mean, we've been working on this for a while. You better have some substance by the time you announce this. We're very excited about it. And with X AI, not only do you have their models, but as you mentioned, their compute is unparalleled. You know, by the way, like, please, it's not just making money. It's making money with less money invested. And what makes AI very special is not just that you grow the revenue in partnership, but the cost of getting the revenue should go down radically. And this again is particularly important for smaller institutions. Because in the past, the way you would do this is by investing billions and billions of dollars into complexity. And the smaller institutions could not weave their way through that complexity. But what we can do to use your metaphor is supply the pre-built tree of your knowledge, X AI models and our software infrastructure. And that pre-built tree lowers the cost of revenue and allows you to increase the amount of revenue you can take. Because you know what I'm talking about, okay? When we talk about, you know, let's go back to what they call greenwashing, right? Every company was climate friendly, right? We make bleach and now we're climate, we make chemicals that were climate friendly. There was a lot of every company wanted you to say they were green, they were whatever. There's a lot of that going on in AI right now. Alex, you know that, right? Companies like, oh, we used to do this, but now we're AI and everything's great. How much of it is just BS? I was going to say something else. You've got to judge the products by what they bear. So again, is the cost of revenue less? Is the revenue going up? Are you out able to deal with complexities you couldn't, like regulatory complexities? Are you able to impose unique business strategies onto your business? And those businesses are going to flourish. And yes, there's a lot of BS, but you can really, really see it in numbers. One of the things, by the way, I would say that's very contradictory is the people who are most interested in making money are going to gravitate to the things that actually work. And it's very similar to the battlefield. There's not BS on the battlefield. And if you're going to partner with Thomas and his partners, you have to deliver real financial results. Or they're not interested. Because you're not doing magic. This is about success. You better have metrics to weigh and measure everything you're doing and to be hyper honest about the results. That's it. And look, I believe artificial intelligence is ultimately going to have an unbelievable impact on almost every aspect of life, but it's early. And it's not magic. It's going to take time to develop, develop use cases, find out what works. And that's what we're diving into. Bill, you're an hedge fund manager, Paul Tudor Jones, who you probably know said on CBC this morning that AI was going to kill half the human population or something like that. It's an existential threat to humanity. Sounds like you would disagree with that. I'd have to have the context. He's obviously a very smart guy. But I do know this. We have adversaries on this planet that are pouring everything into artificial intelligence, quantum computing, space. And if the United States is not willing to compete and go all in, I think we're going to have very big problems. One to just tie these, the biggest danger to your company or to our country is not being able to know what to invest in and what's BS. The stuff you can invest in on the battlefield all over the world has already changed the course of history. And right next to it are a bunch of complete BS products where the unit economics are completely failful. Like what? Give me an example. I mean, look, I'm not. It's garbage. I'm, we're focused on making our business great, but every business is going to have to reach out. And one of the things that makes Thomas so special here is you can't expect everyone to have the taste to pick out the thing that's BS or the thing that's not. Thomas went and found the world's leader in battle field operational AI and hired him. So you don't have to trust your taste on AI. You can trust his. You don't have to trust your taste in what's going to be in a price. You can go look at his. By the way, every government in the world is doing this. They're looking at what works and what doesn't. He told me yesterday that Palantir was pretty good at this. Those people in the world who are making money by lowering their unit economics and growing their revenue and or alive on the battlefield have a partnership that looks a little bit like the three of us. Very quick. I want to ask about Aaron Rogers, but it's Steelers, but I know he's going to walk off very quickly. Your numbers look, I got to ask you this, stocks down today, you printed money. You made a lot of people millionaires, a lot of our viewers and listeners hopefully very rich. What's the market getting wrong about today? Hey, if you don't like 71% growth in US, come 45% growth in USG, a rule of 83, 55% growth in 90% of our business, in the 55% growth in the US, 49% growth in 90% of our business. You don't like that. Go look for something else. We're pretty happy. You don't have to buy our shares. We're happy. We're going to partner with the world's best people and we're going to dominate. And you can be along for the ride or you don't have to be. Are we going to see Aaron Rogers and a Steelers uniform this year? I'm here to talk about AI and that's a more complex issue than artificial intelligence. I don't know if that's an existential threat, but we'll get it. We won't get into it. Don't worry. Thank you. I've got a panel later with Peyton Manning, maybe I'll ask him. He's a good man. Thomas Tall, Alex Carp, great conversation, big deal, TWG, Palantir, XAI, change in financial services and insurance and it's not BS. But Kelly, I am BS and I'm going to send it back to you.
