TRANSCRIPT

Hey guys, good afternoon. Hard to top this shall be, but I'll do my best. Three things before I get started. One, I joined City Wealth about nine months ago. Two, I came here to revolutionize and disrupt wealth management as we know it. If you are one of my competitors, you should fear us because I am about to crush you. Full stop. Okay. So first let me tell you a little bit about City. In terms of the brand, how long we've been around. It's been a couple of hundred years of this business. We are super global. We're in over a hundred different countries. We serve as some of the world's change makers. I'll call them the billionaires of the world that have families in different jurisdictions, investments all over the place, and run businesses and companies across the globe. We also have over a million clients, a million dollar households all over the world as well. We move money around the planet, five trillion dollars a day, equal to sort of Germany's GDP. But the reality is, is it super fragmented or systems are archaic, slow. And obviously this story is less about sort of analytics and anomaly detection. It's more about what I'll call intelligent automation, optimization and synchronization at scale. You're a client of ours. Your DNA sits in like 55 to 100 different systems. So your first name, your last name, your birthday. Investment objectives, risk tolerance, you name it. Is all fragmented. Invest, guess what? If you make an address change, like literally log online, it goes to a human who has to log into 55 systems to update it. That's not going to work. Okay? But income's palantir. And I only work with cutting-edge partners. And I'm as arrogant as some of the Palantir folks were, day one. To be honest with you, they said, listen, we're going to tell you things that you don't want to hear similar to what Alex said in the beginning. And if you don't want to work with us, we're not the right partner. I said, game on, let's go. So anyway, let me get to the reality of what's going on here. So less about slides, more demo than anything else. So effectively, we're starting with all of our reference data. So think about client data, securities in our world. So think of Apple technology. It's in this sector industry. We have real-time prices, corporate action, stock splits, and all that fun stuff. We're putting all that into the DNA of Foundry and our ontology. What you see in front of you is a bit of a cockpit. So I can see real-time as customers open up accounts as new securities come in the market. Or an event like a stock split is taking place. But really, let me dig into all the stuff that's happening. So what you see here as well is a bit of how many accounts are getting opened on the fly, people making deposited deposits, moving money. At the lower right-hand corner, you see us bringing together that client DNA in a single place. My team alone is probably in 14 countries. So it's even getting them to synchronize and align to do analytics and cool things like AI. It's a bit tough. I'm going to click into the experience now around opening an account. What you'll see on the page is a bunch of things happening. So when you log into a system and you sort of put in all of your information, effectively what's happening is a bunch of signals are taking place. And we're automating each and every process of the account opening life cycle. But today, that's manual humans going in to system by system by system. I'll show you a deeper example in a second. Imagine you're that client and you come online, you upload your passport, you fill out like the seven questions, it comes to a person. Well, behind the scenes, you know, a couple things. One, we have to validate your address to make sure it's a legal address. And in the US, we might have to send it to a database. Palantir is actually shooting and streaming events real time. And then coming back and saying yes, it's also streaming events to our KYC systems to make sure this isn't like a terrorist known location or something or other. It's also then invoking potentially a docuSign to actually send out to the client systematically. So when the client signals back, it comes back. And it's lifting the data off the passport in 100 different countries all across the globe. So this sort of process would take like nine days. Now it takes like seconds. So it's pretty instantaneous. And that's just one example. Let me show you a little bit more. I'm now going to show you sort of the end to end process going across the top. What you'll see is a bunch of activities. So you see one through eight. And what you see going down in the bottom is all these sort of services that I just mentioned. So within each of the activities, there could be over 100 processes across 19 different systems. So the green checks means, hey, it's processing real time. And any time there's sort of an issue, maybe the passport didn't get read correctly. Or maybe the person's waiting on, you know, clicking on the docuSign. We're sort of getting alerted and ultimately until when it's complete. What's really cool here though is this is the first time ever, like, anyone's even seen the end to end process. It took Palantir to come in to actually the two people that's next to each other didn't even realize, like, oh wow, I didn't know that if you put this extra data upstream or you had the strap down, it impacted me. So now we can see side by side all of the processes. And effectively, we took out, you know, nine days into minutes and, you know, 50 people sometimes until like one single person. We've replaced pretty much all the makers. We still have some checkers. But this automation at scale, we're looking at every single workflow possible. And this allows us to build even new sort of capabilities and new online services. What you see here, we call it the GFCM. It's our global federated client master. So think of that as my DNA. All the things I just said, first name, last name, birthday, investment objectives, risk tolerance. We're deeply integrated into all of our systems. Think of this like iCloud with your iPhones, the easiest analogy, right? So you log in, you have your iPhone, you have an iPad, you have a MacBook, you have a long vacation, and maybe you log into some third party, you know, iCloud, you make a one change. This thing synchronizes it all. And guess what? Some of these old school systems. It's like, hey, this many characters that only can handle blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, Palantir orchestrates that entire synchronization process, which is pretty slick. So for us, like, you know, having people go through system by system is, you know, gone and those days are over. And as of, you know, Palantir synchronizing it is the cool thing here. Let me show you a little bit more about how we bring this data together in depth. Because it's pretty complicated, given that we're in 100 countries. And if you're that family that has global DNA, and your kids have an account with us in the US, and you have a family office in Singapore, we're bringing it together. What's really cool on the right hand side is the power that I can now bring. So if you think about a financial advisor who has a thousand clients, how do I know that you have Facebook that's downgraded, a bombaturing CD come and do it, your birthday, and guess what you live in California? Or maybe there's a wildfire going on? Well, I can actually stream all these events and prioritize and rank every single one. And effectively, to the financial advisor, say, here's who you should talk to, and here's what you should talk to them about today. And oh, by the way, we're invoking AI models to write messages in elementary school, middle school, and high school versions. And depending how you respond in different languages, I can actually track and trace. So when you watch Netflix and you watch Rocky, it's 1980, Sylvester Stallone action. It learns. And maybe it's Rocky too, or maybe it's Rambo, maybe not. But effectively, I know what to serve you up less and what not to serve you. So over on the right, you'll see a bunch of next best actions for an individual client as an example. These processes, to be honest with you, have allowed us to decrease like speed to market by at least 90%. When it comes to sort of onboarding accounts doing KYC checks, bringing new securities into the marketplace, it's reduced massive friction in the system and the ecosystem there. I'm taking us from defense and broken band-aids bubble gum and duct tape to offense. And how do we use this data to inform our advisors and make them go faster? It's like Superman or Superman, I'm just giving them a cape to actually know what to talk to their clients about. So like I said, and like Alex said, I came to dominate, crush, and annihilate. So if you're JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, sorry. All's done.
