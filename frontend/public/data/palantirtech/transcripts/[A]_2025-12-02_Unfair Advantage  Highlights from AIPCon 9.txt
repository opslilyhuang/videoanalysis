TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

If you compare corporate culture in America to any other country, you have highly dynamic meritatic structures that are plastic in the sense that people will move and change to what works, not what worked yesterday, and is actually a place where people still believe in basic controversial concepts like meritocracy, agency. Today we're recognizing that you can be humble and you can still be the best. The volunteer helps main health win more with less. So we set out to partner with Palantir to completely redesign this workflow and rethink the way that we do business. We've been working with Palantir for over 10 years, year on year. We're getting triple figure investment from the investments that we've made in Palantir without failing. They were our choice for bringing the power of AI into the fight against insurance company denials. Foundry allows us to focus on what matters, keeping our plans running smoothly and delivering the highest quality product for our customer. Currently it takes us about 12 years on average and $3 billion to develop a novel medicine. So this is not a problem we can solve with vibe coding alone. This worker first mentality, my client is the front line employee. We're not taking our front line clinicians or doctors or nurses out of the loop. We're actually elevating and augmenting them to do what's necessary that humans should deal with humans. Leveraging the ontology and AIP. Data 42 has been able to combine tens of billions of rows of data from over 700 million patient lives from real-world data as well as from our 3000 clinical trials and compassing about a million patients. So far scientists and for me honestly it's not the goal to go home 30 minutes earlier to walk my dog. This flight event that came through the area was truly, truly off the records and I knew that there was one answer to that question. We needed assistance from Palantir to build a common operating picture that we would use to drive future operations. From Curvell and the citizens of Kerr County, citizens of Texas, from the unified command, from the search efforts that have been out there at the local state and the national level as well as the international searches that have come into help us. Thank you for giving us the unfair advantage as we continue this Herculane Task of finding our last two victims.
