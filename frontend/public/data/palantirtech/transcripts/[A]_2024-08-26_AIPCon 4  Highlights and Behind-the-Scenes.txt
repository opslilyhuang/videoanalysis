TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

This is our fourth AIP con inside of 12 months. We have more than 70 customers speaking on this stage and we're so excited to be here to share that community with you. We launched AIP just over a year ago. Our central thesis around what would make AI valuable was really taken from a lot of our insights on the battlefield. The best innovation comes from those people that are working on the front line. Here's this is Gartner, 89% of these analytic programs tend to fail to execute. On the technology side, we were looking for a partner and an approach to our data strategy if you will excuse the term that actually produced shit. We chose Palantir because their products are absolutely best in the class. By leveraging this technology, we're sending people home to their families where otherwise they might have had a different outcome. So far we've saved over 100,000 customers from delays and cancellations. We've successfully connected over 85% of our systems and built more than 100 applications all by ourselves. We have seen the 60 million US dollar improvement in profit and we expect an additional 100 million US dollar over the next three years. Because there's an awful profit organization, every dollar counts. We are Palantir's house band, the Seeing Stone.
