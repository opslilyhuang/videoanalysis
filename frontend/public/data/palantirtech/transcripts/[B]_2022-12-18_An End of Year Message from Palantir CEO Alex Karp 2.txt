Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, joyous holidays, whatever holiday you're celebrating. We're celebrating with you. This has been a long year where we've seen war recession, inflation, tech under attack. We've also seen building products that are, can change the course of history in the context of war, supplying our allies with the sharpest weapons can make the world a safer and better place. Supplying industry with transformational, decisioning platforms can make industry exceedingly valuable, robust, successful. We've seen great success in the U.S. of A and in allied countries. We're very proud of that. We're proud to have your support. We're proud that you've gone with us through good and bad. We're proud that you've watched with supporting eyes as we've delivered coal to our adversaries and valuable assets to our friends. We hope you continue on our journey next year with us and we're looking forward to being with you then. All the best. Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas.
