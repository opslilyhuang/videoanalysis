================================================================================

From everyone at Palantir I want to wish you a joyous holiday season, a Merry Christmas, a happy new year. Whatever you're celebrating, I hope you celebrate. It's been a long year for many people with a lot of suffering. But at the end of the year we can all think about what we're grateful for. And we at Palantir are grateful that we've been able to play our role in helping emulate some of the greatest difficulties of the last century, including our efforts to disseminate the vaccine, PPE globally, the lives that were saved with the help of our government partners. Also helping to revitalize commercial companies all over the globe. Our ability to help startups transform themselves before they're crushed by the status quo. And in general, the fact that Palantir, although we're two decades old, seems to me to be getting younger and younger faster and faster. Our product development is faster. Our ability to move across jurisdictions, our ability to provide value. Palantir is a company that looks for the most complicated problems and solves them. Palantir and Anne's not an or company, civil liberties and data protection, enterprise becoming more valuable and more efficient. Vaccines distributed and data protected. Interesting about this last year is that about 30% of our products have become unintelligible to the general public so that people understand that you need a pound like product or boundary to make your ML, your AI, and generally to deliver value. People understand or starting to understand that the software they've been purchasing is a trinket that turns them into a product much like consumer internet turned individuals into products. People are starting to understand that the enterprise is a software production entity and that you must master the development or integration of software. People are beginning to understand the value of our products. On the other hand, we have many, many products that are going to come online that are way outside the knowledge horizon of what we're doing, such as building AI at the edge, building AI off the larger and even larger everyday data sets and many more things. Working in a geopolitical context where things become to couple, your software is made to work in the only fully integrated environment. These are things that we've been working on for decades. We're delivering fashion ever and we're grateful for our role to be able to provide these products. So, until next year, or hopefully I'll talk to you before I want to wish you again, happy holidays from all of us as a pound here and take care.
