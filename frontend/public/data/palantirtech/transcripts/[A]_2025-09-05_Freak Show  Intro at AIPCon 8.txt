TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We were the freak show. I've been cautioned to be a little modest about our bombastic numbers. Extraordinary numbers. We still believe America is the leader of the free world, that the West is superior, that we have to fight for these values. We should give American corporations, and most importantly our government, an unfair advantage. The single biggest thing that will make this country dominant is to make industry in this country look like venture did and give venture returns to growth. The most unique thing that Palette here does is we own value creation. We spent 20 years for this moment. Palette here is here to disrupt and make the institution we partner with the very best in the world. And when it's necessary to scare enemies and want to keep you from killing them.
