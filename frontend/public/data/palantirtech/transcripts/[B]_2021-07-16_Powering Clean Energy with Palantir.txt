At Palantir, we don't shy away from a challenge. Consumers are demanding smarter, cleaner energy. To make the transition real, companies must rapidly digitize and use their data intelligently. Palantir partners with energy suppliers to support ambitious clean energy targets. Our clients use our platform to minimize downtime, optimize maintenance, and manage intermittency. In Foundry, our clients build digital twins of renewable assets. Once optimized digitally, they can steer assets in reality, generating more power. Today, we help our customers deliver clean, affordable electricity. Palantir proudly empowers energy companies and utilities to meet their most complex challenges.
