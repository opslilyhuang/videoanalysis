Good morning. Chris Johnson at TeleTracking Technology, CEO. Today I'm excited to announce our strategic partnership with Palantir, the Transform Healthcare Operations. Founded in 1991, TeleTracking is a healthcare technology company that works with over 150 health systems globally. For our three decades, we defined what would become an industry, patient flow and capacity management software. Our logistics platform, Operations IQ, helps hospitals and health systems expand their capacity to care. By improving patient flow, optimizing capacity, automating workflows, and delivering real time data-driven insights. In a complex system like healthcare, every second counts. Small improvements in visibility, automation, and coordination can drive a massive impact. Changing how and where patients receive their care. Our mission has always been clear. To bend the cost curve of healthcare down while improving access and quality of care. Together with Palantir, we are addressing the deep rooted inefficiencies of an $8 trillion industry that touches every human being on the planet. These are the policies that we can help reduce by targeting approximately $275 billion in global healthcare waste. At 20% of the total GDP of the United States being spent on healthcare, it is simply unsustainable. We are solving for a macroeconomic problem that Warren Buffett famously said was a tapeworm on the U.S. economy. By combining teletracking domain expertise and unique operational data with Palantir's AI and analytics power, we are entering a new era. One where hospitals and health systems can make informed AI-enabled decisions, delivering quality and better care at better margins. But this partnership isn't just about technology. It's about two industry first, with a shared mission to reimagine healthcare and to drive positive change in the world. So with that said, I'm excited to walk you through some of the new capabilities that we're building on our operations IQ platform. This is a capability on operations IQ reimagined with Palantir. Together we're changing how patients access care, how clinicians work, how actionable intelligence becomes a true catalyst in driving healthcare forward. We've all experienced long wait times, long periods of unknowns about diagnosis or treatment and the uncertainty of navigating an incredibly complex system. But there's growing momentum to make healthcare more accessible, transparent, patient-centered. Now it's possible, and quite frankly it's human, to feel frustration with that complex system, but still hold a deep admiration for the people within it. Those healthcare just isn't a system. It is people, it is a calling, it's moments, and it's personal. So imagine this, a patient in a lower acuity facility needs a hospital transfer. We'll call him David. He needs a specialty bed and equipment. And his condition requires a telecitor monitoring upon arrival. The process starts the way it still does too often today, as we work around the world. A fact sheet, yes, still a fax, sent to a transfer center followed by a phone call. From there a human agent manually extracts patient details, identifies clinical needs, hunts for a hospital bed and equipment, an available physician willing and able to accept the patient. It's slow, it's manual, and it happens 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Now imagine that process for hundreds of patients across dozens of facilities. What you're looking at beside me is a better way. It's enabled by technology, informed by clinicians, and powered by actionable intelligence. With the new capability and operations IQ, the same fact sheet is received. But now within seconds actionable intelligence extracts the critical and logistical details. Detailed eyes needs, telecitor requirements, diagnoses, comorbidities. Details often are sometimes overlooked, but critical to ensure a patient gets the right care at the first time. Within tele tracking, beds are automatically identified that match the patient's need. Checks for the availability of the equipment and begins assembling all of the moving parts required for that transfer. No manual entering, entry, no back and forth phone calls, no delays from missed details or resource mismatches. This is the future of real-time frictionless patient care. A hospital or health system where staff are empowered and most importantly, patients get the right care faster. So here's something else that we put in new, and we're especially excited about. The system doesn't just suggest the next steps. It takes them. I'll just listen to the call. Good morning. This is an automated phone call from the transfer center on behalf of the patient. May I speak with the house supervisor, please? Good morning. How can I assist you today? I would like to inquire if Dr. Olivia Martinez is available to admit a patient, David Thompson, into her med surge service. What is the patient coming in for? He's a bariatric patient who has had a fever and cough for several days. The diagnosis is likely pneumonia. He will require the remainder of the workup when he arrives at the hospital. Additionally, could you please confirm if a video monitoring system and a bariatric bed are available in the room? Okay. So what you're seeing here is automated action. The agent calls three physicians, the first two to climb. The third accepts no repetition, no delays, just consistent, professional handle. Handled by technology, but informed by clinical staff. Behind it all, our agents are checking schedules, reserving resources. Priorities are adjusted. Notifications and alerts are sent. Shared situational awareness across what is often today, silos. This is how healing happens. This is first of a con capability in the industry, and critically, and critically, it is built with human oversight, transparency in the human and the loop. So teams can step in, escalate, or override at any point. With bed and equipment availability confirmed, let's kick off the transfer. So with a click of a button, the system starts coordinating every step of David's transfer. Using real-time location systems, RTLS, and GPS tracking, our system dispatches the ambulance to move the patient. The transporter to receive them, the environmental services worker to ensure that the room is ready and the biomedical engineer to ensure that the required equipment is on station and in the hospital room before he arrives. This is true coordination. No last minute scramble, phone calls, delays in care. As the patient arrives, the forewarned care team is instantly notified. The nurse knows, the emitting physician knows, everyone is aligned, and care starts immediately and proactively. We call this care traffic control, making sure that the patient, the room, and the team are in the right place at the right time. So throughout the process, operations IQ is capturing key metrics. How many calls the automated agent handled, time de placement, avoided delays in escalation, everything is measured. When you can measure these outcomes across an entire health system, you move from isolated insights to full enterprise visibility. That's where real operational transformation happens. Just as important, it frees up human staff to focus on what matters most. Political judgment, complex coordination, and compassionate care. And just as importantly, sometimes holding the hand of a patient at their weakest moment. So what you're seeing today is only the beginning. The technology will continue to evolve, forecasting patient needs, optimizing transfer timing, predicting bottlenecks before they happen. What you're seeing here in its simplicity is an integrated and interoperable platform that makes things move. Helping hospitals and health systems serve more patients with greater efficiency and improving margins, bending the cost curve of healthcare down while improving access and quality of care. So together with Palantir, we're turning chaos into coordination, guesswork, indigitance, and helping team shift from reactive to proactive. This demo is a glimpse of what is possible when healthcare operations are infused with actionable intelligence, automation, and empathy. And thank you for exploring this with us in the future. Thank you.
