TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

One major tool for Musk and Ramaswami's government efficiency agency could be artificial intelligence and Palantir is already in the game. And Thropic and Palantir announced last month that they're partnering with Amazon Web Services to make anthropics-clawed models available to US intelligence and defense agencies. The agencies aim to use the large language model to process vast amounts of complex data rapidly and streamline clerical tasks for the government agencies. And when you say streamlined, doesn't that mean saving money? And that's not the only positive news for Palantir in the past couple of months. The big data tech company joined the S&P 500 on September 23rd and has been on a roaring rally since then gaining 93%. Joining me now in a Fox Business exclusive is a man leading it all, Palantir, CEO, Alex, Carp. I got to ask you about the stock. It has been such a wild ride. You joined the S&P in September, but even before that, people who understood the business jumped in and said, we believe in it. I mean, that's got to feel really, really good. Almost a little bit like the world has woken up to something you already knew. And quite frankly, we already knew because you've been coming for about three years. Well, you seem to know it early. One of the few people who invited me on when I was a pariah, which was about 18 years of our 20-year existence. Look, things are good at Palantir. We said we said that the world is moving to software first, which no one believed. We said the way to build products is the way we did it, which no one believed. We said that you had to go back to what's now called first principles, what an enterprise should do, not what an enterprise thinks it should do. We believed in meritocracy and hiring the best people. We believe America is a great country and our enemy should suffer. And we built products around those ideas. And there are a lot of people who didn't believe some who did and those who did, we'll be rewarded. And we're kind of nose to the grindstone now. We're very focused on the US. US is doing very, very well for us and I think in general. It's a good time. It's a great time at Palantir. And maybe not so great for our doubters. People who didn't want to listen to proclamations of obvious truth, like an enterprise should work. This nation is great. We have the best people and have the best products. And we built these products that are basically were built years before people thought we were relevant. The most relevant one of now is how do you manage large language models and AI so that you can actually extract value so that and the values quantifiable, either on the battlefield to bring soldiers home, kill our enemies, or in commercial to change margins, reduce dwell time, make your reinvent your business. And one last point, one of the most important things people do not understand about AI is they understand roughly kind of how it could work. Of course, they also have noticed that many AI companies are the large language model alone, basically redo a science project. But the purpose of what you can do with AI is you can do exactly what we did at Palantir, which is build your institution the way it ought to be built, a country ought to have a border, a military ought to be efficient in both how it spends and how it kills and how it protects. An enterprise that's in manufacturing should be able to control the supply chain, should be able to control the workforce, should be able to manage people who are smart but not technical, technical, but maybe don't have business acumen. Those kind of things can be managed. Bringing an institution back to what it ought to be is the single purpose of what Palantir does and we're now able to do it, which is why our enterprise business in the U.S. is just very, very strong. I mean, some believable total commercial sales in the third quarter rose, what, 27% to $317 million? Well, the most important step for me. Are you trending the same or even better this quarter? Well, obviously I can't talk about, you know, I can't, well, unless you will be walking out of here and shackles, I'm already, I'm already, I'm already pushing the limits. But, yeah, no, I mean, look, the U.S., our U.S. business grew 44% last quarter, 44% with a latent basic non-existent sales force with me as a frontman, offending half of America or actually the other half loves us. I mean, the people that believe in truth and justice and meritocracy and having a border. And, but sticking to our guns, and we've stuck to our guns and the most important part of our business, that's commercial and government is growing at a very, and then there's this, for people who are in a business, there's a, there's a rule that's basically like a diagnostic of health and that's called a rule of 40. And that rule of 40, I think we have the highest in the world, 68, which means while you're sitting there, one of the biggest trends that we've had to fight against is the experts are only experts in this country at being wrong. Their expertise is, I'm wrong, and they're not even consistently wrong. And so when it comes to Palantir, it's like, oh, there are services company. Oh, you, of course, you have to build software so that it is, it is a parasitic energy on an enterprise instead of that it actually is aligned with the enterprise. And, you know, so that we are, the, the actual results force those experts to say, what the F is going on here. So I can see their teeth being spat out against the window. Well, isn't that what Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are doing right now? They're looking at government spending, government inefficiency. I mean, you just talked about making commercial operations more efficient, government operations more efficient. Have you talked to Elon Musk or Vivek about? Look, without going into all, Palantir, we want to support the US government. We want to support them. I completely support the mission. And I don't need, and again, there's two parts of the mission, making getting out waste, figuring out what works, investing in what works. But there's also, we need more, we have a, a derth of legitimacy in this culture. Almost all institutions that are in charge of measuring, fixing, doing things have low legitimacy. Whether they deserve it or not, no one believes when the ICC says something, no one, we believe they're any symmetric. We believe that the doctor is politicized. We believe our universities aren't teaching anything valuable. We don't trust that, and neither side trust, and the idea that like blue is right or whatever, no one believes it anymore. So we need transparency as the first step to reinvigorating legitimacy in this culture. And I wholeheartedly support what they're doing. And God knows you could not have a better person than Elon doing it. What if they come to you when they say all those programs that you're doing for the defense department, we're cutting back the defense department? Well, I look, you said all those things you do that, like there, I have a, I have enormous faith in both of them to figure out what's working. And Palantir exists to serve this nation. And I, I mean, we need to know what's working and what's not. And I think that's great for the nation and probably pretty good for Palantir too. You know, software, software, especially software that's productized, is enormously efficient. The underlying economics of software is both sides get more. I build a product, no one else can build. I sell it to you at a fraction of the cost of building it. I'm happy because I can sell that product everywhere. You're happy because you could never build that. Even, and honestly, if you had a billion dollars, you couldn't build it, but you might think you're going to get a billion dollars and build it. And of course, that doesn't work. Efficiency will not only make everything cheaper, transparency will not every only be cheaper. It will be the output will be better. And again, the primary basis of the U.S. economy right now is tech. The primary lesson of tech is you, you get the right people and you spend less. And you get massive output. And so like all these things that are likely to happen by looking at transparency are, they're going to lead to increases in transparency. And by the way, increases, increases in lethality. The AI piece of all of this has enhanced so much. Certainly, the work that you have helped the Ukrainians do and the Israelis do on the battlefield. But in the past, you guys have been very clear. It's on your website that you say, we believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it. But considering how far AI has come in just a short time, do you think that it deserves a little more latitude beyond the human? Well, there's a lot of super interesting questions like, for example, on the battlefield now, peer-to-peer adversaries. If you're defending against their missiles, you're going to not have time to go back to the human. But there's ways in which you can use software to code ethics into the program so that you get the data feed comes in from large language models and other AI systems. The large language models are not precise enough and the other systems may be precise, but they're not ethical. And you can have the decision feed into the software and the ethics human ethics can be encoded. But yeah, we're entering a completely different world. And part of the reason we're ending a collective world is we have pretty lethal and very competent adversaries. Is it too early to ask if you guys have considered AI-driven peacekeeping or conflict resolution software? The primary way to create peace in this world is to scare our adversaries when they wake up, when they go to bed, while they're seeing their mistress, whatever they're doing, they're scared. If you want to have peace in the world, that's how you do it. And that's that is our peace-gaving offering this Christmas season to our adversaries. We're going to help this government be more transparent, work with partnership in America. And our goal is everyone who does not like America, does not like what we stand for, does not like the the the the the the the the West thinks we're useful idiots is going to be scared and uncomfortable. More tomorrow than today. Well, that is a nice big bow around a Christmas gift. That is our Christmas present. Happy New Year. Happy seasons. Whatever you celebrate, please, you know, you know, and to all supporters of the Palantir, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year's. And to all people who've hated it on us, enjoy your call. Alex, never a dull moment with you. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you. Don't get up. Oh, sorry. You hated it so much. You're going to run away. All right, Alex Card for Palantir.
