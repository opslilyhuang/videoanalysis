Hey everybody, it's so good to be here. It's wonderful to see the team here because I came a few years ago. It was not as big as, as I said, it's fantastic to see so many people in a cutting-edge era participating in this. So I'm from Cummins as you heard. Big shout out obviously to my team who's also online watching right now. So great job guys for the award that we got. Thank you Palantir for what you've done and done continue to do, of course, in terms of recognizing the work that we did. I have a couple of things that I want to share with you in terms of how we were able to get to this success point out. I'm a little biased maybe. I've been using Palantir for about seven years and it's the second company I'm starting to use Palantir with and I'm starting to see great results. So with that, let me go through a couple of things. The balance with the right players and the right tools, it might sound very simple, but when you do this over and over and over again and realize that you're not getting too far with some of the technology and with the balance, it's very essential that you put that together. And in many of the cases, we've done so many in Cummins, so many projects, but in many of the cases, once that balance strikes and you have the right technology, it works like crazy. So with that, these are a couple of points that kind of guiding principles, so to say, getting the right team balance, getting a subject matter expert from the business, where the problem resides is critical. You've probably heard this situation happen in many cases where you'll get the business side of the function side saying, give me the data, I'll figure out what to do. Give them the data and then they'll tell you, give me one more column or give me one more piece of information. And now you have multiple problems. The problem that was one problem now, you have a second problem because now you're interacting with the person who's trying to build a solution for you. And the original business problem is still there too, so now you've got three problems to resolve. So this is, I mean, it happens all the time. So we want to run away from that situation, but you want an SME who has the trust from the business side or the function side, who's working directly with you and he or she is the center of the solution build process. That's what we were successful in doing in comments with multiple opportunities there. Now the three things that we did very effectively was connecting the information. You heard this over and over again, how important it is for a non-digital native like Cummins is, you're going to have data everywhere. And to bring that data in, you've got to have a very effective platform. This goes back to what I told you before. If you don't have the right partner, you're going to be spinning. So with Palantir with Foundry, it was much easier to make the connections work and connections work not just for one instance, multiple instances. In Cummins, we created a platform called the digital core where each of these connections that we made, we put into a digital twin kind of digital core into that repository and we were able to not refer that for various problems that were coming up. And that was a big deal because once you do that once, you get a result because you're solving for one problem. When you do it the second time, you're going to get exponential results and so on. But you've got to have the right technology to be able to access it fast, efficiently, smartly and all that. That's the difference between Foundry as well as with building ontologies that works really well. So with that, one big problem that we have, you could relate to this, I'm sure, this is supply risk mitigation, whereas suppliers could create a massive problem for you right through, right to end sales. And in our case, Cummins is a company that builds massive engines and massive gen sets for power generation. So there are tons of little parts that goes into these. And so you've got to have a fantastic view, fantastic hold on what the supply is. So we built a platform with Foundry and of course with ontologies to be able to drive that right through, take the risk out so that you had good visibility right through. So this project, the business sponsor of it, because we had a subject matter expert work with us, the business sponsor's line was, and it was a great line to hear, I've not seen this before as a solution. That's great to hear because once you do that, that means the business sponsor is going to invest again to do even more with you. So that's a big deal. Second one, I mean for us, this is a big deal. This is repair time reduction. So what we want to do is keep those trucks on the road as much as you can because the customer wants that to happen. If it's inside the workshop, it doesn't work very well for neither party. And if it's a warranty problem, it's even worse. So because we are paying for warranty as it's in the shop. So what we have done is we were able to go and take years and years of repair history. And then we were able to use augmented reality and then of course AI to be able to figure out the new code that comes in, what's the repair that is required for it. So by the time it comes to the workshop, you're ready with the repair and it's out. So prognostics working really well there again with the balance of these two platforms. So just to quickly summarize, what we were able to do with this digital platform was to be able to bring all these data sets as these solve for problems. And as each of these gets solved, creating a data pipeline, creating the visibility so that the subject matter expert can look at it and then get creative about new problems they can solve. And then we are able to create this interoperability with these data sets. And that's the magic. I mean connect, interpret, and act. That's the way we work. So with that, I mean, if there is more questions on details on what we did, more than happy to answer them. But for now, that's all we have done for the beginning. We have a long way to go with the relationship we have with the planetary. And then for this year, we probably have another probably 10, 15 projects that we would like to take on and do. And each one, we do, like I said, that digital crow gets even stronger. So with that, thanks a lot, Palantir, for the opportunity to be here. And thanks a lot, the coming steam. Great job, guys. Good to be here.
