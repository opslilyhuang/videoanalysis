TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi, my name is Han. I'm the head of security at HyperScience. HyperScience uses machine learning and AI technology to help process and extract data and process business processes from documents. We have partnered with Palantir for about a year now, utilizing their Fed Start program. Fed Start is a program that helps you accelerate your ability to sell to the US government. If you're a software company like us, you would know, and you probably have heard the term FedRAMP, it has some very strict requirements from a security perspective. You have to meet in order to do business with the US government. And Fed Start program helps you accelerate that process, streamline the compliance elements of it, and help you navigate through the complex challenges of the regulatory landscape. Cool. My name is Mark Franco. I'm the CEO and co-founder of NANFEST, or Software Supply Chain Security Company. Software is the only thing that we buy that doesn't come with an ingredients list. And that's a really scary and ultimately existential problem for the West, in that we buy software all of us around this room have procured software without asking what's in it. And so that lack of transparency in software supply chain is changing, and it's changing very quickly. It's changing in government, it's changing for federal civilian agencies, for DOD components, for the intelligence community. And so for us, we partnered with Palantir's Fed Start program to ensure that we could deliver our Software Supply Chain visibility platform to the types of austere environments that need it most. For us, one thing that we're thinking about in terms of how do we make the next five years compress into the next 12 months? For us, a big strategic goal is being able to deliver our platform into those austere environments, at a scale at which that we, as a seed stage cybersecurity startup, have no earthly business being able to meet. Fed Start, or excuse me, Fed ramp usually costs on the order of like $3 to $4 million and takes four years to achieve. And by partnering with Palantir's Fed Start program, we were able to do that for pennies on the dollar and get our Fed ramp high audit back clean in the order of three to four months. So it helped us scale our business and ensure that we can deliver to DOD, to federal civilian agencies and to the IC in order of magnitude faster than we would have other ways of being able to do. Yep. And so from our perspective, our goal is to bring automation and harness the power of AI for different enterprises. And so to give you an example, we've done a lot of work with the VA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, amongst many things that they do, one of the core services that they provide is benefit services for the 9 million plus service members as well as their families. One of the things that hyper signs did when we came in is to expedite the ability for the VA to process some of those benefit claims, which used to take, you know, in a matter of weeks, three to four weeks, and we were able to shorten that time to a mere three to four business days, expediting the ability for the VA to service our service members as well as their families and their benefit claims. So those are the type of efficiencies that we want to bring to the enterprise space, in partnering with a program like Fed Start certainly allows us to do that to the public sector, the rest of the public sector, but as well as some of the commercial sectors as well. And so looking ahead, thinking about, you know, where do we go from here? So I mentioned, you know, the software is the only thing that you buy that you don't get to know what's in it. We now have this new class of technology, AI, which we are now procuring without knowing what's in it. And so the next time you procure an AI solution, asking that next question of what models is used under the hood and what data sets were those models trained on, that's something that we want to be able to fold into the manifest platform, and then when we do deploy it through the form factor of Palantir Fed Start, so that we can inherit those security controls and we can deliver it to critical infrastructure, highly regulated industry. Yeah, and to wrap it up, I think we all know that today's business landscape is pretty complex. So one of the key challenges is how do we move fast, how do we adapt? And so our customers depend on us as service providers to them to deliver. And so partnering with organizations like Palantir and its Fed Start program is a dependable service that we can rely on to then be more dependable to our customers. Thank you.
