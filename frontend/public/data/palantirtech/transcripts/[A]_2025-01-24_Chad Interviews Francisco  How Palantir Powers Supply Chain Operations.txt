TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm Chad Walkwist. I'm going to architect that palantir. Today I've got Francisco Parga, good friend of mine. Thanks for joining me in Arkansas. Happy to be here. Pull must be warmer than it was. It is a little cold and snowy. So you have been palantir while you lead a group called Apex. How did you join palantir and kind of maybe your origin story? Cool. Yeah, I mean, joined palantir slightly over six years ago. My background is in engineering, real engineering, so aerospace engineering. I always wanted to be an F1 designer. Somehow, did that straight out of college spend six years working for Formula One teams in various different guises and enjoyed it, but realized that at the end of the day, you know, we're building this nice little stack of 300, 400, 500 million dollars and setting it on fire to get two cars to go around to track 20 times a year. And so from a personal satisfaction point of view, from a motivation point of view, I realized that actually, you know, like I wanted to work on something that actually mattered a bit more, that had more impact and then joined in 2018 or so. Yeah. So I met you in 2020, I think, middle with COVID. So everyone else knows that Francisco and I worked on the COVID efforts at Palantir. And so it was a lot of really cool stuff that we worked on together. Me as a customer, you as a palantirian. And like I think we've been through the trenches and done a lot of different stuff, whether it's bomb and material optimization to supply chain optimization to all sorts of stuff. But I said before you lead the group called Apex, what the heck's Apex? What is Apex? Good question. So Apex is one of the pods within Palantir, right? So one of the subgroups. And for us, it was how do we tackle and work on problems that were like very close to the execution space? Naturally, that meant we gravitated towards the supply chain space where most companies have to turn their sort of plans and strategies into reality, right? Do we have the right product? Do we have it in the right place? Do we have it there at the right time to serve the right customer? And so that's where we sort of started. We've done a lot of work in the supply chain space. But equally, wanted to keep it unconstrained, right? This is Palantir. We take on the hardest challenges, the hardest problems. It doesn't matter. And so right now we're working on pricing, we're working on accounts payable, we're working in supply chain, we're working on marketing. As long as there's an execution piece to the work, as long as we really want to focus on the how do we actually move the needle and how do we turn a theory or a practice into reality? Like we'll be there. Maybe you can hit on that too because that's something I've learned a lot about is like the difference between my plan and my execution is generally a very large gap. And that's where you play a lot, right? Yeah, I think, I think you know, we're trying to basically make a crazy non-linear random world into something that we can project and predict because that is the only way we can handle it, or at least that's traditionally how we used to think about it. And so companies will make plans, maybe they'll make a plan every week, two weeks, every three weeks, and then they'll go and execute against that. But halfway through that plan execution, things have happened, which means the second half of the plan isn't necessarily valid, right? And I mean, often our customers, you sort of, when I spend time with them, I realize great, you know, you spent $100 million in license software to create these amazing plans. And then when you go to a facility, when you go to a plant, you meet Mary, Joe, Mike, whoever that is the plant manager or the scheduling manager, and something will go wrong, and they'll open Excel, and they'll decide what they're going to do next. And so you really then wonder, what is the value of the investment? If you're not giving the tools to the people, the operators, and the people on the ground to actually sort of interact with that plan, interact with those optimizations in a way that is way better than just simply using a spreadsheet, and allows them to sort of generate plans that are sort of globally optimal. And I think that's the power of like, Palantir and the ontology is connecting not only the data silos, but connecting the business process silos that knowing the decision someone made over here ended up really bad for this person over here, right? And they have no idea. Yeah. And it goes back to sort of, again, the world is complicated. And so 30 years ago, 40 years ago, some clever people decided, OK, let's split the world into as few things as we can, that we can then control. So let's split it into individual business units, let's split it into individual KPIs we measure. And at the time, that was as good as we were going to get, right? A simple KPI could be, for example, your load up to my, you show your truck utilization, you know, full truck equals cheapest way of moving things. In practice, that kind of tracks, but then nowadays we're at the stage where we should be able to point at a box, at a case, at a palette and say, how much did this cost to move, right? We no longer have those tech limitations, that data limitation we had before. And so what that means is that we can move away from from these KPIs into a world where everything is measured in in in sense and dollars. And so we can make optimal decisions, even though they might not feel that way, right? If you think about it, the truck wants to be as full as possible, but if the effective and most effective thing to do is to ship a half full truck, then that's what we should be doing. Sales is going to want to sell as much as they possibly can, but there's times where the way you sell certain products is going to cannibalize sales elsewhere or put an undue strain on your supply chain or in some other way, shape or form effect, your ability to deliver, which means that globally it's not the right thing to do. And being able to connect those dots becomes really valuable because then everyone can make an informed decision. Leaders and companies can say, okay, I'm okay taking you hit here because it means that I actually perform way better in terms of logistics costs or in terms of OTIF and that actually overall that is way more valuable than ensuring that my truck was 99.9% full instead of 95% full. And that it comes back to like some of those other capabilities that I think are different. It is like cool. Now we talk about chained scenarios where I'm like, I'm changing a price here, which changes the demand, how do I do the supply chain, how do I produce the right product, do I have enough production capacity, do I have the raw materials, do I have the procurement, like all of those things need to be considered when making a price change. And you do that over hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of products and materials and places and locations and customers, it gets so hyper complex. And I think that's where also the power of like when we talk about chain simulations in the platform, I think that was one of those things that really blew my mind was, wait, so now I can model these global kind of considerations, but I can also simulate and understand that, well, if I try these four different things, what's going to be the most optimal thing before I make the decision. So coming back to that, how to make the optimal decision, can we, here's the, here's the trade-offs human, right? And I think that's super powerful. And I think, you know, you've been doing the Ford Deployed Engineer gig and out of the edge, like, how do you see that from like a customer perspective? Because, you know, like, I saw it, I was impressed, I was right by your side doing it was fun. But like, as we do that more, like, what do you see the value from your perspective, like a Ford Deployed Engineer? Yeah, I think, you know, obviously you have a fresh pair of eyes, which is, which is not well, but more importantly, I think it's sort of connecting the way corporate things, the way the world works, with how it actually works. Like, I think I'm always surprised by the dissonance there of like, sure, this is my architecture diagram, or this is how the process should work. Yeah. Or, you know, these are the tools they should be using to make these decisions. And then you go on site, you spend time with the operators, you spend time just looking and listening and experiencing how things work. And you very quickly realize, well, hang on a second. It's very different. And as soon as you start to put those things together, and customers realize, oh, hang on a second. Well, this explains why my previous three IT projects failed. You know, we thought the world worked this way. We forced people to try and work in that way. Obviously, they rejected it because that is not how they work. You know, but I think fundamentally, it's connecting the sort of reality on the ground with what is happening with our customers. I'm often amazed that I've been to more facilities than a lot of the people I'm talking to in the corporate space. And to me, it makes no sense. Yes. I mean, that's day one activity. Just like, how do I go see what this person's doing? How would I go work in the plant with that? That's often the first thing we say is, like, cool. I understand that this is how you think the process works. Let's go to a plant. Yes. Let's not talk about anything else. Let's just go look at it happen. Yeah. And I think, like, I love how Sean talks about this from a standpoint of like, the Ford to point engineer is going to eat the pain of those people and excrete product that works for them. It's a lot of fun too because, you know, being able to see how our customers can shape the product into what's really needed, not what fits on an architecture diagram or what some VC back start up is trying to sell you. I think that's really the differential is like, our software isn't built in this vacuum. It is built at the edge with our customers for that feedback. Which is super cool. There's this sort of, I don't know if it's intellectual laziness or what it is, but it's just like, I want to throw an AI model at it and I want to get an answer. I don't want to think about the process and the reality is that to go from data to action, you then have to go and understand what the process is and how it works back to the Ford to put model and then represent that somewhere. And I think that's what the ontology does so beautifully. It takes those data concepts and then layers on the reality. So layers on how those things relate to each other. What actions may occur, what other things may affect it so that you can build these chain simulations. You can build these digital twins, these alternate realities. Yeah, and now I've been doing this long enough. I think the way I would distill down as well from like what you're saying here is I was very much focused on like, how do I create this technically sound place that all the data is together. And I had to build it into a technical dimensional data warehouse so that my BI tools work on it. But all every single step was was aggregating away, distilling away all the value, the ground truth of how things really worked because I had to put it in a way that then the systems work. So you had to then force people to adapt to this kind of pseudo technical language. And you lost a lot of the like the detail and the clarity and the data and the decisions, right. And I think that's the difference in ontology is model it how it actually works. You were stuck in the corporate paradigm. Yeah. You have to find a way to model it and the world isn't black and white. It's this varying shades of gray that need to be modeled in different ways. And I think the ontology is excellent for that. I think another thing that is another instantiation of this another way this is brought up is the concept of out of the box. Right. A lot of customers are like, where have you done this before or, hey, I can buy an out of the box solution for this. And I think that's that's kind of the logical next step from, hey, I put everything together in a system that was totally unopinionated. And I couldn't get anything to happen to, okay, I must put it in a system that knows exactly how the world works. But that neglects to accept that your business is going to be different to the way the software developer, the built that out of the box solution thinks the world should work. And that difference is often your competitive edge. And so you have two options then you either implement the out of the box solution and change the way you work and give up your edge. Or you implemented you should have decide that is the way the world works. And then three weeks later you realize everyone's back to excel because that's not how they operate. Yeah, exactly. I think that that level of flexibility in ontology to really model how things work in the real world and create that kind of that feedback loop as well. Because it's not just single direction reading. It's like we're talking about actions, recording back to the ontology what things giving feedback on agent workflows. Like there's all these things that ontology powers across that. I'll give you a really simple example. So the first project I was on when I joined Palantir was Skywise with Airbus, where we were deploying Foundry to 100 plus airlines across the world. You'd think airlines all work fundamentally the same way, right? They sell tickets, they put people on planes, plane takes off, plane lands, you get off, hopefully they have an illustrious suitcase and the way you go. But every single implementation was subtly different because some airlines operated aircraft with four engines, other operated aircraft with two engines, some only operated one type of aircraft, others operated every type of aircraft known to the to mankind. And so even in an industry that should be as regulated and as sort of homogeneous as the airline industry, we still found that the ontology was valuable and allowed you know, allowed a low cost carrier to operate the way a low cost carrier operates, allowed a full service airline in the Middle East to operate the way they operate and allowed us to have US-based airlines to operate very differently. Even though fundamentally they're doing the same thing. Yeah, I mean because we hear this too, the similar thing though, like, okay, I've got to get my ERP upgraded to clean up my data, so then I can do these cool AI things. And I think this is where we really try to flip it on its head with things like Warp Speed and others is, how do I actually inject AI into these things to clean up to move these processes forward without having to do all that? How do I make more data computable with AI upfront instead of just the chat side from the user interface? But also, how do you shift from theory to action very quickly and very early on, right? You can spend months or years running a master data management program to try to improve your master data and to find that like 70% of the attributes you don't actually need to use for these processes. And along the way, the business is still running. So you're somehow making decisions on master data that you know isn't correct. So why not layer on the technology and the automation early on to highlight where those issues are and actually fix the things that really matter? I think we find that's really useful with a lot of our customers. One of the main objections we often get is like, oh, whoa, hang on, I've got to get my data in the right place first because I can't do this. And it's like, well, you're already making those decisions with that data. You're telling me it's incorrect. It's even more reason to try and do this early on so that you can highlight the issues faster, better, and not rely on somebody correcting them using Excel or using tribal knowledge that they've had for working out the company for 20 years. Yeah, and I think it really comes back to the best way to fix data is to try to use it because contextualizing that in the transaction, not all master data is great. It's equal. This one piece of master data might be tied to a billion dollars of business and this other one is tied to five dollars or nothing. And if you just look at it from master data perspective, there are two pieces of master data. And I think that's where contextualizing it through using it, applying it also will highlight those things that then we create that feedback loop to fix it very much quicker. And it's not to say that that's not important, but you know, if you're going to learn how to play golf, you can read the Wikipedia article. You might read one or two, but there's only so much you can read before you just go to pick up a club and go swing it, right? I think it's the same here. Slightly different context, but fundamentally it's the same thing. Yeah, you really got to get that muscle memory and for doing the activities, which I think then also from like just on the master data point of like the it's pushing rope most of the time to try to get people to go fix master data if that's just the outcome you're trying to drive. But if I have a new initiative that's got real ROI tied to it and I can show that these five pieces of master data are in impediment, that's a much better way to get people to act to go fix it. Yeah, you know, it becomes a massive carrot. You know, with a lot of our deployments, what we do is we'll set it up where version one will have a big red button that says master data is wrong. This is what I think the answer should be. And when we go live, we collate all of that and we use that to go fix the master data. And so what ends up happening is the end user when they log in the next morning says, oh, okay, this is correct. I finally don't have to remember that I'm not shipping to this location. I'm shipping to this one. And they see the value and correcting it. They see the value in updating it. And it just becomes the sort of flywheel effect where, you know, within a few weeks, most of the data that actually matters is correct. Well, so you're what you're really bringing up in my mind is the power of the ontology plus LMs together. Really because you've modeled the data, the logic, the action of your entire business process, it means when I need to be agile and change things, I've got the process already mapped out. And these agents can now reason through about how to fulfill the request you have about A for these next 50 things do this. And I think that's the power where the ontology really unlocks the true power of the machine-raising components with LMs, right? Yeah. And because the ontology represents the business in a high fidelity way, the LLMs become incredibly sort of explainable. You sort of mitigate a lot of the sort of risks that often people have around hallucinations and things like that, whereas like, hey, I am telling you to do this because the model did that when I changed this input, and you can see the five downstream effects, and they're all logical, and so therefore, like, I have good reason to believe that this is correct, right? That transparency, that openness only comes from things like the ontology when you layer LMs on top. And LLM is much like sort of Michelangelo. If you gave Michelangelo a toothpick and a block of marble, you were going to go nowhere. The ontology is the chisel, right? It's the ability to understand the business in its current guise, not in the guise. It was when the model was trained six months ago. Yeah. Like, what is my disposition today of product? Where are my trucks? What does my demand look like right this second? All of that only becomes available to an LLM through something like the ontology. From a business impact, we do all this. Like, I know we've talked about it and we've done together some pretty cool, like, impactful things, transformational to business. Like, do you have some examples you could share of like, what does this look like anecdotally? Yeah, I think fundamentally, every time you go into a store, a good chunk of your favorite brands will have in some way, shape, or form interacted with Foundry. At some of the largest protein manufacturers in the country, we're redeploying product on a daily basis, sort of minute by minute, and moving anywhere between $200 and $400 million with a product around the country every year to make sure that product is on the shelves, on time, in full for you to buy, and minimizing the amount of product that gets wasted through expires. Like, that sounds so simple, but it is so complex at scale. Like, you're saying, tens of millions of things a day being produced across tens or hundreds of facilities with distribution centers, trucking, transportation, different customer requirements, coordinating all of those all the time, millions of times a day. That's super complex to do it effectively in that scale, right? That's where I think we come in versus an out-of-the-box solution, right? And I think that's something else that becomes really important in terms of embracing complexity and just really understand your business, really understand how things work and why they work, such that when you get the opportunity to prove the things that are really hard, you can then start to look at Genai and Elams and those kind of technologies to do that. Yeah, which is really, I think, the setting up the stage for the automation. It's like building that digital twin of your business process, connecting all these things, understanding the third and fourth order kind of problems is great, but once I then encode that in ontology, and now I have Elams that are only increasingly getting better and better at an accelerating rate, that means my machine reasoning about what to do is getting better and better. I think for me, that's what's exciting over the next year is like the enhanced capabilities that I can't even fathom today, like what am I going to be able to do in six months? And I think everybody that has encoded their business in ontology is going to be so far ahead of everybody else when it comes time for the true kind of AGI experience with Elams, right? Well, thanks for insisting go for coming to Arkansas and having a chat. It's always great to hang out with you. Yeah, always a pleasure to come down to Arkansas, Chen.
