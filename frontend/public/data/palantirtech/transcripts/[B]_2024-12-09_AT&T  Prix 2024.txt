TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello everyone. You may be familiar with AT&T in some way, shape or form, hopefully your customer, if not, would love to have you. You may not be as familiar with our journey to be the best communications provider in the US, and that's something that we've been working on for the last few years and really evolving our governing and our operating model to bring the customer to the center. And we've continued to expand our wireless network, our fiber network. We are still the largest capital investor in US communications infrastructure, and it's a journey that we continue today to really, again, serve the needs of the customer and win in this space. You know, my team sits in the Royal Internation Supply Chain Organization, and we partner with our chief technology and our chief data office and all of our business partners across the company to bring the right technologies, the right partners to bear, to serve the needs of the customer ultimately. Palantir has been with us on this journey for five years. We've been working with them on a variety of use cases. Network was one of our biggest first customers, sorry, internal users, internal clients, and continues to be a huge, huge user. We have use cases around network equipment management, incident management, a variety of different areas. As we take a look at 2024 and reflect on the year, we want to touch on three areas where Palantir fits with our operating model evolution. First is AIP. We've adopted AIP. We have integrated AIP with our internal generative AI tool, ASCAT&T. We built this tool to be a safe, secure, responsible tool for folks to be able to use and proliferate throughout the business and be able to get the most out of this technology. By incorporating this and integrating this with AIP, this is now a building block that teams can use across the business to deliver applications that are important for our customers ultimately. This is a great building block and a great pattern and helps us drive some consistency across a very large disparate organization. Second is our governing model and how we look at actually supporting a special generative AI work in the business. We started to centralize generative AI team within the company and a program to support risk management, drive value, of course, reuse of patterns, reuse of different technologies and consistency really across the business. This is of course as you guys know, a crazy pace that we've been on the generative AI space in the last year and a half or so. By having these patterns for Foundry and AIP and having that connectivity back to some of our other cross-functional data sources within the company and cross-platform tools, we're able to move a lot faster now. We can bring use cases through, go through the risk process much quicker. We have really made strides in the last half of this year to be able to move a lot faster in that space. Even for an organization of our size, it's their still bureaucracy. There's still room to improve, but we have really come a long way. And then third, you know, really are resourcing and our capabilities internally. We have built a lot of capabilities even outside of that network organization that was really the champion from the beginning with Palantir to have other organizations be able to deliver things. In a lot of cases, they're able to build applications by themselves. And now we have a growing dedicated team that is able to support the needs of the business within our chief data office. So combined with that team, some of the capabilities that are proliferated through the organizations that we have in the company and partnering with the Palantir engineers as well, we're able to deliver a lot faster than we have in the past and a lot more use cases that drive value. You know, it's really, it's an incredible thing to see how we can drive in your value with a lot of these things now and go from experimentation to production much faster than we have in the past. You know, 2024 was a crazy, crazy year. We knew it was going to be all about generative AI. The pace has been blistering so far and we certainly are excited for 2025. Thank you.
