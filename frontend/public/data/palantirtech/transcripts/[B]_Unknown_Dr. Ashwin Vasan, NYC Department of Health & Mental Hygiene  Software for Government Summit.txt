TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hey everyone, thanks for having me here today greetings from the far north. Great to be down here in the muggy swamp of DC. Hope you're all having good day. This has been a great event so far. I really want to thank Palantir for having me here. I'm Hirsch and particularly has been a great thought partner over the 18-19 months that I've been commissioner and really thinking about, you know, we talk a lot about public health infrastructure and we'll talk a little bit about how we're focusing on this in New York City. But data, you know, I think I hope that you'll see from a local perspective, although New York is sort of quasi-statal. Data's our superpower and I want you to see that from my lens. I feel a little bit, you know, unease because I'm not, maybe I should have sent my sort of like data officer or my chief data people or my chief epidemiologist here because I'm surrounded by people who are in the throes of working with data. But I want to tell you what it's like to use these data from a leadership perspective, from an institutional perspective and from a transformation perspective. And I hope that that'll be compelling. I'm not totally out of my depth, although maybe I will, you'll, you'll, you'll disabuse me of that. You know, I am an epidemiologist, but I'm also a primary care doctor and so you know, I'll try to bring some of that lens in today. I also want to thank our federal partners, Dylan and the group from CDC and Asper and HHS for for being here. We work so closely with you and one of the lessons from COVID amongst the many is how important it is for cities like ours to have a direct line of communication with the federal government for planning for rapid response. So really grateful to you for being here today. We're obviously here to tackle. The last thing I'll say is like I haven't given a talk in a long time. I give a lot of speeches. I was saying to Dylan earlier as I give a lot of remarks. I give a lot of speeches. I do a lot of events. I shake a lot of hands more than I thought. This job is far more political than I thought, even knowing it was political. But so forgive me. I don't have, I don't have a lot of sexy slides. So it's certainly not ones that move and change colors. I mean, what's Jason doing like putting us to shame? What's the federal government spending money on? Come on. Come on, guys. Fancy slides is not a taxpayer priority. Anyway, we're here to tackle big questions, right? About data, tech, public sector and how they come together in service of a brighter future in an our case and our focus is a healthier and more equitable one. And so with these like lofty aspirations in mind, I want to begin with a very important pressing question that I'm sure is on the top of all of your minds. Do you like cilantro? How many of you like cilantro? How many of you hate cilantro? How many of you are indifferent? And different to cilantro. Okay, well, you know, personally, I love it. Obviously, I'm a guy of South Asian descent. I grew up eating it. We all know someone, perhaps we are someone who insists that it tastes like soap. And no matter where you fall on this controversial issue, you probably think you're right, right? Because how do you argue with that? Taste is taste. But it turns out that cilantro or coriander or d'anilla in our language, like whatever you call it, it's not just a matter of good or bad taste. Cleveland Clinic says that about 10% of people have cilantro aversion written into their DNA. In fact, we track it across populations. I don't know who's paying for that. But anyway, let's hope it's not federally funded. So, I think that the government are actually more likely to detect soap notes. There are often variations by race and ethnicity, social and environmental factors, play a role. Like if you grow up eating it at your dinner table, even if you're one of those people who are predisposed to it, looking or tasting like soap, you can actually develop an affinity for it over time. So, let's imagine you're making food for a block party and you ask around for opinions before you decide whether to put cilantro in the guacamole. Obviously, depending on who you poll, you'll get answers from women, you'll get answers from certain ethnicities, and your results could vary differently. You could also vary differently when you asked. If you do this during summer or if you do this in February for Super Bowl. But as I know from the clinical perspective, as I know from the Health Commissioner perspective, individual data points can't tell the whole story. And when you're in a locality, like New York, you would think, gosh, we're making all these really strategic decisions and we're making these decisions with the best data and we see the whole field. You'd be surprised, maybe you won't be surprised, how a loud voice with a data point or maybe two data points can drive an entire conversation. Maybe you're not surprised because we saw that during COVID in spades at every level of government. And so that's sort of my orientation as I think about this. Like how do we get a better sense of how to make the most rational decisions possible? What happens on when we're deciding on something more important, like when there's conflicting information about a cancer treatment or a vaccine we're deploying at scale or protection from an emerging health threat. Or when we're looking to invest in the right communities at the right time with the right strategies to prevent health crises or mental health crises in a city of in our case, 8.5 million people. So when the data is clear and there isn't or there isn't trust in the data that's being presented, the consequences are certainly life and death, not cilantro. And of course you see this at a patient level and I'll talk a little bit about how I see that as a clinician. I still see patients, but I'll more importantly at a planning level and as an epidemiologist and as the commissioner of health. We're obviously living in a world of overnight experts spur of the moment, hot takes and a lot of misinformation. In fact, at the health department we developed a whole unit on misinformation within comms and our data unit just to say, how can we work more rapidly and more granularly to push back on overt outright mistruth. But we have to arm ourselves with the best actionable accurate data to make the best decisions we can, but also to really push back and cut through some of that noise. We saw it during the height of the pandemic, of course, so many of us anxiously monitor dashboards and transmission rates to make smart and safe decisions we needed to know exactly what was going on in the world around us. And we needed to trust the sources that provided that data in New York. Our public health system really stepped up and we became the go to resource not only for understanding about the pandemic in our city, but for making decisions on how to navigate it. Whether those choices were individual, like do I get on that plane and go see my parents or institutional, when should we bring back our thousands of workers to the office. The data system that we built was really a heroic undertaking at a time when the stakes couldn't have been higher, but underneath its surface and many of you will know this, it was a system held together by paper and Scotch tape and string and enormous amounts of human time and effort. So more on that later, COVID of course showed us the glaring gaps in our current health infrastructure. As the world shut down around us, those of us in public health had to then step up and build many of the resources that our country needed and has always needed, including data systems providing that timely and accurate information. But it's not just about being ready for those big global emergencies, right? What about those individual urgency and health crises that people and patients and communities face every single day they add up over time. So let me put my clinical hat on for just a minute. You know, medicine is not always straightforward. I was talking to Dylan about this earlier. I know I was talking to your boss earlier about conflicting information from clinicians and undermining trust and credibility. Treatment plans are often built on trial and error as you know and bodies are unique and deeply affected by our environments, science evolves. How can providers do the best work though if we don't understand our patients unique needs beyond the science? Or where to even turn to for the most up-to-date data that you just can't? And I've been left holding the bag as a provider many, many times. It's particularly true when you're caring for people in vulnerable situations. I see it in my own clinic where I take care of mostly Medicaid, Medicare and underinsured or uninsured people. I still see patients. And I have maybe 20 minutes with them, maybe 30. And that's not a lot of time when I'm trying to make a decision about chronic pain or get to the bottom of memory loss and disability or aging. But make no mistake, particularly as a primary care doctor, I'm the quarterback. I'm the quarterback of my patient's care. And while I might know medical history data and some things might be fed in through social work and other providers at my hospital, Columbia's where I practice medicine, I can't, I rarely see the whole field. You know, patients without access to consistent housing might struggle with medications that have to be refrigerated or taken on a regular schedule. Those without access to public transportation may struggle to attend recurring appointments in person or to get their regular infusions or treatments. And if a patient doesn't get paid time off or doesn't have economic subsidy, a biweekly checkup can be impossible or possible in result in huge financial losses. What if they live in a food desert and can't realistically follow diet guidance or can't take their anti-retroviral because they're not getting enough nutrition or food in the first place? What if they're incarcerated and we have to coordinate data and systems between prison medical and insurance systems? This is also an equity issue. And it's not just an issue for individual patients. We have dozens of different hospitals here in New York City, there in New York City. Thousands of different clinics, independent providers, public and private who all have their own data and they're all working in silos. They're all drawing conclusions about our city's health based on what they see in their own data. And telling their story, often telling a story about New York based on their own cohorts to drive their own operations. That data is incomplete, especially in a city like New York where attribution of patients is a myth. No, patients do not stick with one health care provider, health care system. And it's not necessarily the failure of these organizations per se. It's really hard to match these data. We have got a lot of privacy and data sharing considerations and legal and regulatory issues. They may not also be aware, I mean, if you're just managing a clinic or even a clinic system, you may not be aware of all the data points that are skewing your population data. And of course, we have to name it, right? Business incentives play a major role in this. But as a health quarterback, whether in my role as a physician or even the city's commissioner, I need to be able to huddle with my receivers and my running backs and communicate and execute the plays, call an audible if need to. But you can only do that if you see the whole field. And right now we don't have a coordinated way to do that for our patients, nor for our populations. And we need one urgently and data must be its foundation. We need a single hub where health teams can work together using the best data possible that reflect the sum of the patient as best as we can manage, but also bring in community data, population needs risks and identify opportunities to intervene and deliver better results. So how is data collected in New York City today? I mean, you're going to be familiar with a lot of this, but I really want to bring some of that local flavor so many of you work some of you work locally, but a lot of you work here in DC and maybe you don't spend enough time in localities. That isn't a criticism. That's just fact, right? You got a job. You got a life here. But historically in New York City, as in most jurisdictions, we track health statistics through surveys, right? Cross-sectional questionnaires delivered to households that ask people to self-report health conditions as a doctor ever told you you have X. In New York, that principal surveys, the community health survey or CHS developed over 20 years ago combined with our vital registries, which are much, much older, obviously, these data begin to paint a picture of who's living and who's dying and from what. And sometimes rarely were able to even attach to those surveys biomarkers. And Haines was the great example at CDC and nationally, we did NYC Haines, which was launched by my predecessor and former CDC director Tom Frieden. But again, nearly 20 years old now. In New York City, like in most localities, we also have a robust system of surveillance based on 72 reportable conditions, mostly infectious, and ones that organizations, healthcare organizations are mandated to report to us. During COVID, of course, we also built a syndromeic surveillance system. Slides aren't working. Now they're working. Perfect. A syndromeic surveillance system, which was initially built for flu, but which quickly pivoted to COVID. And this was unique, right? All 53 emergency departments in New York City started delivering a symptom data who's coming with a fever, who's coming with a cough, who's coming with hypoxia, who's coming with elevated or very low hypertension, low blood pressure. So this is a really important start. And I want to I want to make sure we we stay here for just a moment because the it's rare. It's rare that we get clinical data from every single major health facility in a geography. Again, it's just a small window, right? It's just emergency department visits doesn't count doesn't capture ambulatory care. But it's a building block, which I'll get back to. We also over time have developed dozens and dozens more data sets, right? We have we track birds and deaths, of course, immunizations, we have our own registry for that. We have we have some data from emergency departments like here, money, many, many more data sets all working in the main in silos. Our practitioners and researchers, of course, have used this information to find patterns and to better understand what our health concerns are most pressing for certain communities and where to target our programmatic and policy initiatives and our investments. So limited resources can go a long way. And so we can address the cumulative effect also of disinvestment in communities, right? We have certain communities in New York where they've gotten a proportionally smaller share of resources and we're seeing that in our health data. It's the basis of inequity. So during COVID, we were able to build a system that for the first time tracked citywide cases, tests, vaccines, hospitalizations and outcomes. We also made open source data dashboards that served as the single point of truth for New York City. We didn't have a back end where we saw data. Yes, there was more data collected, but whatever was published on our website was the very same data that we were using for planning. Everyone was using it from the guy in the bodega on the corner to myself and the mayor to CDC and WHO in terms of their willing their interest in the pandemic in New York City. It was the source of information for tweets, news stories, and it created a definitive basis for us to also push back on misinformation and mistruth. This system was pretty revolutionary for our city, but the amount of labor and upkeep it required was totally unsustainable and we've had to draw it back. It relied, it also relied on some very outdated platforms. As I said, Scotch tape and string. So today, more than 20 years on from the development of routine annual surveys in New York City, we are a wash in health data from electronic health records and clinical systems to health and mobility data in apps, information in payer systems, medical claims databases, and health data collected by social service agency, which isn't talked about nearly enough, but as we know, social drivers are disproportionately impactful on overall health. Most of this is locked up, not able to be shared in part to do a complex and patchwork legal regulatory and governance system or an overly constrained standardized one. But it's also locked up because we don't currently have the technical means, at least not ones that are in service of NYC public health to organize these data. The bottom line is that data and technology has left public health behind and it's time that we caught up. That's why over the last months, my team at NYC Health has been working behind the scenes and in the next several weeks we'll be ready to launch a new center for population health data science. A place where we can bring public health, medical and social service data together in one accessible database that informs policy, program, and practice across the five burrows. A place that leverages historical expertise in EPI, survey design, and research and superpowers them with enhanced capabilities and centralized capabilities available to our leaders across our public health system, program designers, and subject matter experts. This will truly be a city-wide, area-based population health surveillance system that can track conditions acute and chronic, reportable and non-reportable, emergent and known across New York City. What we built for COVID has laid an early groundwork for this. But we need a real and modern data architecture to support it, dedicated tunnels and cloud-based and query-based systems, automation to make data aggregation easy, AI and ML-powered cleaning and matching as just a start for AI's rule. Powerful analytical tools that can report, analyze, visualize, model and forecast data, and the ability to build internal capacity in New York City, in government, in cost-efficient and timely ways to ensure the sustainability of the system, and the ability to scale it and adapt it to shifting threats. That way we can tell once and for all the single truth about the health of the city. That doesn't require our team to work 18 hours, days, seven days a week for an entire year or more to keep the system together as we did during COVID. Over the coming months and years, we will build out this center, create a bridge, a bridge built of data between healthcare, social, and public health systems that can transform population health. We need to do better and our workforce wants to do better. They just need better tools. And AI will certainly be the way we make this work easier if we embrace it. Once this data is being shared regularly or on demand in a cloud environment, we can begin to aggregate information for a host of conditions. We can track the influence of certain social and economic risk factors like income and wealth, housing and transportation, nutritional and environmental threats. And we can even bundle risk factors together to start to see which ones are co-occurring, co-linear, and where we might find those on a place-based way and where we might drive investment. Equity is at the center of all of our thinking here. So how might this work? We're building out some use cases now. We're starting with respiratory viruses and what we built during COVID. How do we streamline and automate the infrastructure that our dedicated teams can turn- so that our dedicated teams can turn to the real work, which is predicting the impacts of seasonal respiratory viruses, forecasting and segmenting their analyses by risk groups, and allowing our program designers, planners, and even our financial systems to deploy resources to where they're needed the most in order to save lives. We're beginning that now in the fall of 2023 and we should be finished with a prototype by the end of the year. We're also focused on our opioid crisis. We will soon release data that shows 2022 was the worst year on record for fatal overdoses in New York City. In 2023 based on preliminary data is on track to surpass that. Fentanyl is wreaking havoc on our city as it's wreaking havoc on cities all across this country. It's really the most urgent public health issue we face today and right now our data is too slow and it's not granular enough to adapt our response. We're working through models to bring together EMS data with hospital data, with criminal justice and social services data, and to match it with medical examiner results so that we can not only see where overdoses are happening and exactly to whom, but also predict where overdoses will happen and plan our responses accordingly. One last example is our Medicaid system in New York City alone. We have four million Medicaid recipients, all of whom receive different types of care. And patients data is stored in different systems as you know, hospital and birth records in one place, primary care and ambulatory services in another place, if not part of a different, a larger system, social service records and snap records like snap records and yet another database. And on an individual level, this information is an indispensable and instructive to any clinician who wants to offer the best care possible. That only becomes more true at a population level. How can I recommend new program or service benefits from Medicaid patients as commissioners when I don't know how many of them are up to date on their screening or regular checkups or getting routine labs or receiving housing benefits or snap benefits. How many of them are able to meet their nutritional needs. So as a part of the Medicaid 1115 waiver, which is currently under discussion between New York State and CMS, and in line with our focus on health equity, we are planning, we are developing and planning to propose models for consideration by the state to bring together a wide range of data around the problem of birth equity. Linking community hospital, doula and midwife data, home visiting data amongst others, and linking it to a proposed payment bundle, in fact, under the waiver, so that we can finally leverage our healthcare spending for community interventions that make the biggest difference in closing what is an unacceptable black white maternal mortality. Maternal mortality gap in New York City and this country. So a center for population health data science helps these systems operate together. When powered by AI, of course, we can compare and contrast these distinct data pools to find patterns that inform policy and program decisions that we have to take as an institution that I have to defend as commissioner. And we're part of this bigger movement, of course, to harness the power of information at a national scale. I'm grateful for CDC's presence here because we've started the process of building the center on the back of the DMI, the Data Modernization Initiative. I hope I haven't stole any of what you'll talk about. I don't think so. But the support provided to jurisdictions like ours, and we're one of few directly funded localities, as you know, has been essential in building this center and getting it off the ground. Of course, we'll need more than what's available through the DMI, but it's catalytic. And as I said, you know, what we've learned during COVID, once again, is just how interdependent our systems are. So we will also benefit from all the growth and change happening at CDC on the common operating picture, the front door work, as well as the center for forecasting and analytics that. Dylan will describe a little bit later. We rely heavily on federal data to run our programs, and but they also rely on us for understanding and resource and accurately resourcing states and localities where the work is actually happening on the ground. We need a stronger data ecosystem to make it happen, and the nation's biggest city should be a best in class example of what's possible. We protect and improve the health of a diverse millions. Our city's public health infrastructure needs to be able to plan and resource public health at scale, and we need a surveillance system able to do so at the most granular levels, whether zip codes or even down to city blocks. We need to be able to plan our interventions to reduce risk at a population level, but also advance equity at a community level. We have the talent in New York. We're actually blessed with a lot of talent, but we can't do it without more resources, which is why we're also pretty disheartened by the collective amnesia that we're seeing here in Washington after what we've been through over the last three years. Cuts to the CDC and cuts to public health. The cognitive dissonance of this wakes me up every night, and I'm just like, what are we doing here guys? So let me leave you with one example, and that maybe this will get to a little bit of the what are we doing here and why. We've made incredible strides, as you know, in advancing extending American lives. In 1919, an average person in the United States could expect to live to only age 49. In 2019, that number was 79. That's a miracle, right? And when you look at those 30 years, almost all of that is attributable to public health, whether vaccine preventable diseases or environmental interventions, clean water, sanitation, food safety, antibiosis, and advancements, and surgery and medical care. More recently tobacco control and clean air and clean water initiatives. This is a miracle. And yet our hard-fought gains, this is New York City data, pretty stark. Our hard-fought gains are under threat. New York City experienced a 4.6-year drop in life expectancy in 2020. And yes, you would expect that to be the case since we were the epicenter of COVID. But when we start to unpack the 2021 and further data, it's not all coming back. Because while COVID may be lessening, we're seeing parallel pandemics increase overdose, as I mentioned. Cardi stubborn chronic disease deaths, cardiovascular and diet-related disease deaths that haven't changed, if not slightly increased. Increased violence and suicide driven by mental health concerns in part. So when we start to look at this, it's not inevitable that we're just going to get right back to where we were. And particularly the US data that dotted red line, it's pretty stark. Pretty stark. We've flatlined. You know, I think the question for us is really when we look at our peer countries, OECD countries have almost entirely regained their years of life expectancy that they lost during COVID in 2020. We are not on track to do that as a country. And we spend at least twice as much as the next counterpart on health care. So I have to ask us all, what are we doing here? And how can data help us solve it? I'll end with this. I was chatting with Dylan, as you can see, I've been chatting a lot with Dylan today. But I was also chatting with Jason and he was comparing his career in national security with his learnings and health. And how quickly and how ambitiously defense has really moved to make data driven decisions and how relatively laggard health is. I'll propose this. I think that somewhere we have a collective project in national security. We have a project that says there are some things that are bigger than all of us protecting Americans, securing our borders, all of that stuff. These are all things that we kind of agree with as a country broadly. And while there's plenty of commercial incentives within the defense industry, those commercial incentives are always aligned and in service of, or at least we can drive them in service of some common goals, whether real or ostensible. In health, we don't have any common goals. We do not have any common goals in health as a country. Not ones that we lead around, organize around, hold people accountable to. Most of those goals are just driven through our revenue based health care system. So the commercial incentives in health and health care are really creating operational dissonance. And we need to get around a collective project. I think life expectancy and a promise to Americans that we are going to be a healthy democracy that where people can expect year on year to live longer, healthier lives, people of every background. That's our collective project. Without that, this superpower of data is going to be solving meso level and micro level problems. But we need to put it to service in advance of, in service of macro level problems. And I can't think of a bigger one. So thank you for your time. It was a pleasure to be here. I hope you learned about how New York City has seen these issues. Thanks.
