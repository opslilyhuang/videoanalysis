Please welcome from Hospital for Special Surgery Chief Digital and Technology 
Officer Ashish Barad. [Music] Hello everybody. Uh so I am Dr. Ashish Barad. I'm 
a practicing physician for roughly 20 years now. Um, and um, you know, wi with that being said, 
the the work we're doing with Palunteer um, is is really exceptional. I can't wait to 
to dive in uh, from that perspective. Um, there's an interesting fact that I want to 
open with that you may not know. So, uh, since I started practice roughly 20 years ago now, uh, 
physician productivity has dropped roughly 13%. So just think about that for a second. Nursing 
even more significant, right? So I did a time study recently. Our nurses spend a roughly 20% 
of their shift with um their uh patients. That's a lot of hours, a lot of time on paperwork, 
administrative tasks. So um we um we are taking that on and that's and I want to make a very 
significant portion of that is after we digitized everything in healthcare. So although there's 
still foxes do exist in healthcare um we um have digitized everything and yet productivity has 
dropped 13%. So our our partnership with Palunteer is really focused on giving that time back so our 
front lines can spend time with their patients which is what they went to nursing medical school 
to do. So before we dive in, um I do want to make sure that many of you may not know what HSS stands 
for. It's a hospital for special surgery. We're in New York. Uh and it really is the premier 
destination for muscularkeeletal health, right? Um and you can read the stats. Uh we have 
many of them. We're very proud of them. Um but I'll I'll leave you with this just as far as the 
the hospital goes. uh during the NBA playoffs uh when your Achilles tendons pop, you come to HSS. 
So, uh it is absolutely the place to be. So, uh you know, I'm going to dive into a demo uh to 
show you something u different that we're doing now. And I know you heard a lot about appeals 
with Main Health. Uh so I won't spend as much time um on this slide but I do want to say that at the 
beginning of this year we partnered with Palunteer uh and we decided to take on that same journey 
of automating insurance appeals um and uh and as a physician appeals authorizations insurance is 
the bane of your existence oftent times. Um and we really took that on end to end and what we found 
was 45 minutes of manual work by a lot of people uh really just doing chart searching and typing 
letters uh and taking on the insurance company companies uh went down to 5 minutes and we did 
that work in five weeks. We've been tapping that for decades. Uh so in a simple fiveweek time 
frame we were to automate all those and and what we could get to to about 100 appeals per month to 
insurance companies turned to a thousand appeals a month and so it wasn't and and so the efficiency 
was tremendous but I also want to make sure that we don't just focus on efficiency the performance 
of the AI was better than the people that were doing it. So, um, and that time for those people 
was given back to higher, uh, license work. Um, and so, uh, it was a, it was a big win for us. 
Appeals, you heard a lot about it a bit ago, so I won't spend too much time on it, but I do want 
to make sure you understand that roughly one in 10 appeals um, or uh, claims in healthcare claims 
is denied by insurance companies. So we spend a lot of our time and energy of manual labor, 
our nurses, our doctors, our staff on really working that um through. And so um if you really 
uh think about the the fact that 17% of healthcare uh or 17% of the GDP is on healthcare um a lot 
of that has to do with this what's called waste in medicine. This is an example of that waste. 
It's really not in in any way helping a patient uh a person get care. it's really just doing a lot 
of uh manual labor and work uh paperwork. So to automate that is very significant uh for people 
getting care. Um so uh that's work that we've already undertaken. We continue to do and um is 
really significant. We expect a lot more things. So, you know, having that win under our belt, 
we we said, you know, that's wonderful and we've automated a lot of the back end, but we haven't 
really touched the patient and that's the center of care that has drifted a bit in healthcare. We 
spend so much time on the paperwork. We spend so much time in the administrative work. We're not 
spending as much time with the patient as I just articulate at the beginning of this. So, how do 
we get that time back? How do we really get the patient back in to the center of the care? The 
medical record that we've had in healthcare isn't really focused on the patient as they go through 
a journey. It's very siloed. And so when you show up to a clinic, you go to the hospital, you get a 
phone call, you may go to different specialists, you might go to an imaging center, all that data 
is not following really you along in a very, you know, continuous way where the care teams are 
are really reading off of one sheet of music. So that's the work we're taking on with Balanteer 
now. Uh so we started four weeks ago. Um and so um really all that fragmentation of care um at 
best it's a poor experience um at worst it's critical details that get missed right leads to 
poor outcomes um so we're building a patient card is what we're calling it right so really just a 
single sheet of music it's a single living summary that travels with the person as they go through 
their journey allergies medications care plans what's next predictive uh and it's consistent 
everywhere. So now you have clinicians, all clinicians, surgeons, doctors, uh nurses, medical 
assistants, patients, very important and payers, right? They are part of your healthcare journey 
all reading off the same page and that is not possible in today's world. That data lives in 
different places. So it's living as I said. So the card updates right with real time in real 
time. So orders, results and decisions change. So I think at the beginning of this uh you heard 
from American Airlines and in many ways I think of running an O and I've done that before in 
my past life um is like American Airlines, right? We have crews, we have turnarounds, 
we have clearances, we have equipment and the occasional emergency, right? The difference, we 
actually encourage sharp objects. So in this case, uh we're seeing a patient that's not ready for 
surgery uh as she needs a lifestyle medicine referral. Right? So you see that the ontology 
puts a flag there. Take a minute because right we're if you just watched this demo you might 
not really capture what's happening. Take a minute think about Zoe. She's your mom. She's your 
spouse. She's your sister. She's been hurting for years. She needs a knee replacement. She lives 
in pain every day. She finally got to the best place on earth to get her knee done. And and the 
surgeon said, "You need surgery. can't wait to be painf free right now let's dive back into the 
demo right because that person is waiting and and can't wait to live painf free and so you see 
AIP running it raises uh a flag there's a risk so in seconds right it's assembling the relevant data 
BMI tobacco use meds problem list it checks player policy clinical criteria for medical necessity So 
what you see now is because she's not yet cleared, AIP is automatically compiling and submitting. 
The agent is submitting as well the prior authorization packet with the right documentation 
and it's alerting the whole care team in real time with a clear reason code and next steps. So what 
you see is that she needs counseling for smoking sessation and for weight right management. And 
so that is a uh criteria that is both needed by the insurance company and the right thing to do 
for Zoe to ensure that she gets uh that in check before she has surgery. Current state that is all 
data that lives in different parts of the chart if at all. Right? And that is something that really 
if it gets picked up great oftentimes it doesn't get picked up right and either again at best you 
don't get paid for the surgery you're doing and at worst at least the bad outcomes because that's 
actually the right thing to do for the patient. So here you see that she's moved through this 
process and Zoe has moved into presurgical square uh screening. her cardiac clearance is in and uh 
the living patient card stays current across the teams. The information that's being put in there, 
the whole team's seeing it. And really what's transformative about this agent that you're seeing 
as far as next steps here is in a few clicks, right? It's recommending same day discharge. 
So now that she's had lifestyle medicine, she actually qualifies for same day discharge. 
She can go back to her own bed. she can sleep and she can have her caregivers there doesn't need 
to stay in the hospital right it's notifying the whole teams that has a huge just like an airline 
industry let's say has a huge implication on the surgeon needs to know the nurses need to know the 
clinicians the operators need to know uh insurance u may need to know so again single pane of glass 
it's messaging Zoe patient in the loop right that is right now potentially nurse's job to remember 
her to call Zoe and say, "Hey, you actually qualify for same day discharge. We're going to 
move up your surgery to be able to do that." And that's a manual thing. And it takes time away 
again from that 20% of time in the patient's room. And we have a second customer in healthcare, 
our physicians, right? So, and making sure the surgeons in this case are aware of this move 
and this recommendation and with consent offers to move the surgery time. So, it's one source of 
truth, coordinated actions, and zero swivel chair. Hi, this is an automated call from the HSS 
call center. Can you please confirm your full name and date of birth? Hi, my name is 
Zoe McMillan and I was born July 27th, 1961. Hello, Miss McMillan. This is HSS scheduling 
calling from HSS. I'm calling to inform you of a change to your upcoming surgery schedule. So, 
we're not going to play the whole recording for the sake of time, but um it's right to have that 
conversational AI to be able to guide having that um source of truth to be able to guide 
that conversation and to recommend same day discharge. Um and if you listen to 
the recording um which would say, well, I can't do 11, can I do nine? Right? it's able to 
accommodate that knowing the surgery schedule. Um, so really really getting the patient back in the 
loop and being able to have that shared decision- making with patients that has oftentimes been 
missing. So again, this is where we started with a schedule with the red flag and this is where 
we land, right? No red flags. Schedule optimized not just for the patient but the clinicians, 
the surgeons, the o texts. So no red flags, everyone in the loop. Again, we stood this up in 
four weeks. So, as far as speed to action, we're just getting started on our journey. We're taking 
the entire patient journey, right? From discovery, ouch to recovery, right? And we're going to 
use AI to orchestrate that. Very important. We're not taking our frontline clinicians, our 
doctors or nurses out of the loop. We're actually elevating them, augmenting them to do what's 
necessary that humans should do with humans. AI is a really wonderful orchestrator. Things 
get lost in the middle, right? And so that's how we look at it. So our goal is simple, 
right? We want our people with our patients in their care journey and we want the agents to 
do everything else. Thank you. [Applause] [Music]
