TRANSCRIPT

Hello. So I'm with FISNA, which is a really weird name. It's short for physical DNA. And what we do is we take 3D data, we analyze it, and we extract from it insights that allow customers to make really fast decisions. Fast decisions are really what we're all about here at FISNA. I'll share some examples. One of the things that you're seeing right now is parts standardization is one of the things that we're used for. So by analyzing these 3D models and how they're related to each other, we're able to create this ontology essentially, based on 3D that allows for things like saving a lot of money through parts standardization. It allows our customers to do things like design parts faster because they're able to use not only the 3D AI, but also 3D search to prevent redesign of the same product for no reason. We're used for finding parts and suppliers quickly and reliably. And what's especially powerful that we do and that we're really expanding on right now is our ability to make predictions using AI about 3D models, about the parts that you have, right? The parts that customers rely on. And what you'll see here on this slide is that we're making a lot of predictions about this part that you see, but obviously you can probably deduce that we can't just use the geometry to know things like how much it costs and what materials are used and how it'll perform. For that, we need broader data, we need the metadata. And what got us really excited about working with Palantir, especially with Founder and AIP, is that Palantir has that. They have this really great amount of data that they collect and make actionable and ontology. And what's really great about the synergy here is that when you know how the 3D models are related, you know the geometry relationships. And you can see the broader data about parts throughout a company, you actually get this multiplicative value add so that you get even deeper insights into these parts. And that's what's got us really, really excited about working together with Palantir. We're actually announcing our partnership with Palantir literally right now. Our press release is going out here momentarily. We've started partnering with Palantir a little bit earlier this year. We're working together both on commercial and DOD customers. And what's been really great about working with Palantir beyond the technical synergy and the commercial synergy that I was mentioning before has really been something that I really value, which is the culture of speed the Palantir has here. We're a smaller, younger tech company compared to Palantir. And it's really refreshing to see a company that's larger and more established that has still managed to maintain that culture of working like a startup, working really fast. We have to in our space work at this rate. We often tell the team when it comes to things like timelines, reasonable timelines or just in luxury that we can't really afford here. And when things do get slowed down, it's typically that we're working with a third party on something that's a lot larger, a lot more bureaucratic. And they're just not able to move the same speed so it slows us down. Palantir has really been an exception to that rule. And it's been really great working with them. And I think Palantir can actually serve as a great case study for other companies as just a proof that you actually can at scale, still work at that speed, still work like a startup, still move quickly when it comes to development timelines and business models, et cetera. So I was supposed to say thank you to the great folks at Palantir. We've been working with you recently. It's been amazing working with you, very refreshing to see that that culture can exist at a larger company at scale. And we're super excited about this partnership and the near future together. Thank you.
