================================================================================

From everyone at Palantir a very very very Merry Christmas happy Hanukkah and a truly wonderful new year. This has been an extraordinary year for Palantirians, the world over and our supporters, the world over. We got into the S&P which is a sign of the juggernaut that our products created. We made people understand that ontology is the power engine that makes LLMs actually useful on the battlefield in the commercial arena. We are at the core of making the obvious superiority of the West not just a moral platitude but a factual reality in industry especially in America on the battlefield both for America most importantly as the leader of the free world and for our most important allies. We are grateful to the people who installed our product help us build our products and have used our products especially those that are in harm's way even as we speak. Also exceedingly grateful to all of you individual investors who took the time and opportunity and had the courage to look past conventional rusty, crusty platitudes and look at our company as it is, talk to our actual clients and people whose enterprise we're transforming and put your own money at stake. And on this Christmas all of us Palantirians are very very grateful for the role we play in making the West stronger, better and undergirding its superiority as a force of good and something to be reckoned with and on occasion feared. Thank you.
