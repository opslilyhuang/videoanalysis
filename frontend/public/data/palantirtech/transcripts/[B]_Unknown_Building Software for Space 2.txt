TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Palantir is a non-traditional company. We push the limits to explore how software can enable fast and accurate decision-making about our world and beyond. It was that sense of curiosity and innovation that brought me to Palantir in 2015. My name is Kelly Gerardi and I'm a mission obsolete at Palantir. I'm also a bio-astronautics researcher, a mom, a space enthusiast and soon to be an astronaut on a dedicated science mission. My career in the space industry has been non-traditional, from leading software teams to testing technology and microgravity. Through it all, I'm proud to be a part of a team that tackles the most mission-critical problems facing our world. The national security landscape of space is complex and data in this domain is exponentially increasing and valuable. The ability to harness data so that it can be operationalized, a five-strategic advantage. In the arena of near-peer competition, Palantir recognizes the imperative for U.S. and Western allies to strengthen our enduring advantage. To do so requires a resilient data architecture. Soon after the founding of the U.S. Space Force, we began supporting the Guardians' data-heavy and highly technical needs. Palantir's platform serves as the data backbone for the Space Command and Control Modernization Program. We're pushing the boundaries of what it means to bring software as a service from Earth to space. Our products are responsive and interoperable across all domains. By deploying AI into orbit, Palantir enables users to ask time-sensitive questions across the entire planet, obtaining insights to help deter, detect, and defeat threats. Palantir's metaconstellation identifies and integrates a mesh of existing satellites to optimize hundreds of orbital, terrestrial and aircraft sensors and AI models. Metaconstellation determines which sensors are available to schedule coverage over a defined area. With our edge AI technology, micro-models enable satellite sensors to detect objects of interest and rapidly reconfigure the orbiting satellite based on mission need. Maintaining an enduring advantage in space is dependent on the ability to innovate. At Palantir, we lean into unconventional ideas and approaches. It's what powers us to develop the technology of tomorrow today. Join us.
