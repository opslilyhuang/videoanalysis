TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

My name is Dan Rickard. I run veteran programs at Palantir Technologies, I'm a proud Army veteran, Beat Navy. I am Jason Hague, I'm the CEO and founder of Leashes of Valor. We provide service dogs to wound into stable vets free of charge. And I'm also a Marine, so Beat Army. I guess we have an Army Navy situation. We do. We do. When we first connected with Leashes of Valor, we were just really inspired by the shared values that we had about caring for veterans, giving them the exact thing that they need at their point of need. And that's really important to us. Yeah, and that's the biggest thing about this partnership is being able to provide these life-saving dogs to every veteran that needs one. Whoever needs it. It's one of those things, if you don't experience it, it's hard to quite describe. When you have a furry wing man like this guy, it is just his constant presence. They just have a way of reaching out and connecting with you. My social anxiety is really bad. Justin has helped me with being able to give the kids their typical childhood. After receiving them on soon, it changed my world. I was able to go out in public and not feel lonely or isolated from everybody. I mean seeing these service dogs from Leashes of Valor, being able to impact veterans in their moment of need is incredible. You can see that they are able to do things they just weren't able to do prior to having this companion. It's giving somebody a new life. Giving them all the senses. A life-chaming opportunity and that is something that we all are very proud of being able to provide.
