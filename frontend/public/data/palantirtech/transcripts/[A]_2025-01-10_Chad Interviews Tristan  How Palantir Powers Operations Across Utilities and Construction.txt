TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hi, I'm Chad Walkwist. I'm here today to talk to the head of our construction and utilities pod, Tristan. Tristan, thanks for joining me. Chad, it's great to be here. Thanks for having me in the studio. Arkansas studio as it has become. So maybe you could start off with tell us a little bit about how you join Palantir and then maybe your background here. Yes, so I'm closing in on five years of Palantir joined just before COVID, which sort of set in motion my path at Palantir worked on a lot of emergency response during 2020. Did some supply chain workflows for the COVID PPE supply chain and then started working in utilities and have been there for the last four years. Yeah, well, five years around Palantir is actually probably a pretty long time. So that's awesome. What was your background? So I have a background in data analytics and sort of business and math at the same time. Yeah. So it wasn't applied data analytics for a startup for four years beforehand, sort of experienced all the growing pains of establishing a stack with a lot of different pieces. Yep. When I joined Palantir and I saw the platform for the first time, I was like, where was this for the last four years? I think I could relate with you. I'd like to go ahead and write a shift. Yeah. So you've been here a while, but your background was data analytics. How did you end up in really the construction of utility space? So very typical, I think, Palantir story where we weren't where we were needed. So we started in 2020 working with PG&E and to become sort of the digital backbone for all of the operational turnaround. Worked on that project in a variety of different roles and then started our work with So Cal Edison, Southern California Edison, putting in place a lot of similar wildfire mitigation practices that we had established as best practice in the Bay Area. And then around 2021, with a couple other Palantirians, we saw sort of a need to bring these same platforms to the rest of the industry and sort of have grown our practice 10 fold cents. Yeah. And yet we're barely scratching the surface. There's a lot more that we can do with each utility and there's a lot more utilities that have yet to work with us. I believe it's really important that we work with all utilities in the US that we build a really, really valuable product for them so that they run more efficiently because all of the economy is downstream of utilities. And so if we can help them operate more efficiently, increase the capacity on the grid, build more efficiently, be more productive, it has ripple effects across the economy. Yeah. I love like, I mean, it comes back to the overall mission of like, how are we really going to re-industrialize the US? It starts upstream with having the power to be able to do these things to power the AI to do the re-industrialization to build the other things. That's all based on this, which is that overall mission of Palantir. And I love that you've got this big section right in the middle that you're helping drive it. That's pretty cool. It's really three things today. It's how do you build more capacity through construction much more effectively? Second is how do you upgrade the current infrastructure by spending every dollar more wisely and in a more targeted way? And then third is operating the current state of the grid in the most reliable way. So we've been talking a lot about the ontology. Why is it valuable for utilities? For utilities, the ontology enables the organization to look at the infrastructure, the assets on the infrastructure, the work that's been done on the infrastructure, the risk surrounding the infrastructure, whether that's whether environmental risk from proximity of trees. Believe it or not, it's really hard to actually all of these see all of these things and then be able to orchestrate decisions in real time on top of it. And so, and that's very extensible. You can bring in a new skater system and then look at telemetry. Visibility into this, this ontology can support workflows across the organization, whether you're managing outages, whether you're managing communications with customers or you're managing how to upgrade the infrastructure. Now that's fascinating. The ontology really is the core of how you model how the world really is not in a system language for a report. I think that's a differentiator from a lot of things and people don't understand that the power of the ontology is because you're modeling that ground truth that then enables all of these other use cases and these other things. And along the way, we have to deal with bad data and imperfect data, right? Yeah. But having the ontology gives us more information to work with. So we can sort of fill in the blank sometimes because we have information geospatially that enables us to infer what a missing data point could be. Or we can reconcile different systems. For example, a common thing is SAP will have a record of the installation of a poll in the field, but another system will have the record of the retrieval of that poll in the field. So if you only look at SAP, you think that there's all these ghost polls in the field, but they're not there anymore. So having the visibility across these enterprise systems is actually really hard for utilities and extremely differentiated. Though one of the hardest things about new technology is actually the people that change management. So what does user adoption look like? Well, you know in those high stress, high consequence environments, the bar is very binary. It either works and it works better than anything established or it doesn't work. And that's the bar that we hold ourselves to. So every use case we put out production has to meet that bar. Now these use cases are so valuable in the data data data day life of our users that they're the ones creating the waterfall of use cases that influences the roadmap. So a customer like PG&E that has been with us for five years, close to five years has more than 100 use cases in production. Another one of our flagship utilities customers in the Pacific Northwest has put 30 use cases in production in their first 12 months with us. Wow, wow, that's pretty impressive. There's a lot going on in utility space. Like what's the impact? What are we doing? Utilities are at the center of a lot of trends in our society. Right. And so our role in this industry is really upstream of the whole economy. And that's why we started working on transmission construction and our pod is spanning utilities and construction because we were exposed to that problem of space coming out of utilities. That's very cool. And in the last two years with large language models, we've seen the construction industry become a really important vertical for us. LLMs are particularly applicable for them because the whole industry runs on documents, PDFs. So AIP has been really, really levered in helping get this information into the ontology, having those documents talk to each other through the ontology network. And so we're seeing use cases across the lifecycle of construction that are leveraging AI. Wow. So it's not just though I'm going to extract some information using OCR through really understanding what's in those documents, ontologizing the relationships between things that is unlocking the value. So then like once you have that, like what are people doing with it? So I got all this unstructured data now. I have access to it. Like what's the use case that people didn't leverage with that? It's really two things. It's getting the data out of these unstructured data formats and then automating the processes that rely on them. Whether it's automatically sourcing the best supplier, negotiating quotes down, producing quotes, producing engineering documents with AI, always with a human in the loop approach. It spans the whole lifecycle. Yeah. You bring me up a point because I hear a lot of times like, oh, my data is not ready for AI. But I would argue and it sounds like you're arguing that same argument is actually that's the perfect time to use generative AI and AIPs to actually make sense of these things because you can start to infer and fill in gaps. I think there's a lot of paralysis because of bad data, right? And I think the first step is understanding what's actually bad and the ontology is able to shine a really bright spotlight on the gaps in the bad data. And then you can actually have a plan of action to help improve the quality of your data. Yeah. There's no better way than trying to actually use it to figure out what's wrong with it. Exactly. Yeah. It's cool. The construction industry is really interesting from that perspective because there are notorious laggards in tech adoption and they've for the most part haven't jumped onto the data warehouse data lake house cycle of analytics. Oh, really? And LLMs and the current cycle is a great way to catch up and shortcut all of that and not have to invest in a data warehouse, a data lake house, but immediately go into operational use cases that are applicable to the construction industry, whether that's estimating the cost of a project, scheduling, managing suppliers and subcontractors. Well, I learned a lot today like the importance of utilities is not only playing like what I'm interested in with AI, but just a part of our whole country or daily lives. It's really critical and I love that we're using AI to help the utilities be more efficient to help make sure we have the power for everything else we need. Thanks for making the trip. Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure. Yeah, it's great conversations. Likewise.
