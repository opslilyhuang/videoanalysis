TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Our therapy apartment have to create a daily spreadsheet on average about 92 minutes. Since the rollout of the Pell and Tertule, we have decreased that amount of time to 12 minutes per discipline per day. Our numbers are about 10 and a half-ish, more patients per week than each discipline can see. We volunteer, we are able to seamlessly integrate data across manufacturing, sales analysis, clients, product support and procurement. As we continue to embrace this powerful platform, we are confident that we will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Shimiya at HDE. The RENFRO has committed a simplifying insurance. Using AIB we can do that better than ever with claims in them. Our new automated claims to UAS is working. Regulatory vets were spending 8 to 10 hours prepping for a risk card, coming through databases trying to uncover information on every horse that's entered for that day. Heiseechek is going to simplify this process. The Palantir tools that I want to go out set. With Foundry, we gain visibility to our production and scheduling systems which we never had before. I can't say how much I love Palantir, it's made my life so easy at work. Our AIB is the most important thing in our life. To run different price-in-grace scenarios, it will take us a couple of weeks. And now with Foundry, we can have different price scenarios in a couple of days. The real gain figure has the real learning system that is in pretty much the same as the labor. Thanks to the ontology, exporting data and building them for report, we'll take them all longer in a minute. It's life-giving to have a company, inject themselves into the fold. I'm not certainly on the easiest, but the hardest problems we're facing. Right now, that's wildfire minimization.
