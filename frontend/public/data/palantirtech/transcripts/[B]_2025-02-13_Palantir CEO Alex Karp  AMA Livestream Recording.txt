TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right, we are live. Welcome to the Dr. Carp AMA. My name is Eliana Eunice and I'm joined today by volunteer co-founder, chief executive officer, author Dr. Alex Carp. How are you doing? Doing well. Doing well. Yeah, no, I figured, well, first of all, I always wanted to do one of these for largely because so many of the people who helped make Palantir the modest company it is today are individual investors and actually people who have a Palantir, the Palantirians who have built Palantir, kind of feel like individual investors. And then there are a lot of questions that don't really get answered in a normal format. And the nominally, I'm so so do a bunch of these things for this book tour and I figured, well, why am I talking to the general public after I talk to my fellow warriors when I can talk to my fellow warriors first, put you guys first. And then yeah, so happy to be here. And I guess we have random questions coming in. Yep. So we got, thank you everyone who submitted a question. We received, I think anywhere between five to six hundred between X, LinkedIn, Reddit. So we really appreciate what he submitted a question. We're going to go for at least 20 minutes here today about 20 minutes. And yeah, so thanks again for joining us today. So Dr. Carp, first question for you. By the way, I just went everyone to know in the public. I told the story before, I'm only called Dr. Carp because in the beginning, we had no money, we had no clients, no VC would back us, we were running out of money. There was no reason that I should be running the company, no one inside the company thought I should be running the company. And every smart person, every expert thought we were either crazy or stupid or clowns. And the only thing anyone could believe in was I had a PhD. And so then, you know, it is just stuck. But yeah, so any case, thanks for that, but it's not a requirement to call me Dr. Carp. I kind of always look behind my back and wonder if they're talking to me even now. I feel like if I called you Alex, I'd start melting. I always wonder if it's like, would people call me, it's really funny because I often think, okay, well, maybe I would have made my parents even happier and become an actual doctor or I feel like it's a slightly rust-gain film. So I'm not sure which one it is, but I guess it's neither now that pound years so real. Yeah, well, it's definitely real and we're going to talk about why it's real in a second. So first question I want to dive into. Anyway, you haven't even told the story of how we met. Now that you're so famous. Well, I appreciate that. Well, we met at, we've actually met three and a half, three years and some change ago at the Reagan National Defense Forum. You, I was actually supporting the Palantir team because Roger Zachime, we were so unimportant at the time. We were partnered with each other basically. And so, yeah, no one thought defense tech was a real thing. Yeah, well, you were super impressed. You were super impressed when Dan was like, oh, you know, he's a big Palantir fan. It was almost like at the time three and a half years ago, there were fans of the company, but the fans of the company were at the company. So we didn't have many fans on the outside exactly like, like, Ange Cousins. Yeah, yeah. Well, a lot of my friends and, you know, family they thought like, what is this PLTR? Why do you keep talking about it? And so, I was introduced to you and you asked me, after a few questions, you asked me, what would you do if you were off your job Palantir? And I said, I'd start on Monday. And we started. Yeah, start on Monday. It's been, been awesome. So, well, thank you for, thank you for what surprised you the most. I think just off the bat, the level of ownership and there's not like a structural way to do things. You kind of identify a problem and then you're sort of giving the opportunity to do it. Well, I also identify the person that solves the problem. So it's, it is like a myth that I identify the problem and it gets self-solve. But it's actually you identify the problem. Also identification of the problem also presupposes you understand what the problem is. It may not be the problem most people think is a problem. It may actually be something people think it's working. And then you have to find the right exact right person almost Carmichael morphed to do that role and somehow convince them that this is what they should do. And that is basically how Poundary is built in every, at every part of Poundary, the product, how we built the product, where we go to market the, our way in which we ignore conventional wisdom, the way in which we're biased to win. Yeah, well, let's just, there's actually that kind of touches on one of the questions. So first question from Fast Finance, he stated that Poundary has a history of attracting and developing exceptional talent with many former employees going on to build successful companies of their own. So you kind of talked about this a little bit. Could you share some insights into Poundary's hiring process? Is there something that you look for in particular or some of that you encourage that organization? Well, there are many phases. So the first phase, it was like the founders and senior people meeting everyone. I hired first 45500 people personally. And then there's how you get basically given more responsibility in Poundary, which is increasingly like after the first 500 people, increasingly my role, though I try to dip into recruiting just to kind of basically taste test what's going on. And still, it's very hard at Poundary to get a job if you're not quantitative without me interviewing you. And we hire very few people like that. When we were viewed as a joke basically in Silicon Valley for up until maybe two years ago, the only thing people wanted to talk to me about was how did you recruit and retain what arguably is the most talented group of people involved in software production and history of humanity. Certainly the Poundary degree is the most important degree in tech right now. Or it's like it doesn't one of our big strengths is you know there's crazy talented people at colleges all over the world all over America, especially. And you know most of the talented people aren't at Harvard Yale Stanford, but you come to Poundary or the Poundary degree is definitely more important than any kind of Ivy League degree, which was very different than when or Stanford was not Ivy League, but very different than when we started and even in the co-founding team it was heavily, it was four of us from Stanford one from the University of Illinois. And I would say I look for I always had very very short interview. So like people used to like sub five minutes sub three minute because I always felt that once you allow people to talk longer than that they they start talking about what they've learned to talk about. So you you basically see if the person's been taught to have the right answer as opposed to whether they have any form of original thinking. Pretty agnostic to what that original thinking was, but you know I felt like I could sense if someone had taking problems down to the right level of abstraction. And then then there's also how did we how did we identify and how did we hire one of the things I did a lot of in the beginning I still like to do is like once we had this this guy who we'll mention is name because I don't think it wants to be famous, but he's certainly the most talented engineer I'd ever have interviewed or acted with. And like a standard hiring process it would be like three days, but this guy like you don't if you're you're an idiot if you need three days to figure out this guy's smart. Did you so it's like oh it's like you know if somebody walks into your office and they're clearly the best in the world at X you don't need to put them through three day hiring tests so that all that says is your organization is so stupid they can't recognize this person is the best of the best of the best and then and then and so but the as an overarching rule for these things all these things require specialized abilities and it's interesting the ability to hire correctly and the ability to produce good software as an example are not as correlated as people would think. They are somewhat correlated but you know like my my track record of hiring town I mean actually one of the funny stories was because it palatable everyone has a high discount rate on everything in the beginning they were like well how why should carpe doing the hiring and so they would they would send in like purposely send in people who are kind of decidedly bad and then I would come out like why are you guys sending me this person and and so you know I I have a longer riff here which is that you know the the linked to AI where dyslexia was an enormous disadvantage it even even in building pound chair because in in fact even though I did some coding you're imposing a taxonomy onto the world and that taxonomy allows you to control things which basically language and software and different forms of software work better for different things because they have a different taxonomy but if you're dyslexic you you have a you have a attenuated relationship to taxonomies of all kinds and so where does that play into all these decisions that I'm pretty proud of having made including a lot of the hiring promotion is somebody who's got outlier talent is whether they realize that or not has an attenuated relationship to the subject matter they've they've been taught that's the nature of outlier talent so it's easier if you as a dyslexic or have attenuated meaning a not one-to-one relationship with with formal language to recognize somebody who's going into the that zone where you're above while mastering it and then that I think that's a lot of the reason now with large language models where you know they're being essentially commoditized everything at every normal person into the only valuable thing which is what you're seeing across businesses is tribal knowledge individual knowledge specialize understanding artistic ability is captured in a business or in the battlefield and obviously you know they're being like dyslexic is a superpower but I think that's really how that played through yeah and kind of feeding off of that so it's I think it's pretty even well documented about our culture here got a number of you know I think the experience you're just speaking anecdotally has been the experience of a lifetime Garcia one of our friends on on X I got a mad respect mad respect the man as an artist mad respect I respect yeah I see your stuff yeah yeah I send it I send it also yeah it's a mad respect yeah so Garcia actually I like the height here Garcia visited the office and he was impressed he met a lot of people talked to them he could really feel the passion so how do you mean to have you been able to maintain the culture for 20 plus years you know I would say you know when you're doing great art it's very hard to explain why the art works and so the real answer is no one really knows but I can't tell you they're still magic in this building and it's not actually less now you could say if you said well where was the magic the most there was this very very very special moment in like the first couple years but of course that was also solidified by the fact we were almost dying every day like you know no one knew how we're going to pay the bills and I would say and but I would say that there's a special but with the exception of that moment which honestly I'm not that interesting going back to it's it's probably most pronounced now look they're just obvious things that like if for example if you come here and ask me a question at you're going to get pretty much the same answer that you see me on TV that maybe maybe a little more vocabulary here a little bit yeah maybe a one or two jokes I wouldn't tell publicly but really it's so it's like we are inside an outside coherent I like a lot of times you'll I'll talk to people about those you know thinking about joining a company like I met senior leadership and everything they're saying internally it's different than what they're saying externally we for 20 years we valued meritocracy fairness purpose um you know the way we manage talent gives people a lot of responsibility so it's like it's really an alphdog which is the German term for mandate so you get pushed to the edge that creates a lot of pain I would say you know we have 4,000 current palanterians and roughly 4,000 ex-palanterians it is a pain it can be very very and also because you have to negotiate with other smart people you have responsibility but there's like in normal companies you're like chief executive for BS problem 2524 and as long as you deliver on that you know but at palanter like if like no matter who you are you're gonna have to some point explain what you're doing now the conversing of that is like when you join here and you're like 24 like you could be sitting on one of the most important projects in the world uh and so that but I think it's been the convergence and I would you know in all slightly monstery we've just been right I mean that's like I'm supposed to I'm supposed to show people the book you're supposed to buy but in any case the large the diversion of that is you know for intellectuals that's like intellectual treatise of what the reason why some of the we think some of the things we do but you know I also did this thing for somewhat you know individualistic reasons like we were fucking right yeah so and if you're right about a lot of things uh that what happens especially with very technical people they have a huge discount rate which is a fancy way of saying they don't believe anything you're saying until you're right yeah I look I think I think we can all agree palanter has a has a as a world class mission you know you're providing the west with the best software capabilities I think my observation is what you've done masterfully and what I think is just unbelievable is how you make every single person in the building feel like they're contributing to that and I think that's kind of how I would sum it up well I mean I take that as a huge compliment uh definitely what I want and uh you don't always succeed but I mean I hope that's true um next question is coming from a guy named a mitt I don't know if you've heard of a mitt we have like yeah master it's like it's like every OG well they're actually good questions we shouldn't call us the AMA she called it OG a we yeah we can do a close yeah maybe that's a good idea I'll write that one down so a mitt of course um he's always been really fond of your philosophical background he asks he says quote you have a background in philosophy with a focus on neoclassical social theory I don't know what that is but I always wondered if that philosophy influenced how you rampound during the early years do you think your background in philosophy influenced the direction of the company to have a singular focus on providing value over just selling for the sake of selling by the way thank you a mitt and uh and you know I would say you could conversely ask is your was your interest in philosophy the reason why you were able to kind of weather the storm and stick with us um I I mean there's a lot like there's I think one of the overlooked things about you know we we we live in a world where most people doing intellectual endeavors are actually trying to sell us a pagan religion which doesn't work so then we assume that the intellectual endeavor is not valuable but it's not true and uh and if and so that there are many aspects that have really first of all serious intellectuals are are not as into fads as people think so like being able to reject just just the intellectual and emotional ability to not be mimetic meaning not just copy and compete which is really how almost every software company that you know Wall Street we look we pound here doesn't we don't we focus on our own business but obviously it's kind of obvious Wall Street was very much in love with a series of companies that essentially were mimetic which is like we're gonna do which already been done but slightly different and our CEOs slightly better or much better at selling it and we're gonna go long on them and short on pound here and so I think so then for me it's like but one of the reasons that our company was and is and still very much underappreciated is um we are building for like you know we we are reducing first of all philosophically things to the odd state so what odd a company do is actually crazy powerful like because that's very different than what does a company do which is largely mimetic and then meaning it's just it's just a commodity it's like a slightly better commodity uh sold at a probably inflated price because it's underwritten by bankers and everyone kind of makes money so then so that's kind of point one point two I would say um you know it's it's it's like might the my somewhat odd sounding dissertations odd sounding because it doesn't really translate into English but in in Germans kind of a not that unstanter thing to to study uh but the the Germanic element of like this rigor and asking like you know at what level of abstraction is an answer true like is it is it true at this level or is it true at that level and and how does it reverberate and if you look at our products uh especially where it's obvious would be like um but you really all of them but like PGA it's like we didn't solve the problem of stopping terrorism we solved the problem of augmenting civil liberties while stopping terrorism which is already if you go down five six layers and you say well you not only have to build a product that the country would adopt you have to build a product a country ought to adopt and that required three years of me getting yelled at by investors like where's my fucking revenue right and it was like no we're gonna go very very deep on this and and actually then we made a dendoms that you know if you look back at what we're now doing with LLMs we were we were trying to accomplish a lot of what is done with LLMs and with our ontology if it's going to be not fake um with integrating NLP into the product because Intel services need that and then the whole idea for deployed engineers was to actually increase the aperture of the product offering beyond what the product yourself could do so both specialization then you have like you know contradiction between the specialization people even today and this is partly because people doing finance and establishment things have been trained as in positivist tradition so they want complete non-contradictory statements so they want product or services so the fact that we were like we're going to expand the aperture of the product by providing services and productize those services at the highest level of abstraction making dominant products in the world it seems like an obvious thing that you ought to do they still don't believe it or understand it at all yeah last I know you want to push me on them or just extend but like on the positivist versus ontological I do think one of the reasons why it's very hard for kind of classically trained why have non-crashically trained exceedingly smart intellectually aggressive and high integrity non-trained often non elite trained individuals have such a high hit rate in understanding pound you whether you invested or not but understanding and then putting their money into pound here and why have the classic conversely the classically trained elite often elite educated experts not only are they wrong but they're still committed to being wrong I mean you can go online now and see people have been wrong for three years wrong for five years they're just like you it's like they're just committed to being stupid but but but they're actually not committed to being stupid even though it really does feel that way they're committed to a world where they they are everything they think cannot be wrong and part of the reason they are so committed to it is they they they don't have the right philosophical precivity at we hand or they're not viewing it tablo rasa like you know the people who plays the questions are just like well does the product work what does the product do does it create value I would say LLMs in ontology of pound here create value and kind of what philosophical terms would be called autocratic and like or it's more like classically a Germanic philology which is the system is so powerful that it reverberates you can't look at the reverberations which would be the discounted free cash flow if you don't understand the motor that's creating them they want to approximate the motor by looking at a DCF model by the way with enormous bigotry because if they like they didn't like me not so you see these people like I don't like carp therefore my DCF model sucks but but the core problem is not they're hatred for me or pound here and their inability to see the world as it is which is a problem probably all throughout their life I mean God knows who these people are married to but but but it's also it's actually a philosophical problem because like if LLMs powered by pound here are anything even remotely like what the clients are saying they are if they produce numbers anything like what we're producing when we're going to market in this still a very very non-standard arguably non-optimal way all across the world where 13% of our business is growing 4% and it's not going to change even though I would love really like Europe to wake up and but they can't perceive it because you have to look at what is how valuable is the product what does the product do what value does it create can you assign quantitative value to that value and if you do that you can have a much more different not just looking at pound here looking at every aspect of your life is there a concept of beauty does the product work how well does it work is it disruptive does it create a situation for disruption in the world as it is now not as it was in the past and that that that's why philosophically you know and the and I think the temperamental bigotry that you see among many of these experts which at this point really has to be called like entrenched forms of ignorance because they still say stupid things like is like these are people but but but it's really downstream from a philosophical training that is positive it's positive from a positivistic and no longer a completely relevant set of assumptions and you are much much better and much more accurate starting from the beginning and working up and then you know you want to see the rest of assumptions by the book so that actually kind of feeds into another good question that Luke Kabash asks so you know pound here now say to say established software company but right in the beginning yeah I don't like that establishment thing exactly you know but in the context of 20 years ago in this infancy you talked about you had these investors complaining about where's my money you had VCs rejecting you left and right you probably had family and other folks saying this or that friends being like what is he doing how were you able to stay true to in the face of such adversity for so many years the company's vision and rhetoric has been remarkably consistent how did how do you say what is the most well there are a lot of questions and that's these are very strong questions it's it's you know one of the most remarkable things about pound here honestly is if you go back to any part of pound here in the last I don't know since inception and you read what we're saying we're saying the same thing now compare that to many others it's like every day is a new story and it's like but they'll put the old story they didn't mean it but the new story they do so it's uh it's um you know it's very hard I look I think at the end of the day like it's just I was born so far outside the norm biographically I tend to over index on the dyslexia it's like I was very it's like almost I'm almost uncomfortable now when I go in rooms and people are like hey I'd like to hear your thoughts like my thoughts like I mean in the past people would like be like you know it was but but they really want to hear them in the past it was like could you talk quickly because this is kind of pretty scary and uh I'm getting away from you quickly um but I think I don't know you know there was a famous fine answer that said you know um you know you don't ask a bee what pollinates like I think like I think I've come to view myself it's like it's like a form of artistry I'm like a bee pollinating my thing I don't know if a bee feels like they're an outsider when they're following this is where they're picking a different flower that they like more I'm pretty happy doing my pollination dance uh I kind of find it weird when people like think I'm part of the establishment till I open my mouth and then it's so funny like I'll go to these fancy meetings and I'll like start talking like wait a minute you're you're you're you're as freaky in private like basically they don't put it that way they're like wait wait I thought that was some kind of act like well I don't know because you didn't you wouldn't pick the seat next to me but uh you know um but you know I look but the one thing I would say that I think is slightly misunderstood often is I do listen very very carefully exceedingly carefully to what people say and again to this philosophical trench to uh thing it's not what they say I make and I went I try to get everyone a pound here to do the same thing I steal man at like times 50 so it's like what did they say what is true what could be true about what they're saying if they were actually saying what they mean what if you took away the things that I think are stupid and then made those things that are not stupid into a real argument is this argument uh that they're making related to past or present experience are they making the argument because you know I'm now important or they making the argument because they want to show that they're intelligent what is the basis for the reason they're making the argument um do they have actual experience in what they're saying not taught experience but real experience and is there something I can glean even from the stupidest argument you'll ever hear like for example I it's really hard to read dissertation because you have to find something that's never been said and then say it and I was struggling with an example to work on and and obviously not making news but this person who I think is and it just not very act talented gave me an idea of something to read and it really saved me it's like so you could you know the village idiot like you know you can learn from them I mean like I even listen to analysts to the point where I discovered that they're complete raving bigots or you know like so like steel manning things uh so it is like the the the real thing is steel manning it but no matter how many people say things and no matter how many people believe it I still will not change until I believe it and uh and that's a different thing because like what you'll often find is like people think I'm running around the world ignoring everything or that's the kind of the thing because you know so much of what we've been taught about just software software development how to fight wars I mean you know like all these things it's just obviously blatantly not true and has nothing to do with how things work on the ground like completely nothing to do with like anything that actually works on the ground it's really crazy talking to like you know essentially armchair anthropologist you know about like things they claim to be experts at in all aspects of life but you know it's it's it's actually you know and what we try to do a pout here is you know make the nugget that could be true into a really really solid nugget and then take that apart so uh and then if man actually works yeah I'm down for listening and changing in this company you know one of the reasons it works so well is we can change on a dime especially we have product leverage and people leverage it's all built to change like and people inside this like you know a pout here of now is not anything like pout here a year ago and like we embrace that um and uh but it's like but it cannot be that you know everyone like everyone thinks you know these famous statements don't you think x well that that's like a recipe for like suicide in death for your your institution your personal life your country it just like don't you think x is like just like you might as well just start slicing the artery yeah next question actually we're going to bring in a guest a guest moderator because I can't speak German so this comes from Yon in Germany um and we have a special moderator who will read it the personality between German and American and the other one that can German from the American learning and what's American from the German okay the Germans in americans are by the way we don't this is the book we don't you know just you buy it it's it's a great it's actually not so bad that the publishers are hounding me uh by uh um it's uh uh uh some people think it's very impressive people tell you it's great and it's actually pretty it's very well written it's it's a you joy but so this is um uh actually wants something to spin but unfortunately I've been dishonored there's nothing really here it's spinnable but um uh yeah this this is not very good for spinning i mean if you mess it up though you know people don't forget yeah now this is terrible for spinning yeah I want I don't you've heard something heavier you're batting perfect you're batting once for now okay okay so any case um the question is what what congierman's learned from americans and americans can learn from german german so well i mean first of all the tech AI revolution is in america so the first thing you can learn from americans is get over here if you're in tech and you're listening remotely in tech want to be in tech want to invest in tech want to understand tech you got to come here now whether you have to stay here maybe you can learn it's like i don't know but you this is where the revolution is um and it is an expression in in german this is where the music is being played uh if you're german you understand the power of that like you've got so the the most important thing you can do if german is like if you're german is like and and the hard part about being german uh the tech scene in germany is you know the germany pre-world were two was the tech scene was the arching was the cultural scene was the the physics scene the military technology scene um the literature scene the debauchery scene if that was interesting for you i mean the whole thing was there so like um and for historical reasons that are obvious if it's not um and so you do not like there's a there's a sense in the world now you're going to hear this in germany just like you hear in the democratic party that the pendulum will swing back it's very unlikely actually that that that was historically what happened like germany economy sucked the Gerhard Truder came in what some people like him some of the harem not don't agree with him on certain things obviously but like he completely got the economy to work and then you assume that somebody's going to come in now and just but you know if you look at palantir it's growing over 10x faster in america than in continental europe and i think the combination of that kind of flexibility adoption in tech and uh actual output power of the tech means almost all these pendulum swing the arc of history things if you're saying them thinking them you're like the guy at the at the poker table doesn't think you're the mark so the what you really because then there's a question of how you learn you learn by going to the place where people who are the best in the world are doing it that place is america uh you should just either move here come here come here for as long as possible um you know in my circles in in europe america's being occasionally maligned don't listen to that that's like people telling you your school is working when it you're just learning propagand propagand it's believe that at your own expense and you will be very unhappy what america can uh and then the other thing germany can learn from america is look it the concept of patriotism is is obviously complicated given germans germany's history but you cannot run you cannot run an organization of any kind of any scale without pride and actually pride in germ in the term like you can't even really say that in germany now uh maybe in austria she's austrian for those who are germany you'll know that uh an austria switch from leesonstein that's a little different like of course it's you know it kind of pure american style pride may be a little hard but like no pride um uh and and i think germany's going to have to figure that out because like the current situation is like completely like you have 25% of germany completely unwilling to address the consequences of a immigration disaster you have no tech scene and you have energy crisis this is not going to end well so you have to be honest about that by the way that's something germans can learn from germans elish kite you know oh just a man then what americans can learn from germans is like you know i mean this company has a huge Germanic element i mean we work a we work on um mandates so alf traiga uh the the whole going five wise like going deep the steel manning uh the kind of pushing responsibility edge which is not with how people think of germany and in some cases isn't but that's how the parts of the germ military fought um the general way in which we're a very high honesty culture inside very high integrity we have no interest in lying corruption we we're not even good at that stuff which is very very germane like you know we're actually you know yeah i mean you know we're not like you we're not actually that great at like the marketing sales thing despite what you know people who've never looked at our product think they're like it's all but it is but and that's crazy germanic we're not super good at the politics people who come here who are primarily political and low substance don't do well we don't hire those people we're an engineering org so that when you're learning from palatir you are learning from parts of it are germanic industrial and intellectual culture as it existed when germany was dominant not as it exists now and um and one of the things i find quite painful actually about germany uh which is you know i've lived a lot of my life there lots of friends care about i view myself as like germanic is you know what company should germany be learning from this is obvious palatir but like you have complete idiots blocking our product like terror attacks and somehow they can't buy pg which we don't even really make real money on we're doing it to like better the world it's like like and then you have a company that started from nothing that is the dominant company in multiple areas and in an area no one understands really which is like a i production where a i actually is not a jargon word is not a science perfect but needs to demonstrable results they should be like european companies especially germany should be parked over here like why does it take the OGs in america to write down every word and learn from us and like who's learning from us in germany it's it's completely nuts and you know what and then you kind of give up it's like well you know it's like yeah they don't want to listen you know it's like it's like yeah it's how many times can you can you sit there while your professor says the dumbest things ever and be like oh that's so interesting so eventually just walk out and like as big you can't help them yeah we have time for one more question all right all right this question comes from another OG tom dasch um yet another OG i feel like yeah i feel i feel very special today yeah well you know the OGs ask really good questions and uh tom asks a century from now when people look back at palanter's impact what do you hope will be its defining legacy that the superior art of the west was in it it it it put into software production and uh made western countries especially america healthier wealthier stronger fairer more meritocratic and scared every enemy of these countries to the point where they woke up every morning and wrote on their front window and sent a wrote on x we are not actually your enemy we are your friend even if they're not and please do not randomly take out our leaders just because we thought that we might be plotting things against you great and that people look back and say yeah palanter played a huge role in both the software production and the people uh and by the way then people like point and like oh isn't that the OG a palanter living in that mansion yeah that would be great too and then any final any final thoughts on you got the book coming out in a few days anything that you want people to really focus on take away from the book uh you know i think for most people in this call it's like look this is the intellectual background that you didn't need for to figure out things that but it might be helpful in in like some planting some botch you already or like all string some botch you already have um and then you know i don't know let me know what you think yeah well um dr. carp thank you for your time thank you for everyone or two everyone that's watching we really appreciate your support and uh maybe we'll do one of these again soon hope so great care
