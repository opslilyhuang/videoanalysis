Good evening everyone. Thanks for having me here tonight. So excited to be here in this amazing venue. Thank you Alex for putting all of this together. Now let's set the stage of what healthcare is at least for Tampa general. We are a 4.5 billion dollar organization in West Central Florida. So lots of great revenue but we operate in the hospital at around a 1 to a 1.5 percent margin. So if we have a 2 percent Medicare cut this year, guess what happens when Medicare is about 40% of our payer base. Every year the government has reductions on what they're reimbursing healthcare. Insurance companies are finding cruel and unusual ways to pay us less money. Labor is going up and with tariffs, supplies and equipment is going up. So the only way that we can work ourself out of this situation is to innovate. And I'll kind of ask a question out to the audience whether the two last industries to innovate. I'll give you one is healthcare. And the second is education. The teacher will get up in front of a classroom and teach one way but each student may learn in a different way and there's no way to customize how you're going to teach a student and I translate the same thing over to medicine. There's no way that you could take two diabetic patients with the same numbers and treat them exactly the same way. So the mantra of pathway-based care is interesting and I think it's evidence-based but at the same point we need to find a way to customize care for our patients and that's what I'm going to show you later today. So what we have here are the three big pillars that we look at within our health system. We're trying to find a way to weave together clinical operation side, operational side and finance because the finance is so important to us and the connective tissue that we use through all of that. Today we're going to focus in on the care navigation administrative view and take you through a patient journey of a patient by the name of Jane that unfortunately got admitted to the ICU. Now if you've ever been in a hospital before you realize that you give total control away, right? That's the number one thing you lose in a hospital and so what you're seeing now is a life feed. Think about it almost like an X feed for a physician so as things are happening throughout the hospital you're getting notifications of what's going on. The information is coming to find you versus me having to go back into our EMR and check on data. So Jane's had a CT of her chest, a CAT scan, she's had blood cultures, she's diagnosed with sepsis. Oh by the way we use a volunteer algorithm to pick sepsis up earlier and get a patient on a treatment pathway. What is its result in is a 68% reduction in 48% power mortality. So within two days does this patient still with us or not? In the last two years that's resulted in 700 additional patients being able to leave the hospital versus how we operated before. Hospitals around the country get sepsis right about 20 to 30% of the time. So how would you like to be a patient walking into that scenario? So in this example we're actually walking through where a pulmonology clearance is given, ID clearance is given. The patient meets downgrade criteria out of the ICU because they've responded well to the antibiotics. We know that by the feed over on the side and the patient's getting ready to move on to the next stage of the care. You have an AIP reader that's looking over the notes and actually suggesting the next best pathway which is the downgrade the patient from the ICU. As we start moving on we'll make the recommendation that now the patient can be downgraded out of the ICU but we have a problem here because now the patient still needs IV antibiotics and that IV antibiotic course is going to be an additional four days in the hospital outside of the ICU. So it adds an additional four days to our length of stay taking a bet away from another patient. Luckily we have AIP reading the chart and recommending hospital at home. So what that is is the ability to take the hospital-based care and actually take it out and mobilize it to the patient's home and get the patient moving out of the hospital. So it's running an eligibility in the background that says consider hospital at home. So as a physician I don't need to remember that this patient live close enough to the hospital. What is their payer because only certain payers cover hospital at home at this point in time and then again being able to enroll that patient into the hospital at home program easily. So I can go ahead and look at my criteria. I can see my milestones have been met for IV antibiotics, downgrade out of the ICU, where the patient lives, what their payer is and I'm moving on to the next step which is getting this patient enrolled into the hospital at home program. So as that happens you'll see AIP is helping out create the referral order get that placed out to that team so they can get ready to enroll that patient next into the into the system. As you move on here this gives the patient view of the pain of all the little little things that happen during admission. A lab result, an imaging result, diagnostics, infusions, nursing orders, procedure and imagine being able the dream is if we reach such a high level of automation could we get to the point where we have a digital screen at the foot of the bed actually delivering a message to the patient saying between the hours of 9 and 10 your physician will be by to round. Between the hours of 11 to 12 you're going to get a CAT scan the result will be back in the afternoon and your physician will be back to discuss the results. First is sitting in the bed and looking at this clock that I'm looking at right now it's like the 24 o'clock second by second drifting away as you're sitting in the bed wondering what's going to happen to be next. Now the most exciting piece for this is this is underway right now we're about halfway through the build the proof of concept of all the pieces that got us to where we are right now have all been successful but this is just such a small slice of the patient care journey from an inpatient perspective. The dream of this is being able to apply it outside the walls of the hospital. So how can I take a breast cancer patient that's going to need an MRI a PET scan a port radiation oncology consult a chair time in chemotherapy and a surgical consult and be able to plan around the patient's life that's a mom she maybe has to pick up her kids we don't ask her like hey what are you doing we say oh we have an appointment at 2 30 and in her head she's thinking that's the time I need to pick up my kids who's going to pick up my kids if I have to come and get a treatment. So really being able to take this operational concept the clinical flow and get a patient from okay we're unfortunately diagnosing you with a cancer to the point where I have you in a treatment pathway in a shorter period of time resulting in hopefully a better outcome and a happier patient. It's been such a pleasure to share a little bit about our healthcare journey at Tampa General with you all tonight. Big thanks to David you David is our palantir FDSC who really helps us with all of our engineering activities and it's such a big part as Alex talked about that person that gets to know your organization is like nothing else and it becomes more of a friendship versus a vendor client relationship. So thanks again and it's a great time talking to you tonight.
