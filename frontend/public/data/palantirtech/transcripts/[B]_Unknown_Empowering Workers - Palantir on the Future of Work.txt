TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm the Vanessa. I'm normally on the line and I'm an electric car in there. Now, at the moment, I'm at the OOSV team for about a half a year. That means I'm working the rest, which will stay in line and move me in the whole hall. I've been on my own for about two years now. I have to leave my foot in Paris. After four weeks, I didn't have any fun at home. Then I got my boss and told him, you don't have anything to do with me. But I still have my foot in my pocket. He said, come on, we're here. We've already found something. I have an idea and you can work on the computer. Vanessa was one of my team members. When it comes to doing something, they can support us. We said, we could probably use a computer to use a computer. This makes it a real deal. How often does it come before, how much work it takes to get the results? My boss didn't come to me and I said, we've got different decisions. I took these things and then I've searched for information. I wrote a program where you can fill this information. At the end of the day, you've seen that you always have the decisions when you're on the computer. In which time you can enter. And then you can write a message and write these things on the computer. Vanessa has the right to work on the computer. She knows exactly the support and knows all these different forms of support. I have information about where my flight is. What tasks were worked on and why were they open? When can I work on these tasks? From which reasons are there tasks that are still open? For me, it's a lot of work. We have a lot of work on the line. I have to run a lot more. I have a lot of work to do. I've learned to work in such fields. It's relatively easy to help yourself. When you need some information, it's relatively easy to build something together. And then you have your own information.
