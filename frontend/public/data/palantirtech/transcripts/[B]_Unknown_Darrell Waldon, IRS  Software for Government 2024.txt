TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We have the really difficult task of going after lunch, talking about taxes. After you just saw the cool technology in the Air Force, but I'm Darryl Walden. I'm the executive director of Advanced Analytics and Innovation in IRSCI. So we are, how many people, let me start. How many people knew IRS had a criminal division? Wow, I am impressed. Well, I work for IRS Criminal Investigation and I've been with the agency now for about 18 years. I started as a special agent in the Atlanta Field Office and have been all over since. And now I have the extreme pleasure and task of running our Advanced Analytics and Innovation Department. So a little bit about the IRS. The IRS, you guys all know, we're here to collect taxes, right? We collect about 97% of the countries revenue. And you could see in 2020, it was about $3.5 trillion. And 240 million tax returns were processed by the IRS. IRS Criminal Investigation. What we are here to do is to investigate criminal violations of the internal or overdue code as well as other financial crimes. And so some of those other financial crimes could be money laundering, terrorism, financing, narcotics trafficking, so on and so forth. We have approximately 3,000 employees, 2,000 of which are special agents and we have about 900 professional staff. In fiscal year 21 and I've gotten updated numbers, we've identified probably about $6 billion in fraud. And that's really important because we're able to do that now because of the use of summative technology that we've deployed, which includes Palantir. In other financial crimes, you guys all familiar with what happened in about 2021, the pandemic, COVID, right? And with COVID and all the programs that were there to assess the tax payment public, people took advantage of those, right? Anytime that there's a program that's going to assess the tax payment public and it involves any type of credit, we're going to see some sort of tax fraud associated with that. So that number jumped from $8 billion to about $25 billion in fraud identified. Criminal investigation has one of the highest conviction rates and all of law enforcement. Right now we're at about 90.4%, which is absolutely one of the highest. So what that means is if IRS criminal investigation comes the knocks on your door and you're subject to 9 times out of 10, you're going to go to jail. And so we have a pretty good conviction rate, it's something that we're all very proud of. This is some of the sources of our investigation and the reason why I wanted to highlight this slide was because 13% of our investigation comes from a Finson data, which is suspicious activity reports, CTRs, 8300, so on and so forth. And that's really important for my talk here today because panel and tier enabled us to review that data a lot more quickly than we were able to do otherwise. Again, some of these are just some of the tax crimes that we investigated or some of the crimes that we investigated. We initiate about 2,500 investigations each year. We recommend prosecution on about 2,000 of those. And again, we have about the highest conviction rate in the country. 1,200 of those people end up being sentenced each year. So my division, Evisthen Analytics and Innovation, Overseas 6 sections. I have about 200 employees, special agents and investigative analysts, which is very unique for us. We have the applied analytics division. We have data management of governance. We have innovation as well as the nationally coordinated investigative unit, which utilizes big data with the help of Palantir to identify large cases of some of the most egregious, non-compliance indicators for us to develop investigations that get up to the fill. Refund fraud and investigative services is really important and was integral to our partnership with Palantir. And it's really how we got the partnership started. So I'll talk a little bit about them here in a minute. Sistubes, operation and support really just supports all the work that we do. So our mission is to empower C.I. employees to make data-driven decisions, to make organization impact their collaboration, transparency, and communication. So this is our training portal, the very first, not training portal, the early innovation of our partnership with LCA Palantir. This is what it looked like when they decided to build this thing out in 2015. 2015 was really important and transformative for the IRS because if anybody is aware, we went through what was a really problematic area with identity theft, where we saw the proliferation of identity theft, where organized criminals were utilizing tax refund fraud to promote their criminal activity. And so it was proliferating. It was huge. It was really tough for us to keep up. And the way in which we did our work back then, we had to reputate a request to an individual who had to go research each and every tax return. Print that information out. Somebody had to comb through all those pieces of paper to identify people that we thought were responsible for this crime. Even though we had massive amounts of data, we had IP addresses, we had email addresses, we had addresses, we had phone numbers, we had banking information, but we could not analyze that information at all because we were still doing it very manually. And so our partnership with Palantir was kicked off with that in mind. And we first began to work with what we call refund fraud and investigative services because that's where we saw one of our greatest threats. This is what it looked like from the start. It was very basic for us, right? You know, on the left hand side, you got a bunch of tax return information that our analysts knew how to study and analyze and hopefully make connections. On the right hand side kind of shows you the linkages that were developed based on all the data that we had available to us. We were able to link the fits in information that I talked about earlier with the 1040 information, which allowed us to identify networks of criminals real time that we were not able to identify before. So that was the original sort of kickoff of how we were using Palantir. One of the things that I didn't mention and wanted a previous slide, we only had 32 sources of data in there. And I don't know what it is now, but it's massive amounts of data. We did not behave, it got to a inflection point, which was about 2019 to 2021. And as I stated before, that's kind of when COVID kicked off. And we learned a great bit about the identity theft time where we knew we had software available to us that would allow us to analyze real threats real time and make connections that we ordinarily would not be able to make. Additionally, we were at a point where we were losing a lot of our employees. So we wanted to capture and sort of modernize some of our processes so that we could make our work that much more efficient for our agents. So how do we use this software, right? Since then, we've doubled down to Palantir. Our investments continue to grow. And we're continually evolving our needs and we're identifying and developing additional workflows. Our deconfliction efforts became really, really, really important. And CI, we had a big problem. We were not able to tell who was out doing what. So if I would have interviewed Derriwald and as a witness in one of my investigations, my counterpart in New York had no idea that I had this information that might be helpful to his investigation who he's now investigating Derriwald at four tax crimes. Palantir helped us solve that problem because we were able to deconflick based on an other database that we had in-house along with some of the documents that are generated during the investigative process. We're increasing our efficiencies in our everyday workflows. Again, one of the things that I'll talk about here a little bit later is the platform allows us to manage the workflow that we were traditionally managing by spreadsheets up until 68 months ago. And not only that, Palantir opened its systems to where we could start to developing those workflow apps ourselves. So we put the technology in the hands of individuals that we work with that know the work the best to say, this is what I want to see. And the great thing about that is we've got great partnerships here with Palantir where we could send those employees to the office here and they worked shoulder to shoulder with Palantir employees and show them this low-code way of developing the tools that they need to better do their jobs. Also we've gone, what did it, so fraud is always evolving. The bad guys are always thinking about another way to defraud whether it's the government, human beings, you name it, corporations, they're always thinking about it. And one of the things we have now with Palantir is a blueprint that we could utilize because we've learned from COVID, we learned from identity theft that when there's an emerging threat, there are things that we could put in place that will allow us to make connections faster than we ever did. With COVID, one of the things we did was ingest the data from SBA. We got all the information about the PPP loans and started to compare that information to tax returns so we could see what was real and what wasn't real and allowed us to protect revenue as well. Something that we would not have been able to do had we not had that information at our fingertips. So I talked a little bit about COVID fraud, some of our big challenges to keep us up at tonight. Digital assets, digital assets as we know are anonymized. People hide behind virtual currency, they hide their wealth and other legal activities that are ongoing. Well with Palantir and because certain information is captured, we're able to make linkages that we weren't able to do before on IP addresses, email addresses, so on and so forth. The dark web, it's going to continue to be a problem for us. So what's upcoming and again, Palantir is allowing us to prepare for us to green credit. Everybody is familiar with the IRA and if you bought a Tesla, you're going to be able to take a credit that's refundable to you on your tax return as a matter of promoting green energy. So what my team is now able to do is think about the operational efficiencies that Palantir created and start to develop a plan for attacking this crime even before we start to release the credits. We are already talking about the data needs that we need. We're talking about who needs access to the information and how we're going to deploy that technology to the individual agents and analysts in the field so that they could be at the forefront of this criminal activity when we know it's going to kick off. And again, we wouldn't have been able to do that if we didn't have a robust system in place. And so we are already talking with Palantir about the ingestion needs. We're talking with our technology department about the ingestion needs of data. One of the other things that we're doing, we're already starting to build out queries that we'll be able to publish in a query library that other agents who don't aren't extremely technical don't need to know a lot of the technicalities behind developing these queries can pull off a shelf, deploy it, maybe make a few changes depending on the area of responsibility and identify leads real time with regard to who's claiming these credits and whether or not they're fraudulent or not. So going back to COVID fraud, we built a COVID lead portal with the assistance of Palantir and probably a couple of months, which was really important because we were able to stop the proliferation and we'll not stop. We didn't stop it, but we put a huge dent in the proliferation of COVID fraud. It was really just born out of experience and people wanting to do the right thing by ensuring that people weren't abused in these credits. It was the partnership. This is what that lead portal ended up looking like for us. And basically what that is showing is the amount of PPP loans that people were applying for, but also the amount that was issued. But the other side of the portal, which it's not up here, I'm sorry, but the other side of it is we were able to connect the tax data with the PPP data to say, okay, this person applied for $20 million in COVID loans, their business just started last year. They have no W2 zone file. They've never filed a 941. It's just really a legitimate PPP loan application, probably not. And so what that allowed us to do is work with our civil counterparts to stop those refunds from going out. But it also let us know who was behind this illegal activity. And not only that, they were working in networks. And with the assistance of Pell and Tear, we were able to see this is one of the dashboards created, but we were able to see these networks on the dashboard. What else it did because obviously Congress was very interested in what IRS was doing to fight COVID fraud. We were able to run reports in ways in which we were not able to run before. All because of an employee, not leadership, thought about this, they knew the technology, and they were able to walk us through this. That just shows how impactful this technology was and how transformational it's truly been for us. And as I stated before, this is our blueprint. So whenever I'm in meetings and I'm thinking about I'm hearing that there are going to be new credits involved or the child tax credits going to increase, I'm thinking how do we get the information that we need in our agents hands and we start to build this sort of thing out. So that just talks about the readiness of IRS. IRS, we're doing a lot with this. One of the other things, I'm really excited about the work that the agents are doing because they come up with very unique ideas. I sat in the field office of the Washington DC. One of the largest field offices in the country, I was the sack. What I wanted to know was what kind of work was in Roa, not Virginia, which was one of my areas of responsibility. I didn't really know. Well, there was an organization in IRS that built a tool that's called Halo, worked with our lovely partners here. And what that does, it allows me to look at my area of responsibility on a map and say how many cases are in the Roa and Oak area? How many investigations have been worked in that area over the past five years? Okay, we have the ability to hire 10 people. Do I really want to put them in Roa and Oak? Or do I want to put them in Northern Virginia where I'm seeing a proliferation of LLCs and things like that are being created and tax liabilities are dropping. I am talking with my leadership and saying, I think I have more work in, and in Roa, Northern Virginia didn't I do in Roa and Oak Virginia. So it allows us also to do a targeted approach of recruiting and staffing. And we're able to do this across the nation, which again, was something that we couldn't do. We had the data, but we had no way to do this very quickly. And this is updated daily. So as we're out recruiting special agents, we're able to focus our efforts now in ways in which we weren't able to focus before. So the nationally coordinated investigative unit is one of the units that I oversee. But they're responsible for is really taking large initiatives and identifying criminal investigations using big data for our people in the field office. Again, they were tracking their work of about 30, 40 employees via spreadsheet. So I get a lead. I'm starting to develop it as an analyst. My manager has no insight into what that work entails and where it is in the process. And unless they go up and come up to me and ask me about this. Well, one of the analysts in the NCIU thought there has to be a way for us to develop or track the work that we're doing. Again, she came here and worked with Palantir and developed what you see now. It's one of our process flows, which allows us to see what work is being done by each individual analyst, the capacity that they might have, and tracking that all the way to the field office, and we're able to see the status, whether or not the field accepted it, and if not wide, so that we're able to refocus our resources and obviously skill up where we need to skill up to make sure that those leads are better leads. So this is an example of the workflow there. You could see that we called it a Tier 1 referral and it was pending the initial meeting. That was not something we would know other than somebody keying this in on a spreadsheet, which we really didn't keep up very well. So I'm very excited about this workflow, but the other thing that I want to talk about with regard to workflow, as I'm sitting in meetings with my colleagues and some of my other leaders that report to me who are telling me that they have a workflow process problem, I'm kicking them to one of my employees, Nicole, who built this project and saying you need to really talk with her to see how you can leverage Palantir to understand the work that's going on in your area. One of the things that really excites me, but scares me, is AI. It scares me from the perspective of we know AI is going to be used to try to exploit IRS systems, to trick us to releasing money that there are otherwise not entitled to. But I'm excited about it because it's going to allow opportunities for efficiency and I can tell you we're not anywhere close to building what the Air Force has built, but what Palantir we're going to be working and talking about ways that we can leverage to AI capabilities within the software. One of the things that we're going to be doing and talking about is document review. Document review from the perspective of being proactive and highlighting some of the reports and fence in that tells us that there might be suspicious activity that we want to look into. Another thing is whenever we go out and make a contact with the public, we write some sort of memorandum, but we have no idea what's in those memorandums. What we're wanting to do is obviously upload all of those M.O.I.'s, M.O.X.'s is what we're calling them, into Palantir and deploy some sort of AI to start to connect individuals, de-conflict, and see what we can learn from all the things that are going on in the field. So I'm really excited about that. We just want to be able to review data a lot more efficiently and I believe AI is going to really help us do that. As I tell my team the possibilities are endless and I'm really excited for the future there. In close, Palantir has been a phenomenal partner for us. I could not be more grateful for their commitment to innovation and enhancing their systems and growing with us. We've been tremendously happy with them and I really, really, really look forward to seeing what we could do in the future. As I state to my employees, together we'll grow and together we'll be that much better off. So I'll pause there and see if anybody has any questions. Sorry, I don't have all the cool stuff like Air Force. Yes, ma'am. As you develop these different tools, it seems like you have quite a large range of ways of identifying if there's a potential issue fraud, to what extent of those human-based design and algorithms versus a computer? How do you develop that tool? So we developed the tools knowing that we are ways are going to have to have it sort of human touch to the work that is done. But what we're looking at primarily now is what can we automate in terms of processes to allow us to analyze the data a lot more efficiently than we were before? Making connections, identifying networks, but it's always going to take a human that's going to have to go in and review the data to determine what the computer is spitting down and telling us is a problem is really a problem. And that's going to allow us to also go back and train the models to say, okay, maybe this isn't a problem in this community because of X. So we're always going to have that human interaction, that human workflow sort of feedback loop so that we can make the technology a little bit more smarter to help us be a little bit more efficient. I don't know if that answers your question. Any other questions? Come on guys, not interested in taxes? Yes, ma'am. I have a selfish question. Oh, thank you. I was saying I have a selfish question. So you obviously are on the criminal side and targeting the bad actors for those of us that do our best to follow all of the rules, pulling all of the different information together that we have to then submit for our tax returns is incredibly complicated and I could see something like this being a value to the taxpayer to simplify the process as well. Do you know if there's anything happening on the other side of the coin? So there are, that's a very good question. On going efforts and talks about allowing taxpayers to interact with the IRS in a way in which you interact with your bank. You could go online and see what mortgage interests you paid, so on and so forth. What we want you to be able to do is go into your account and see all the tax filings that have come into the IRS so that you can more accurately prepare your return because I like you start getting those mail links probably in January. That probably will get the last one until when I check my mail on April 10th. And so I'm like pulling everything together at the last minute, making sure that I report everything that I'm supposed to report. And we know that's a burden and so we're constantly talking at the IRS about ways that we can reduce that burden and one of the things is, and I forget the technical name that they're calling it, but allowing you to log into a portal to see what filings should be a part of your filing and upcoming, you know, for that particular tax season. It's not around the corner but we are working on it because we do realize I'm incredibly difficult that could be. So you talked about machine learning models. As AI is being adopted by IRS, what is the feedback loop in the sense as bad guys are using systems to, you know, say apply for COVID loans and things like that. And then as tax code is changing, what is the feedback cycle or how quickly those machine learning models are being developed by IRS? So I can't necessarily comment on terms of the quickness, but we are very aware of the need for there to be a feedback loop. And we are creating opportunities for the different organizations and employees within the IRS to provide those loops. I can tell you what we're doing in CI, but not for larger IRS, which is far more complicated to what we have going on. You're creating an AI task force to sort of identify all of those sort of challenges that are going to come along with deploying AI. How do we ensure that we are training the models on good data? How are we getting all the data in one spot for the models to be trained on? What kind of professionals we need to help us with this technology and how are we going to incorporate the feedback and how are we going to employ, and form our employees about the different loops and so on and so forth about how the technology works. But very early on on a criminal investigation side of things in terms of utilizing AI, but it's something that we're thinking about and we're working with our employees to help us inform policies and procedures as we move forward into this technology. All right, thanks everybody.
