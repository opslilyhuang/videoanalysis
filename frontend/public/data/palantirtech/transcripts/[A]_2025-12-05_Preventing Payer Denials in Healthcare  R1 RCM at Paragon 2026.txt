Hey everybody, I'm Steve. This is John. We're from R1 and it was very nice of Peter to tee up earlier the challenge that health systems have, especially from a margin perspective. Stepping back even further, you know, in the US, the health systems spend $740 billion across all the systems just to collect the reimbursement that they're owed for the care they provide patients. That's an office and administrative burden. It's manual processes, it's paperwork, it's phone calls, it's handing off work from team to team. And that can cost almost 4% of the revenue that they pull in compared to other industries. It's one of the highest percentages that there is. So we at R1, we're in the middle of this problem. We serve health systems. We have over 500 clients. We serve 95 at the top 100 health systems and help them to address this problem. We've been doing this for 20 years. For eight of those clients, we run their entire revenue cycle. For the rest of those clients, we provide them on average about four solutions. And over those 20 years, we've developed a tremendous amount of intelligence, best practice processes, rules, engines. And with the AI revolution that's happening at the beginning of this year, we decided we need to take a fundamentally different approach. And we've been embedding that intelligence in what we call a revenue operating system. We call it FaroS. The revenue operating system is aimed at comprehensively automating complex processes to accelerate reimbursement and to make it as accurate as possible. And importantly, it's an interconnected system that is aimed at not just resolving problems but preventing them from the first place. So Denials represent a huge administrative burden in health care. We know at R1 that 9% of claims will be first passed denied. After weeks of administrative back and forth, phone calls, gathering evidence, clinicians, going back and forth, you'll end up with only a small fraction. Well, actually stayed denied. And so to address that administrative burden, we've built the FaroS, a revenue cycle operating system, completely agentic. The system starts with the triage and orchestration agent that takes in all the data that pair provide clinical records, combine it and routes any potential denial to a specialized agent that knows how to address and solve that problem. Could be an eligibility off denial and that agent is a specialist that knows how to go through and solve it. Let's look at an example of a completed denial that was processed. So here's an completed account where the pair requested additional information. The triage agent received information and routed to specialized lacks infotation. That agent got to work, reading the medical record, looking at the denial which explained what information was needed, looking through the ontology and identifying all the information the pair needs. The agent then gathered the required documentation together into a cohesive packet ready to send and actually sent it to the pair automatically, completely automatically. In this case, this is completely resolved without human intervention at all. This is a process that would typically take about 20 to 40 minutes for a person to just look through everything, try to understand what's going on and collect the packet and send it through. This is agent orchestration, the right agent working on the right problem at the right time. Next is a look at an aimed progress case requiring an appeal. In this case, the triage agent identified the denial and routed an appeals agent, which gathers clinical documentation, research the pair's denial rationale and drafts an appeal letter. Here's where human and AI collaboration becomes critical. Appeals require clinical judgment. So the agent surfaces a recommendation for a specialist to review and refine. It's now replacing humans, it empowers them. The agent handles the tedious work of gathering all this data so the specialist can focus on the high value decision. This mod we believe translates across industries, AI handles volumes and the complexity of big data and humans provide judgment and expertise. Zooming out, these are all examples of just one workflow each. But behind this is a system of agents that constantly are working in parallel across thousands of accounts, each managed by an appropriate agent with human oversight where it matters most. What makes this all possible is the unified ontology, connecting clinical data, claims data, pair rules and appeal history together, along with the final outcome. So in agents hand off work, they pass the full context. The triage agent makes sure the lax info agent sees what's been tried before, what documentation was submitted and what the pair requires. And critically, every decision, every action that got taken by humans and AI, and all the decision and final outcome makes it back to the ontology. So our agents get smarter over time, so you can imagine a lax info agent learning what works for specific payers, denial types and hospital systems. Great, so John showed you it's great that the system can autonomously resolve problems or denial when they happen, but I mentioned it's an interconnected system and it's even better to prevent the problems from happening in the first place. So what you're seeing now is the denial prevention part of the fair operating system. So this is where we have agents that are monitoring, pair policy changes, and they're also monitoring denial trends and actual payer behaviors from denials that we've seen in the past. And the agent had made a recommendation, is come up with an idea for some logic that should be implemented to prevent denials on claims going out in the future. It came up with a back test, it actually looked at claims that have been previously submitted and estimated that we could resolve almost all of the denials, we could prevent them from happening in the first place, and it would reduce the amount of work by about 75% and accelerate the time to payment by about 2x. So this is like a look behind the scenes, but it did this with full access to the ontology and all the tools that are available, and it actually wrote all the Python code for, that can be implemented into production. We have a human in the loop looking at this right now, just for validation, but over time, as we get more confident, we can imagine this being fully agentic. So hopefully that gives you a sense of what we're building here. We view ourselves at R1 that we've been pioneering revenue cycle technology for a long time, workflow, rules engines, machine learning, robotic process automation. But also this is the most excited we've ever been, because this can achieve a vision of comprehensive automation with AI that we think can really benefit and lower the cost of administrative costs for the entire system that can benefit not just our customers, providers, but also for pairs and patience. Thanks a lot.
