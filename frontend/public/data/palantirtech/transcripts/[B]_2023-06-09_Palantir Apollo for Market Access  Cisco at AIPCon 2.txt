TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I appreciate the opportunity to be with you today to explain what we're doing at the company I work with with Palantir. As was stated, my name is Mike Yaukers. I focus on government solutions inside of a company called Cisco, that's Cisco with the C, the networking company, not the food company in case there's any confusion about that. I've spent 20 or so years focused on the US federal government at Cisco and a pre-sale systems engineering role and about a year ago I shifted into an IT operations role inside of Cisco supporting that customer. Today I want to share with you, I'm going to try to thread a needle here and depending on where you sit in the audience, if you support the federal government or deal with regulations based on the US federal government you'll understand kind of the lens that I'm applying to this, but if you support global governments or operate in other regulated industries, I think this will resonate with you as well. So the needle I'm going to try to thread is to kind of talk about some different problem sets that we're faced with at Cisco and how we're solving them. To be crystal clear, it was only a few months ago that I sat in the audience where you are now and I kept hearing about foundry and the ontology and it turns out I'm an Apollo customer of Cisco, so I mean of Palantir, so I just want to be clear about that upfront as well. I was at FoundryCon thinking and trying to figure out how to adopt Apollo and here I am at AIPCon to talk about Apollo, but I just want to be clear about the problems we're solving. So after plenty of years and a lot of money invested from Cisco and me, I can stand before you today and say my purpose in life is service. And I work for a company whose purpose is to create an inclusive future for all. That's what we're doing at Cisco. It is our stated intention to create an inclusive future for all. And I think that's really cool. I love these big aspirational goals. I think they're really important to have because it's how you rally troops and how you go take on big problem sets. However, I've learned over time, I've always heard this statement in existential threat and I've never understood it until I really started thinking about the problem sets that were facing myself and my team at Cisco. And what I mean in this context is if I am trying to provide service to the customers that I support, which in the context of this discussion is the US federal government. And if Cisco is trying to build an inclusive future for all, but if we can't deliver our capabilities to our customers so that they can serve their customers in the environments that they needed in, that is a true existential threat. I supported a team of a couple hundred engineers around the world supporting global governments. And the idea is that we weren't going to be able to help our customers solve their problems. Ultimately, if you play that out, it means that we as a team don't need to exist. That's an existential threat. And I heard this statement all along, people say this, they're like, oh, we're facing this existential threat. I had no idea what that meant until I started looking across my team and realizing, I don't ever want to have to lay off people ever again in my lifetime. So to me, very viscerally, it was this kind of what can I do, what sorts of problems can I solve inside of Cisco. But if you extend that and think about, if my company, if our entire purpose is to create this inclusive future for all, if we can't reach all, then we can't actually realize our own vision. So we found a way to solve this problem, surprise, it's with volunteer. But let me kind of build this out a little bit. This is where I'm going to try to thread this needle. If you look at this picture, the kind of logo's in the middle. If you're Cisco customers at all, you might recognize WebEx, you might recognize Mirackey. The cloud is our CX cloud, which is something that we're doing to try to provide better capabilities and services to our customers. You may or may not be familiar with that. And then at the bottom is meant to represent the kind of global nature of the company that I work with. So the government services and solutions that I'm now responsible for providing inside of Cisco are global in nature. They're not just focused on the US, but the US government is where my background is, so that tends to be where I kind of talk through these use cases. But if you think about this, there's kind of Europe on the left. Think about things like GDPR, data sovereignty, types of problems. There are issues there that need to be solved for that are challenging if you're a company like mine who wants to provide cloud-based services to our customers in Europe. But we're a US-based company. And if our data resides in the US, and that becomes a problem for our customers, right? In Europe. And then the middle is kind of North America. We can bore you to tears with US government regulations, be they actual federal government regulations as it applies to the government itself or the regulations that they push forward into these other industries that we all have to deal with. And then on the right is Australia. And I put that there because part of my heart is in Australia right now. My youngest son is doing a study abroad in Australia. But the point is we have actual legitimate use cases that we're trying to solve with the Australian government, which kind of proves the point that I'm trying to make here. But if you think about this, multiple cloud offers, I'm just representing three of which we have a bunch inside of Cisco in this picture as represented by WebEx, Marockie, and CX Cloud, going to multiple geographies and then inside of those geographies, multiple sets of regulatory requirements that we have to meet along the way. This is an incredibly complex problem. And the question over here was asked about at what level of the company do you have to be engaged to kind of push these things forward. I'm a few steps removed from the C-suite inside of my company. But I could tell you this is a problem that the C-suite of the company that I'm working for is trying to solve. How do we drive this inclusive future for all? Meet the demands and needs of all of these customers in this world of sort of economic nationalism. That's another one of my favorite phrases that I never understood until I started having to live it. You know, how we solve in these, right? Because the idea, the whole promise of cloud is I could build something where I want to build it and run it on behalf of customers. And the customers don't have to deal with that problem set anymore. But if we can't meet the requirements of where we want to take these solutions, then we have a real problem. And one of the ways we could meet these solutions, and maybe some of you guys try this, is just build separate environments everywhere you want to go. So let's take a solution. We'll pick on Cisco WebEx. And let's think about this. If I wanted to build WebEx and meet the United States government, just as itself a customer, it has five different sets of requirements when you look at cloud requirements to meet the United States government. They're classified for the intelligence community, the Department of Defense. There's unclassified for the Department of Defense, but not all unclassified is the same inside the context of the United States government. And then there's truly like sort of civilian services. So in the US, just supporting the government, that's three different accrediting bodies. That's GSA doing FedRAMP, that's dissed doing all the DOD certification stuff, and then that's the intelligence community doing its own certification stuff. So if you're interested in this kind of stuff, I'm not going to dwell on these, but if you're interested in this kind of stuff, Google the blog that Palantir wrote about how they solve for DOD Impact Level 6 or IEL6, it's fascinating reading and really kind of reinforces the point I'm making here today. But the point is, we had to figure out a way inside Cisco to separate product development from product deployment. So I can't, there's not enough time and not enough money in the world, even in a big company like mine to go build bespoke solutions. To the order of five, just to meet the United States federal government requirements, I haven't even touched private industry inside the US, and then you extend that globally. There's not enough time and there's not enough money and there's not enough talent to go do that. So I've spent the last six years ranting and raving about DevOps and the notion of crashing together your development team and your operations team. It's awesome. Culture change, it's hard to get done, but it's really, really cool and it's really, really powerful when you can pull it off. But the problem is you can't have DevOps teams and meet those global requirements if you don't separate your development from operations. So I might head start turning and I'm like, wait a second, I've been trying to bring these things together and now somehow I have to separate them again. I'm going to lose all the goodness of what we were trying to solve for when we brought development and operations together. We can't have that. The problem we were trying to solve was logically, logistically, physically to meet requirements like certain citizens with certain data living in certain places like those are hard requirements that are given to us globally. How do we solve for those in operating these solutions, but how do we get the goodness of DevOps? So the first thing we were trying to figure out was in a physical way, keep development from operations separate. And then the notion was, okay, but one of the cool things about cloud and DevOps is we can build it once and deploy it many. So we're faced with this like, oh my gosh, like we spent all this time crashing together DevOps, now we're going to separate them, but we still want to build something once and deploy it and solve all these problems. So the solution is Apollo and that's why I'm here today because we work with Palantir, we use their platform called Apollo and we solve those two problems that I just described to meet our customer demand. This is an interesting kind of picture. It took us forever to figure out how to try to represent the complexity of what we're dealing with in a very simple graphic. But the point here is at the top, I'm still picking on WebEx because our executive vice president of engineering, security and collaboration, we're taking WebEx and we're driving through this. We're providing WebEx to meet these requirements on a global government basis. The little picture there is this thing called a monitor. The monitor is what you build when you're building out Apollo. It drags along through Apollo, central hub is where we register all this stuff. If we were in a perfect world and everything we're contained and we're all registered properly through Kubernetes and we had all our Helm charts all straightened out, life would be easy. Life is not easy, right? We're all practical people that's not the world we live in. So we do some interesting things in the central hub and then we get this notion of a very hard line. This is where I start to separate if I'm doing classified and unclassified work, if I'm trying to meet localized requirements in the country of Germany, for example, I can't have people back here operating those environments. It's a very hard line between the central hub and then these remote hubs. Now I can meet customer requirements in the remote hubs, but I have this interesting problem that this clock that sits in the middle. I have different accrediting bodies with different sets of requirements before I'm allowed to push stuff remotely. Again back to my United States government example, I got to go deal with GSA. I got to deal with DISA and I have to deal with the intelligence community. All have different requirements. All have different timelines. All have different things they want to see before I'm able to move things. But Apollo gives us this capability and the cool thing is where I'm in a company where we're figuring this out on our own, we're partnering with a company in Palo Tier that's already solved these problems. So I don't have to go and roll my own and figure this stuff out the hard way. I can leverage Apollo and do this interesting thing where I can let the development teams inside us go that are not my responsibility, but I work with very closely. They can do what they do best. They can do their development wherever they are. From a global point of view, they can drop off features. Some of our be used business units deliver stuff on the order of like tens to hundreds of new software drops a day. Let me tell you if you try to push that inside of a regulated environment, it makes people's head explode when you say I want to bring tens software updates every single day including weekends across this boundary. That's not a hard line. The accreditors are like no, try again, that's not going to happen. But this is what we can do with Apollo. We've separated development from deployment of the environments and then we allow the product development teams to go do what they do best. Then we build service and our site reliability engineering teams or SRE teams to actually go running these environments that can meet the local requirements of whatever environment is we're going to. But clearances if they need it and we can kind of meet the requirements along the way. We end up in this really cool and I want to say magical place. I am a huge fan of Simon Sinek. If the engineers and architects who I get to work with every day were here, I like to claim I'm an engineer. I have a double lead degree and a computer science degree. The people I work with every day will tell you I've been a manager and a leader for so long. It freaks them out when I touch keyboards. They call me in the context of SRE. They call me chaos monkey because I break things in ways they didn't expect. I think that's good. They don't see it that way. But why am I here? Simon Sinek is one of my favorite authors when it comes to leadership. Simon Sinek says always start with the why. I'm breaking that rule because I'm ending with the why but I wanted to share this with you because I had this opportunity. More than anything, I want to express gratitude for the Palantir team that I get to work with and the Palantir capabilities that we're bringing inside of Cisco because we are solving a real hard problem that I'm convinced is an existential threat to me as an individual and my company as a company. So I was sitting right there in the back row because I'm a back row conigai right in the middle of this audience at the last conference and I took precisely one note the entire time I was here and that note is this quote. I brought this with you. Isn't it cool when you have a prop? That note was iterate with a partner you trust and to me that's what this is about. I'm headed into uncharted territories and a company that is a massive as the company that I work with and I want to work with someone who understands not necessarily has solved all these problems but at least understands the problems that we're faced with. So we got a fighting chance to iterate through this thing and go figure out how to solve for that existential threat. So my quote, the thing that brought me back here today and why I'm so happy to be working with Palantir in Apollo as a platform is exactly this. I'm iterating with a partner I trust. And so more than anything I just want to express my gratitude to the Palantir team for everything that they've done to support us. If you have any questions about what we're doing inside Asisco and how we're using Apollo I'll be around all day. I'd love to engage with people. Thank you for your time and attention.
