TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

So I was actually born in Mumbai in India, but my parents and I immigrated to the US when I was specifically New Jersey when I was about three years old, effectively in pursuit of the American dream. So better opportunities, better education for me, and grew up. So all my early memories are from growing up in the US, but I moved back to India for three or period between 10 and 13. My parents effectively wanted me to get more exposed to our family, our culture, our traditions, which they didn't feel like I had access to living in the US. So we moved back for a bit of time during very formative years, but we very quickly moved back because I didn't really love the education system in India, the opportunities there. It's a beautiful place, but I think the sort of by design, but mostly by necessity because there's so many people, there isn't as much of an emphasis on creativity, curiosity, and sort of the empirical within the Indian education system. A lot of it focuses on sort of like memorization and doing things in a very specific way. And so it felt very much like a production line. I was just like churning out people who have the same knowledge, who are applying it in the same way. And so it instilled a deep appreciation for the American entrepreneurial spirit when I moved back to the US. Wow. Okay. So you're moving back young or sort of mid-teen. What happened next? How did you decide where to go to school? What did you study? Yeah. So I actually after high school wanted to go to the Air Force Academy, but I wasn't a US citizen at the time. And so it was a bit of a gamble. And that if I went to the Air Force Academy and wasn't a citizen by the time I graduated, I wouldn't have been able to be a commissioned officer. And so instead I went to what I thought was the next best thing at the time, which was doing aerospace engineering at Michigan. But in effect, I felt very compelled to, but I was both very drawn to this sort of like American ideals and culture and values that we espoused as a country and civilization. But I felt it sort of like deep desires to contribute back to that and preserve it for everyone else because I had a very deep appreciation of it from having experienced the sort of counterfactual. But yeah, so I ended up going to Michigan and ended up pivoting from aerospace to data science while it was there. Wow. Okay. Big pivot. Is that how you found out about Palantin? Yeah. So I actually did a, did a couple of internships in the sort of like insurance space, doing specifically machine learning and did an enjoy my time there. It was very sort of oriented around doing things that someone in the hierarchy told you to do. There was very little outcome orientation. And so while I loved the people and I loved the technology, it was, you know, fairly cutting edge. It didn't sort of scratch that itch that that sort of like desire I had to to solve real problems. And so I during college actually ended up starting a couple of things with some friends solving all manner of things from like helping educate students on the power of compound interest and index fund investing to, you know, finding chicken tenders in you miss dining halls. And so, you know, we were solving all manner of like, you know, problems, some of which maybe only applied to us like finding which dining halls are chicken tenders, but like a chicken nugget. Yeah, pretty much. But all that to say, I got addicted to that feeling of like being very close to the problem and having the, both the ability and the like the freedom to solve those problems. And so I was very set on joining a startup post college and an action and interviewed it a couple of places and was about to go to one. But one of the roommates that I had started one of those companies with was applying to Palantir. And so I heard about Palantir through him and, you know, did some research online looked it up and just had this feeling of like this place feels really cool. And so I was just kind of thinking sort of on the website is sort of oriented around what are the problems that the company is solving and that just that compel that very much compelled me to just go and apply that very same day on the website and went through the interview process and sort of the rest is history. Wow, and you applied, I guess that must be going on two years ago now as a forward deployed engineer. What does that mean that you've done? How did you get started? What was the first project? Yeah, I've done all manner of things in two years at Palantir. You know, in many ways it's felt like dog years in terms of like what I've gotten to do, the access to problems and sort of things I've been able to affect. So I've done everything from like originally started with doing sort of pilots, which is like 12 week engagements with new customers, did one with Marina company, did one with a chemicals manufacturing company, with a gym conglomerate. So it's also all manner of things early on. But since then I've sort of like also been able to be a part of our bootcamp go to market motion, which was sort of a pivot from how we traditionally engage with new customers where instead of taking 12 weeks to build them a solution, we were doing it in a matter of two to three days. And so that was incredibly exciting. I think was a period of a lot of growth for me as an individual. Because up until that point I had access to problems and was able to solve things for customers on the ground. And I didn't get to go through the motion of figuring out what is the most valuable problem to solve for them. I was sort of like solving these problems at the point at which we already knew sort of like what the customer is most pressing, most difficult thing was that they wanted to solve. And so I really enjoyed that bootcamp motion and sort of interacting with customers earlier where our software can solve pretty much anything when it comes to data and wheeling it. And so the sort of jazz motion of like identifying the problems and being able to pivot and figure out the best ways to solve them was incredibly exciting and very much in contrast with some of the stuff I hated about the Indian Education System or corporate bureaucracy, for example, where you're very much like a marching band, right? Like everyone's reading from the same sheet of music. There's very little flexibility in the agency to do the things you want. And so I really enjoyed that motion of talent here where you're everyone's singing their own individual melody and when you zoom out it all sounds like a jazz band. Yeah, that's primarily my focus. And over the last two years, whether it's customers in manufacturing or whether they're producing chemicals or batteries or engines, I've seen the same problem over and over again, which is software as a whole has failed to move as fast as it was promised, right? So whether it's ERP systems taking 21 months to implement on average or systems that just simply don't work. And so these people that gets interface with it, these customers are using Excel sheets and it's not because they love Excel, it's because they don't have any other choice. And so it's an incredibly motivating problem for me because in rewarding in that, we get to deploy our software very quickly days and weeks and then we get to actually see the solution affecting the people in a positive way and helping them do their jobs better, which in turn has all these down-to-ear impacts like the mission readiness of the Air Force. And so most of my time these days, it's spent sort of working with these customers and the manufacturing space helping bridge that gap between the software that is rigid, doesn't work, doesn't help their business move efficiently to supercharging the people on the ground that are actually driving the business forward. And I think in many ways, the thing I enjoy about that is the same thing I enjoyed about being in a startup, which is I get to be directly close, I get to be right next to the problem and I also get to design the solution and execute the solution. And I think that's true of everyone at Palantir and what's so special about this place is there's no distance between you, the problem, the people affected by the problem and the people who are going to use your solution. We've spoken in the past a bit about that combination of high autonomy, high agency with higher responsibility. How does that kind of manifest and what are you most excited about next? Yeah, I think the really interesting thing about Palantir is it's almost sort of like a distillation or maybe the best version of what I love about America, right? What I value so deeply about it is it's this group of people where we're all entrepreneurs in effect working together to solve hard problems and you have this sense of agency of freedom in many ways is like no one's going to tell you not to do something and agency is almost people will support you in pursuing ideas or solutions no matter how crazy they are. Right? And I think that's been like that's been very true of Palantir where like, you know, whether it's with like the bootcamp motion and trying to innovate on different types of boot camps or, you know, the first company I worked with we, you know, we were contracted to just build them a data warehouse effectively, which you know, it's not necessarily what we do, but we ended up, you know, we ended up building them a market 360 for their M&A team. And so the ability to pursue crazy ideas as long as they're actually driving value and impact for customers, I think is what's really special about Palantir and how it's manifested for me and how I see it manifesting for all of my peers as well. It's the best of, you know, what I love about America.
