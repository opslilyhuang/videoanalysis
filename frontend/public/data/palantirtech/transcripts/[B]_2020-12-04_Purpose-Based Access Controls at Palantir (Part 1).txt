TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The Volunteer Fantry is a software platform that allows organizations to bring their data together and then enables their users to conduct sophisticated analytics and operations on top of the unified data. Access to the platform does not necessarily mean access to all of the data it contains. Our customers can set up access controls to define which individuals get access to what data. This demo will show how our clients can implement a purpose-based access control model in palliantier foundry. A purpose is a specific objective that data is used to support. For example, in the health care context, one such purpose might be PPE allocation, making sure the supply of PPE to each hospital meets that hospital's specific needs. First, an operational decision maker proposes a purpose. If this purpose is approved as legitimate by information governance officials, the purpose gets a secure access control space in the foundry platform. No users or data can enter this space yet. Then, data that has been approved as necessary and proportionate for this work is added to the space. Finally, users can apply for access to the space if they've been tasked to work on this purpose. At each step of the process, a rich history of why any given approval has been made is recorded. Users never apply for data access directly, but instead must apply for access to a purpose, and each purpose contains only the data that has already been judged to be necessary and proportionate to achieve the stated goal. Let's see how this works in practice. In this first scenario, I'll play the role of an analyst who's been tasked with distributing protective equipment in the capital. For this demo, I have already been granted access to the foundry platform by my organisation, but I have not yet been granted access to any data. I am presented with a list of purposes. Each of these purposes represents a different work stream with different users and data. I'll choose the one that's matched to my responsibilities. To do this, I'll search Capital and PPE. Now I should check that this purpose is right for me. If I click into it, I can see a more detailed description of the purpose, along with other information such as who leads this project. I can also see which data assets are approved for work towards this purpose. If this matches my responsibilities, I can request access to this purpose. If approved, I'll get access to the secure space for this purpose, where the relevant data is held. I first select what access type I need. This will determine my permissions within the secure space. For example, users might be able to view but not edit or download data. Next, I must write a justification, according to organisational policy, about why I should be granted access to this purpose. I then submit my request to the owner of the purpose for evaluation. This may be a decision maker from the customer's data governance team or a domain expert that has undergone data governance training. Now let's switch roles to a purpose owner to look at how such a request would be evaluated. As a purpose owner, I have an inbox for access requests to my purposes. Let's evaluate the request we saw earlier. By clicking into this request, I am presented with the information I need to make a fully informed decision. I can see who made the request, their role and their organisation. I can see which purpose they've requested access to, what permissions they've requested, and their justification for doing so. This is a configurable view, so data governance teams can add any additional fields they require. If I'm unsatisfied with the request as it stands, I can enter into a discussion with the requester using an in-platform functionality. The complete history of this discussion is preserved in foundry and tied to the request. I could, for example, ask the data letter of approval from their manager be attached. If I'm satisfied that this request is now compliant with information governance standards, I can approve the request, recording a written justification for doing so. This will give the analyst access to the data they need to do their job.
