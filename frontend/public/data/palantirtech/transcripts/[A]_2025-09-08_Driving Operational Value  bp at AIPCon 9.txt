[Music] Please welcome from BP executive vice 
president technology Acha Amebleu and senior vice president digital delivery Sanjay Pande. [Music] 
So um hello everyone. This is Thunderhorse. This is one of our platforms that we operate in the 
we're here from BP. This is one of our platforms, our biggest platform that we operate in the 
Gulf of America. Um really hi everyone. It's really great to be with you today. Um we've been 
one we're one of Palunteer's first commercial customers. We've been working with Palunteer for 
over 10 years and it's really been a phenomenal journey to be working with them. This has been 
Palanteer has been a huge value creator for our company. It's been value for employees, value for 
our shareholders, for our customers across the board. We've gotten huge value from what we've 
done with Palunteer. Quick introduction by the way, my name is Amecha Ameble. I'm the EVP for 
technology at BP and I'm here with my colleague Sanjay Pande who's our senior vice president for 
digital delivery. So for those of you who may be unfamiliar with BP, we've been operating for about 
116 years. So a long time as a company. Um at the heart of our company, what our strategy is is 
we're about growing. We our strategy is to deliver um energy to the world today and tomorrow. We grow 
our we're growing our oil and gas business. We're focusing our customer and products business and 
we're investing into the energy transition in a very disciplined way. And technology underpins 
everything that we do in this in this part of our business. Um technology underpins us improving 
our operating efficiency, driving competitiveness, and as you can imagine, keeping people 
safe and secure in all of the platforms and everywhere we operate. And our approach to 
technology is based in all of this. And at core, at the core of our approach to technology, we use 
Palunteer. We've worked with Palunteer, as I said, for over a decade. Um, we have we've been doubling 
we're we've been worked with we've worked with Palunteer for over a decade, and now we're 
doubling down with that decade's worth of work with the new AIP system out of Palunteer. And this 
what this is going to be doing is really helping us drive a lot of competitiveness for BP as a 
company. Um what we're trying to do really as a company is build we're we're building an ontology. 
We we are actually advancing the ontology we build as with Palanteer as a company looking at every 
part of our company and connecting everything that we do. We we're trying to build a fully integrated 
fully forecastable business across our entire company. What you can see on the screen here is 
this is our Sherlock suite for example. What this does is it helps us look at how we manage when 
we have failures in our wells or our production systems. Everything goes into the ontology. 
Everything is trackable. It's connected through Palunteer and accessible to engineers everywhere 
in our company. So, this is what we're trying to do to make sure everything we do from our wells 
all the way through our platforms, everything it's all connected. And what does this look like? 
Another thing we're doing, we're building so um we actually heard Dr. Karp talk about data earlier 
today. We've heard other people talk about data. We're making this data accessible to everybody in 
our company. Again, using the using Palunteer's Foundry and the ontology, it's pulling the whole 
data from across our company all the way together. We're um using operational data from our fields 
in the Gulf of America all the way through to our wells in Kazan in the deserts of Kazan and 
making sure we're understanding actually what we can learn for how failures occur, how we make 
our systems better, how we make our systems more resilient, how we make our systems more productive 
every day. This is what we're doing through our Palunteer system. And you can imagine in a world 
where previously we actually had engineers trying to pull all of these data insights together just 
not connected not learning from each other. We are in our upstream business now. We've moved past 
that and that's what the ontology has helped us put in place. But we didn't we haven't actually 
we're not stopping there. We're taking this to our retail sites. We're taking it to our trading 
systems. We're taking it to our we're taking this across everywhere we operate in the company 
starting in the upstream to our refineries to make sure and our traders. We have a big trading 
organization to make sure they can leverage data across our entire company to drive value for 
BP. So this innovation really is I would say you know I'm sure many of you worry or you have 
conversations about returns on investment of different technologies you invest in. for us. 
I can say to you again very confidently year on year, we're getting triple figure investments 
from the investments that we've made in Palunteer without without failing. People across our 
company are we know about this and yeah, this is very clear. It's this is a value this is 
a been a big force value multiplier for us as a company. Um Sanjay is actually going to talk you 
through some details of what this has looked like in the Thunderhorse asset that we talked about. 
Again, we start there from a molecular basis and you can see how this can be or how it can be and 
is applied to the rest of our company. Sanjay, thank you Mecca. Um, excited to be here uh and 
represent the work of our teams and our business people uh across BP. Um, this is Thunderhorse. 
It's our largest production and drilling platform in the Gulf of America, capable of 250,000 barrels 
of oil a day. For a sense of scale, the main deck on Thunderhorse is about the size of uh three 
regulation sized football fields. It's massive. Um operating a platform like this is highly complex 
and we have to balance maximizing efficiency with the safety of our teams. It's a tough problem. 
The kind of complexity here translates to working with over 60,000 pieces of equipment 
uh attached to 40,000 real-time sensors and um 40 4,000 synthetic uh sensors streaming data 
from the asset. We ran over 1.4 million digital twin simulations in the last year alone. This 
kind of visibility that we get through Foundry is transformational at the asset level. Um, our 
teams, our engineers, I can interface with every dimension of the asset in one place in a way that 
I couldn't do before. And with AIP, we're not only looking at structured data, we're integrating 
and leveraging them into the same ontology. This is one asset, Thunderhorse. We're scaling 
this capability across dozens more globally. The foundation though is only as valuable as 
our ability to drive effective operations and decisions. And so by integrating the live 
sensor data with our physics-based models along with best practices and the engineering 
expertise of our talented operators, we're optimizing our assets without compromising 
safety. is job one for us is safety and capturing production deviations below target to support 
the reliability of the equipment and preventive maintenance across an equipment class and at 
the asset level. Um in the last 12 months the strong foundation has accelerated our ability 
to develop new use cases and drive value from AI. Um we'll look at two that we've built on 
AIP. Uh starting in the optimization space, um routing is one of our newest expansions and 
performing routing optimization through brute force techniques would take multiple weeks to set 
up, execute and evaluate and the existing digital twin system optimiz optimizers only give us a 
singular optimal solution. With AI, our engineers now can set up and run these optimizations in 
hours. It's a massive deal. uh an engineer can see the optimal solution and options close to 
optimal allowing us to consider operational factors like schedules risks and recommending 
a configuration to increase the production. Second one we'll look up we we'll look at how 
we're removing data silos and we talked about data sharing across organization and acha talked about 
that a little bit. It's vital to us as a large multinational and having an integrated data set 
our teams can use. Um, so we'll look at how we're analyzing uh our equipment data at scale. With 
AIP, we're further enhancing the data foundation by digitally encoding our best practices and 
engineering expertise using the AI agents um through AIP to surface insights in seconds. 
This has been scaled um relatively simply in fact across a 1.4 million pieces of equipment 
uh across our global oil and gas assets and this has reduced the time to get to operational 
insights on maintenance data by 75%. To put a finer point on it, this is all about operational 
excellence for us. Safety's at the core and assets like Thunderhorse that you saw um are incredibly 
incredibly hard uh to maintain and execute. Um so we're not just talking about unlocking value 
though, we're measuring it. And now we're in we're expanding the insights gained from our 
oil and gas business as a Mecha talked about to other parts of our portfolio. It's deeply 
complex an integrated energy value chain and this is how technology is enabling BP strategy uh 
in partnership with uh with Palunteer. Thank you. [Music]
