Hi, I'm Jared Weiss. I run data science at ARP. ARP is a nonprofit with about 35 million members. Our state admission is to empower people to choose how they live as they age. Our unstated mission is to send you a piece of mail when you turn 50 to let you know you're officially old. And we've used it in Palantir for about two years, logic for recommendation engines. There's thousands of ways to engage with ARP. We have tens of thousands of articles. We have offices in every state. We run events in every state. We have lots of hundreds of different benefits. We use recommendation engines to show the right thing to the right person to get them to further engage more deeply with ARP. Thanks, Jared. It's really exciting stuff. I know a lot of people are interested in hear more about that and we'll get into it. So my name is Don Arbano, as previously mentioned, with Ask When Tree Expert. I'm the director of operational insights. And one of the main things that we are focused on on our team is to make sure that we are informing our operations departments so they can better communicate with our customers. There's one thing that I think we all know is that customers are very impatient and they have a right to be with their spending a lot of money if they're coming to us for a service. So we want to make sure that we're giving them that return on investment very quickly. So one of the things that we wanted to do with Palantir is ensure that our data science platform and our pipelines for information was sped up. Since bringing them on board, it has definitely done that. So we'll give them to that in a few minutes. But just curious, what's your plan for the next five and maybe maybe 10? Well, I'm hoping this is going to resonate with you and stuff we've been talking about going from reactive to proactive. So right now our models provide lifts of 10 to 90% in terms of engagement to get people to come back to the site and engage with ARP a lot more frequently. But ARP is a very decentralized siloed organization which I'm sure none of you can relate to. And one thing that we think about a lot is ARP is unique in that we don't have one thing we're optimizing for. We have to optimize for membership and revenue and our social mission and to get people the information they want. And it's not easy to do all those at once. What we're looking forward to working with Palantir is more of a centralized kind of platform where if someone executive says hey, we want to turn the dial up on membership. How do we get more people to join? Or hey, we really want to enforce our social mission this year. How do we do that more frequently? We can now within the platform do that in all of the channels all over the place rather than just tweaking one channel at a time, which was what happens now. Yeah, that's excellent. And similar to what we're trying to do too, because one of the things that we have is we have constraints on the front end, whether customers, what they come and tell us, generally what their budget is. This is how much they have to spend because that's all they get. And utilities across the country that we work with are varying sizes, municipalities as well. And so from that standpoint, they know a lot of their limiting factors on the front end. What they don't know is where they should go and do their work. And one of the things that we've partnered with Palantir is to do a risk analysis of their distribution system, assuming figuring out where in their system they need to spend that money and where it to be most effective for their ratepayers. So we spend a lot of time with them. We've come with some incredibly good solutions with that. The next step to doing that would be to manage the work plan that we're going to use to work on their system and improve that reliability for them. And then furthermore is how do we look at that throughout the year and make sure that we're keeping track that we're on par with that. Because one of the things we want to make sure that we're doing is managing expectations. So I think an R team, one of the things that we say a lot is if we manage expectations, we always deliver. And we never want to have our clients to be surprised about something at the end of the year. So we are increasingly able to make this partnership with them where we can give them a smarter platform at the beginning of what they need to do for the year, how they can spend those dollars. We can track it throughout the year. And with the engine that we've built for that program design, we can make adjustments whether they be smaller large throughout the course of the year and ensure that we're going to reach their goal and their target by the end of the year. And that's something that I think a lot of customers will resonate with. And I feel like I've seen a lot of that happen across some of the examples that you guys have shared with us tonight is that something that you have to see is that you get thrown a curveball and you need to be able to effectively manage it. So one thing I'll just say working with the Palantir team is I feel like we've put a little bit in the tank and we've gotten a lot in return in a hurry. So I hope that the experience that you guys have had and I trust that it is is similar to ours because I'm looking forward to 2025 and what that's going to bring for us. You know that goes to the team as well. Thanks. Thanks all.
