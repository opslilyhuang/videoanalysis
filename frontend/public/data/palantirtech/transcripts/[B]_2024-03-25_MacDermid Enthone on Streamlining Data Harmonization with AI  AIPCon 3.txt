TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello. First of all, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that the work I'm going to describe is the product of a lot of really smart colleagues of mine, both within McDermott and Throne, element solutions as well as at Palantir. And so I'd like to thank them all for making this possible and allowing me to represent them. So let's talk about what we've done. This is not a bizarre situation, but we're a specialty chemicals company. We have grown up a great deal by acquisition in recent years. You may not know our name, but our products are used in almost everything you touch. If you drove in a car, flew in a plane, used a phone, used a laptop, our chemistry is used to produce all those things to make them reliable and higher performance. In about 2016, McDermott and Throne combined, and after much study, we're called McDermott and Throne. And these two companies, McDermott had a US heritage, both were global, McDermott had a US heritage and Throne had a German heritage. In 2017, I transferred within the company and moved to Germany to take over R&D. I am a chemist, which is kind of like strange that I'm talking about this, but that's how life goes sometimes. So these two entities combined, and then in 2021, we combined Coventia. And at that point, we sort of broke the camel's back. Our data systems were not aligned. We had lots of different ERPs. We had lots of different master data. A lot of it was redundant. And my R&D scientists were spending a huge amount of time having to sort through legacy codes to understand, is this material the same as that material? Is this product the same as that product? We compromised our effectiveness. And then just for the last bullet into the dead horse, we bought German company HSO recently just to compound the problem. So we had too much data. A lot of it was redundant and we needed to figure out a way to fix it. Well, IT, very helpful, smart group, people said, ah, we'll just put in one ERP, SAPS4, all quite easily done, of course, right? Well, as soon as we started studying this and looking at it, this challenge in the middle was a bull's eye on my head because we were going to be the rate limiting step in trying to cleanse and align data. And we were going to end up being the thing that prevented this from happening, which was not going to be pretty. And we needed to find a solution. After one very unfortunate project, we were introduced to Palantir, our CEO said, hey, you should take a look at this solution and see if it's something that we can use. And I almost wanted to retitle my talk. You had me at ontology because the first time I saw the presentation, I was like, oh my god, this is a gift from the heavens. And fortunately, it turned out to be all worth all the hype that was there. We were able to create the ontology, which was interesting to me, but I already knew it was messed up. The really cool thing for me was that now I had a diagram that it showed how badly messed up it was. But they were able to do all the things that I think many of you already realized they were able to hook into legacy systems, diagram it out, give a really excellent representation of the current situation. And then we designed some very nice apps in Foundry to figure out how to sort through all of it to speed it. And we've done a number of different apps in Foundry. This is the original one and it's still underway for cleansing raw material data. This is the dashboard I look at every morning to understand what's our progress. It shows me how many materials have been cleansed in every of the ERPs. It contains a data quality marker called the Collapse Factor. Amazingly, with like 2% of the available data predicted that it was going to be around 5.5, that means that we have 5.5 redundant codes for every unique raw material. This is what that amounts to. And it's proved to continue that way and continues to be one of the better predictions I've ever seen. So we are now in a position where I don't think we're going to be the right limiting step on an S4 implementation that we are doing in Germany this year. And we have other modules that we're working on that are going to speed other aspects of this process as well. Even more exciting potentially is what we're going to do next in the future. So like all of you, I attended a boot camp not too long ago and was able to sit down with one of the the Palantir colleagues of Ruthik. And in 90 minutes, he built an AIP module that was able to read a very poorly made scan of a supplier data sheet and compared against the specification of a raw material and issue a remarkably good judgment on whether or not it was equivalent to what we needed it to be. This is just sort of blown our mind and now we're going through the process of figuring out how do we do this? This unlocks the value creation capability of my chemist, who instead of shuffling papers and calling vendors are able to do what they do best, which is to look at chemistry and to figure out how we can make better products for the uses that we intend. And it also positions us as a company to be able to process and integrate future acquisitions much, much faster, which is going to let us deliver value to our customers that much quicker. So with that, I thank you all very much for your attention and Palantir for making such a cool product and that's my gift.
