All right. Let's go. All right. Let's go. All right. All right. I'm glad to be there. I'm glad to be here. Alex, where are we? Let's see. I live in a fantasy from KMI, so in the middle of the world, not far from Canada in New Hampshire. And if I'm not in Denver, I'm with my colleague, the San Juan de World, the German-Ball in London, where we're close to. I sit here and I'm talking about things that are interesting to us. And that's my joy. And here we have a lot of colleagues from Palette who work together. And yes, it's a bit crazy, it's a piece of it. It's a convergence between German unity and KMI. So things that have been taught to me have been made up for days when I was a child. Okay, but that's a great word. I'll take you to a journey from the US to Germany. You have a strong affinity to Germany. How long has Germany lived? How long has it been? How long has it been? How long has it been? How long has it been? How long has it been? What fascinated you to Germany? When I was a German, it was an interesting and interesting relationship. Of course, I've discovered how many of Germany has been in my relationship. My father's side came from West-Eustereich, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and then came to Germany and then to America. Of course, we have a cliché with German culture. But I really understood how German was in your relationship. And then, that means, when I came to Germany and talked about... So, I have a cliché, about German thinking and thinking. And that's when I had a lot of expectations from my friends who also felt this moment. I don't have to say anything anymore. I don't have to say anything. I enjoy it almost twice. Every time I meet people, I have a opinion that is not about different things. And my opinion is about myself and the depth of the depth of the country. I have been away from Germany since then, but that has really impressed me. I am very proud of my home. And I am very proud of my home. I have returned to America after my arrival at the Seminan Foreign Institute. And I started to live in Germany. I thought, maybe I will get a new place in America. And I have been re-imagined again. And I believe that the focus of Palantin and me was also... ...that again, again, in America, is to immerse in... ...so to say, America is to look at the perspective of a friend. And that this one name, even in Palantin, is to be found. Yes, that's what I notice. How much of this fascination in Germany or this thinking is in Palantin? Because Palantin is an American company, but you have that in your mind. So we are extremely complexly building products. So in America, when you build a business, the Palantin will first try to find the absolute most expensive product. And then you will buy it. That means you have 4,000 customers and 300 customers. And you will find the customers, the helpers and the workers. This is a key thing in America. We have started this for example, three or four years... ...to work on our first product. This product has also been in the data protection for 20 years... ...before people understand it, it is very important. So far, the deeper it goes, the more basic it works. So a very important thing that we have in America, is extremely unique. And more than what you have found in Germany from America. And that has helped us a lot. And it is one of the reasons why we have so many people. Okay, let me talk a bit about digitization. In Germany, it is a huge issue. Because every one of us is covered by Covid, but also by other things. The fact that we have a digitalization of a single piece of slavery. In Germany, I think that many people are going to think about it in Germany... ...when I am in slavery, when it comes to digitalization. I would say, I would say, positive. Why do you think we should be more careful? And what contribution can we make here? We were at the edge of the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky. The failure in Europe and Germany, is software, software, software, business, and science projects. The German businessmen go to America and look at what Americans do. They say, we are slaves. Whether it is true or not, that the whole thing is considered. Only what is in America, in other business, is art. So we are artists in business. Not science in business. And then you have the problem, not always, but in Europe, in Germany, that what is being built together is screwed together, but the magic that the whole society has, should, namely, believe it, is completely failed. And then you have no real living, but something that is not so interesting for the people. That is something that can be heard in Germany. And I hope that it will be heard because Germany is a different kind of software. It needs to be used for the whole industry. And yes, so. Okay, culture is very important. Let's get to it. But still, I think it is necessary that we can bring more value. Nevertheless, it is totally hope that many people know Palantir, but not really know what we actually do. So it is very difficult to get one in order to put in a template. Is it worth it? Yes. And yes, it is so that we are, but it is difficult to put in a template. It is only for Germany. My name is the example of the product that will be used in Germany. We work with famous masters at the university. We work with a product called PG, which was our first product. I have created a business from this product. You have access to all data, then you have access to data. So that means you can work in the framework of the company, with the use of the penibus rules on the earth in the company of the data protection. And you can work so well with it that the company, so you can work with the application of the application. So you can work with the application of the application, with the form of the German very strict rules in the company of the data protection. So it is one product. But that is the people who have the idea. So software is something that I cannot understand. It is a data card. The policy tips, my name, and without a user, without the user, without the user, I get a very close name of course. I do not want to say that a person does not care about me in the street, but does not want to say that. So it is unfair. In the past, it is also represented in China. But it is not possible software in the framework of a European company, to buy society without using the data protection, using the data protection to work. So it is something that the people do not understand. Then there are other products, Foundry. Foundry is a basic name, an art platform, where you can integrate data into commercial environment, so that people who do not know software can't write, can easily adjust, even if they are not able to write. So you can write software on Foundry. People who do not know software can't write in the framework. The data protection in the framework of the software, the land, the land, the work, and the best software development. And even better, because the whole work is already made. And you can easily do many things, even if the run, what we do in Foundry, is unfair, what Germany did in the framework of Metallic and Chemie. So at the beginning, you only have to think about energy. Energy is something that is going to be a car. Just like you think about data. But actually Chemie, what you do, the system car, is the fiber. Exactly, data is the thing that we work with, the things that all power. And with Foundry you can do it. But the normal people see the moment, the work with so many data, the results are so big, it is directly on the track. And the result is that the people who like it, think that they are the people, that it is very responsible. At the beginning, we also have it for the company. We are, and that is also for us, to say a little bit German. We are working on a new software product to build. Start from our local people here to learn, a little more sell, explain what the things are, what the things are, what the things are, a little bit of a Disney film, what good things that are, we are Bambi, we are not the person, we don't do it. And that is something we have to learn a little bit. But we have to know the total amount of things. Yes, that's what we're talking about. But you have one thing you always have in mind or you've already noticed, that I'm more in a relationship with Palaisier. I've been doing the installation, we developed software for seven years before the organization, organization, companies, they need them. And I thought, okay, I don't understand. No, you have a full-time job. So both of you, in this army, you have a job. Yes, yes. Where are the very two scenes? I was the one who could buy products that you can now. But I found it, I thought, I think if you work with balance, you understand that very quickly. But maybe, maybe, explain that again, but that's a very good thing. So the data protection is almost so a good example that I would not always always use. But, shortly before 20 years, almost 9, 9, 11, all have just been interested in that you don't even have the terrorist snaps. We said, no, we don't do that. We are, so to speak, not a lot of work. So in Wiersburg, because there are no such things as data protection and counter-campions. That's an idea that before 20 years, not only was it not necessary, but it was an idea that was almost done, that we didn't get the financial. That's an idea. Then we have the idea, so how can it be that all in the reason that more people are going to be able to manage the software, the hand-made software, the products that are out of software are the ones that are able to manage the software. The company is not able to manage the software, the rocket is not able to manage the software, the product that is being built out of software. And how can it be that only 10,000 people in the world can manage the software. And then the idea came out to build a platform with certain properties. So, live-having product is we do all of those things that only 50% can understand 500 people in the world and even 10 people in the world can make their product. And over these products, we are going to do that almost every possible to work with it, so that you can manage the more value of Silicon Valley without the work that you have to work with, without the only money that you have to work with. And that's what Foundry has been. And that's the idea that still doesn't always understand. That means that the product is very, very good, but that's not yet completely understood. Then we have three or four products, for example, how do you work in a room where you don't have any access to the enterprise. So, there are some typical problems that still don't understand, that are not understood now, but in the future it is not so that all data can be used in a business, that is used to your hand. So, you don't know if your hand is used to your robot or something, it's not going to be as well as a care enterprise. Are there people who are interested in asking, and then we are now working on the business tomorrow and tomorrow morning, and then we will be in chaos. Okay, before we come to the future, maybe we have more. Our motto in Germany is, yes, it's a pressure for those who have time, and actually we see pressure as power, which is actually a negative connotation. But we see something positive. Why is it a pressure in the world in which we live now? Because the art is like a software build. So, there are not many German. The deeper the quality of the product is, extreme, strong and German language. But one thing that is something else in the tech industry, is that you have to try relatively quickly, or try to improve, if it's not good, to build the German language from concept. That's how you learn to think in Germany. So, the concept will be perfect, you think, you will think about it for a long time, and then you have a translation, which lasts a long time. That's not the way the software build is. Concepts must be deeper and different from most of the business. But after you have that belief, you have to work relatively well, and also with full knowledge, that sometimes the same completely weakening is what you call it. That's completely okay. So, but this change in the world, between a whole concept, which is perhaps better, is a little more German, not German, but it is not so far away from the change in the world, and the translation, so long that you don't see that it's worthless, so long that you can't change it. And that's the way it works, between deep and relative, the most powerful work is the core methodology, all the research tech, and something, where I can always learn from my European relative. That's a very important point. I think you actually feel when you work here, but it's totally important to understand this technology not as knowledge, but as art. That's something you always get to know us, you say, we're a colony of art, we're a artist, we're not going to be able to develop some kind of blotin-half-chains, half-software. What can we learn from art? First, you need art. I mean, how do you think art is different from software than a science? Because science is expected to have all the points and the general perspective can be seen. But it's much later. A artist has a job and says, you have to build a base-ed, of course, relative and deep. And then you're running before the people have actually a knowledge. I'm very interested in that. But most software companies have now built what we've been building for seven years. And how they did that, and not just once, but we didn't expect that we were able to have it. We couldn't expect that until we understood it. So that's not a problem for all schools. So, yes, expect that until we understood it, you didn't have a job. So you can do something, because it's not a creative way to do it. Working only with the concept of a science that can be applied to the research, to prove it, is to be able to do it later. And we don't do that in the palette. And yes. Okay. Spanth, Alex, thank you very much. Thank you. I thank you too.
