TRANSCRIPT

If you think about the iOS system, it is where the user and the creator live in harmony. We can do the same thing in healthcare. Our health system across the state of Florida is seven hospitals, over 150 locations across the state. We can create an operating model that allows the creator, like the doctor, the nurse, the allied health professional, to exist in a very balanced way with the patient, with the customer. In a model that creates value for both, that's what Palantir, Foundry and AIP are doing for TGH and USF. The big takeaway for me of what the Palantir platform is doing for us is it takes the complex and does make it simple. You would think getting the right patient to an MRI is simple, but we're really multiplying this across thousands of patients who need lots of imaging or lots of other treatments and not having the right platform to help surface simply to our team, really who's next in line, who needs this most, and are they ready? So since we've rolled this out on MRI, we've seen an incredible improvement in our efficiency, a 30% decrease in turnaround time, which is pretty incredible. The Palantir platform allowed our team to have visibility, a legible picture of all the factors at stake, including the requirements we set for prioritization, which we configured into our workflow, and using information that made it actionable for our team members. Part failure is a common condition in patients in the hospital, and there's a lot of different pieces of information that need to be tracked and to have a complete picture of all the elements that affect a patient's outcome. The traditional way healthcare work is that a patient gets evaluated in the hospital every day, and decisions are made based on the last 24 hours for the next 24 hours. And now with information like this being kind of served up, we can make plans and therefore can get the patient back to their pre-acute state faster, get them out of the hospital and home to their loved ones healthier faster. When you don't have software that helps create that timeline for you and bring all that relevant information right in front of you to make decisions, you end up doing what we call a lot of chart diving, meaning you're really pulling from all this information that's in front of you in digital format, but still in lots of different places, and trying to piece that together in almost a manual nature. Palantir has been really helpful to providers and everybody involved in the healthcare system from the pure fact that we're able to get information in our fingertips more readily and be more efficient with our workflows. Substances is the number one cause of hospital-related deaths in the world. With Palantir's support, TGH configured and operating systems specifically around our subsist workflows and our enhanced criteria. That operating system enables us to reach huge amounts of patient data from the EMR and bring it to life. So powered by Palantir, the hospital's rapid response team is able to be that extra line of defense for every subsist patient and make sure that they are getting the right care at the right time. So the most incredible part from start to finish this new solution process took just six weeks to build and implement. We've seen no drop in our bundle compliance, which is the main process metric that we keep track of for our subsist patients. It's a vital part of our broadening efforts to improve subsist-related mortality. We want to expand this into our ICUs where it's really, really difficult to find subsist patients because everyone's sick trying to develop those solutions and then roll those out to the frontline care team would be probably unique. Palantir has really revolutionized our analytics program. And I've assumed responsibility for the program. We were really more of a reporting entity leveraging homegrown SQL databases. And what Palantir has allowed us to do is to rapidly scale all of our data assets into a common repository and have the ability to write what I call analytic applications on top of those. So what we do is we're able to actually serve up information, leveraging predictive models and to really to become a data-driven organization. So I always tell folks, healthcare is, we're data rich but we're information poor. We have tons of information, but it's really locked within a lot of systems, a lot of free text, things that are difficult to get to and to derive the value from. Electronic medical records systems serve as comprehensive data repositories. They often contain overwhelming amounts of information. Utilizing the Palantir platform, we can highlight critical insights and enrich them with external data and advanced models transforming complex data within electronic medical records into visible and actionable intelligence. And what Palantir has allowed us to do is to bring in all of these disparate data sets, aggregate them together, and then build applications on top of those where our team members are leveraging those and where we are now predicting cases, census, not just hours in advance but days in advance. It's really transformed how we operate and it allows us to provide better patient care. People struggle with the healthcare industry because of the fragmentation, because it's disjointed and it's siloed. So how do you change the way we're organized? How do you change the way we think? We want to build a new operating system and model for healthcare, not just in our communities, not just in the state, but we actually want to be a model for the country. So when I talk about the DNA being changed in our health system, that's exactly what I mean. We are thinking differently, we're behaving differently, we're producing different and better results, we're doing it in a more highly reliable way and a more resilient way. And we're passing that value over to the consumer, the entire system has to be wired through Founder E&A IP. And that's the journey that we're on.
