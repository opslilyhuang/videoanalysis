[♪ Right Where the Sun rises — Aꁼ стお願い — Plays the Nourished Songうどん. We're back in the freezer, tonight, so you should get here as soon as possible.' San Luis... Barbie presents... Theада has certainly eaten hundred years loves Poola-街國家 forever. To grind others and eat them all the way, they can therefore eat tomato's armpits. Finals are gone! Okay, well, I think we're ready. So good afternoon, thank you for joining me. My name is Sophie Hildebrand. I'm the Chief Technology Officer at AdNOC. And I believe my guest here today doesn't actually need an introduction. He's got an awful lot of followers on YouTube and social media. But for those of you who don't know who he is, today we've got Dr. Alex Carp with us. He's joining us for Attapec. Is this your first Attapec? It is. OK, fantastic. He is the CEO of Palantir. And for those of you who don't know what Palantir Technology is does, they're one of the world's leading AI data integration analytics companies in the world. And AI's in the media a lot. There's a lot going on. It's exciting. It's powerful. It's really cool. Some people are really scared by it. And we are really honored to have Alex with us today for this conversation. So rather than me talking, I am going to start asking Alex questions. But I think one of the big things is he has recently been recognized by Time Magazine as one of the world's 100 most influential people in AI. I think 100. He's probably like top one or two, actually, rather than in the top 100. So Alex, thanks for joining us here in the UAE at Attapec. I hope you're enjoying your first Attapec. And I've been doing a lot of reading about you and watching your videos, trying to learn a bit more about Alex as a person. Hopefully that worked out for me. Maybe you should have read less, witness less. So one of the things that I understand is you're addicted to fitness. And you're kind of, you like to spend your time cross-country skiing. I'm from a northern climate. I'm from Canada. So I spend time out in the snow, out in the forest. And I know how quiet it can get. And I'm wondering, what does someone like Dr. Alex carve? Think about when you're in the air. By the way, I love this tone of Canadian respect. It's like it is true. I have millions and millions of people watch our somewhere like 80 million people watch it. But it's kind of this vibe of irreverence on both sides, which I respect. But this whole Canadian be nice to me vibe. I definitely could get used to this. Yeah. So in Canada, actually, and the Emirates have played Emirates, I come here many, many, many times. And there's a lot to learn. And that one can respect here. And then Canada, to adjacently answer your question in a way that I don't think I've ever answered publicly. So I was kind of interested in the outdoors when I was a kid. And I addicted to canoeing. And the best canoeing in the world is well known to be Canada. And my interest in cross-country skiing, which started off much later, really began. To be a proficient canoe, or the person in the back has to do something called a J-stroke, which is the way in which you keep the canoe going steadily forward without swishing back and forth from side to side. It actually looks very easy to do. It is nearly impossible to learn. And I am the proud purveyor of the best J-stroke of any company in America, certainly hands down, because I canoeed from Tamagami to James Bay, which was crazy adventurous and probably stupid. But there's a lot in your question that we should move on to topics that will interest more people. But there's the outdoors. Why do you like the outdoors? I'm actually not addicted to fitness. I am addicted to what I would call an art in nature. So there is this Germanic tradition of being one with nature, which I probably inherited. And whether it's canoeing or cross-country skiing, there's a stillness and a kind of a oneness with something much larger and living. There's an energy side of it. I'm a Tai Chi practitioner, which I came to a door later. And then, of course, to do it, you have to be very physically fit. And I'm more addicted to being good enough to practice the art, which in cross-country means having high VO2 max, being having muscles that are stronger than they look as opposed to muscles that are bigger than they are strong. And then to the more salient version, among people who are in business, if you had to divide people, you would could as say, primarily competitive, primarily creative. And I'm definitely on the primarily creative side. So I, of course, Palantir does compete, but we, by and large, compete by non-competing. So if you look at the products we built, they were built years before anyone thought they would be relevant. And they were built based on creative ideas. And I wasn't, we have a product for the special forces. I was only minimally involved in, but Foundry, PGA, AIP, are our biggest products. And I was, I had creative insights. I don't know where they came from. But turning off my brain, at a high end of physical activity, the most important part is actually recovery. And this is, if you have like a, when I was a kid, I was told I was dyslexic, but in reality, and that was pejorative at the time. Now, honestly, I think at some point we'll be testing and putting everyone in charge who's dyslexic. But it was definitely not what you wanted to hear in your high IQ, or I queued it to the very, but it, it, it, it, turning off your brain, just like taking a day off if you're doing a lot of sports, probably the most important thing you can do if you have a highly active brain. It's very hard to turn it off, though, because, yeah, I agree. Yeah. And that, that's what really happens. Like, when I'm actually classicking, primarily, I skate in class, which are two forms of that. Or whatever I'm doing that's like, or running in the woods, it, my brain is going into a place where it's not processing. By the way, and I don't mean just processing important things. I mean, I'm processing all sorts of things that are absolutely irrelevant, that are bogging down my brain. And then, you occasionally make some pretty good decisions that you might not have made otherwise, like building certain features into PG, focusing on foundry years before anyone thought this was relevant. Other things. Creating space in that brain. To do other things. It's very, it's, it's, it's set. But by the way, medicine, this is like individualized medicine. It, what, my disabilities are more, I need to shut off the creative, what you would call creative, what we could even progiratively call disorganized brain in order for it to fully engage when it is existential, before you realize it's existential, which is what a creative person's doing in business, or an art, or in, I tend not, I don't actually believe business is the most important meti, it just happens to be the most important meti I'm really good at. So, I don't say I would have rather be, I would have rather been a, you know, painter, but it, it happens that, but it, you, I, I, I observed my mom, who's a very high end artist, it's, it's very, very hard to manage talent and management of talent are different at the highest level. If you want to do something important, you need to do both well. Yep, I agree. Well, so now we've sort of talked about your, your visionary things that you saw early that are now being applied in business today. You probably, at the start, didn't see the use for it, what you're doing today, but you could see forward. Yesterday, someone described you as someone who can see around corners, but you're, a lot of Palantir's work has started in defense, and I know you've done a lot of work in defense, but now you're here in the biggest energy conference in the world at Atapec, and we're talking about energy and the energy transition and transforming, decarbonizing and future-proofing, and I'm curious what you see around what's cross-sector, what matters, looking from defense into energy, into sustainability, energy transition, we're building an entirely new energy transmission network, and all of this is happening right now, we're right in the middle of it. So what sort of cross-sector applications do you see? Well, there's a lot of questions in that question. One of the things just to reflect upon, it's true Palantir is the first company that's publicly traded that maybe since the 50s that built cutting-edge technology for the government and then dual-functioned it. By the way, though, this was how in the industrial empires of the West were built. It just happened that without being pejorative, the companies that produce for some of them are not, some of them are very good, some of them obviously aren't. No longer either do or can produce things that are so transformational that they will be used in a civilian context. By the way, one of the biggest reasons for somewhat bizarre discourse in Western countries is the people involved in tech are not producing things that you could easily ascribe to being valuable. That's why they have to give all their money to philanthropy. But people ask me about this all the time, like, but I'm doing the most important thing in the world. I don't have time for anything else. So that this was a common thing. It is no longer common. It's very interesting about the oil and gas industry and in general governments is you have, it went on a government defense. You have some of the most complicated engineering processes in the world. You have had some of the most talented people in the world historically go into these industries. There's just a lot of similarities. I'm just going to go through a couple. You have an industry that was primarily hard where it's in the physical world. You have pockets of the world that produce a lot of the engineers. You're a good example of this. The companies are actually, this breaks off a little in defense, but we're actually used to be run by engineers. That's been part of the problem in the current large defense companies. There are really two problems. They are being procured automatically because of what country they are, and basically so obviously the need to perform declines. In the oil and gas context, that's not as much the case. So you have very difficult processes being managed from time to bottom, bottomed up mostly by people who are engineers or are very technical. The technical complexity is very much underestimated by the public, which means when you have discourse around, let's call it, values. So in the defense context, it'd be who to under what condition do we use these technologies, both in a macro sense, when do we go to war, when do we defend ourselves, how, when we use these technologies under what conditions, for example, in the selection context, which people are targeted, which people aren't, is it in conformity with international law, are norms, which are not always the same, or not. And there are legitimate questions there, but also in the discourse, you often have a clash, which is not even about the issues, it's about people on the outside not understanding the technical complexity of the ethical, the doctrine, the ethical doctrines internally, and quite frankly, the engineering complexity involved because people have seen a movie it automatically happens. Just like very few people know the complexity of extracting hydrocarbons, even before you get to emissions. Absolutely. And I completely agree with you. So my entire, spent over 30 years in the energy industry and through my career, I've recognized this industry has done amazing, complicated things. It's a high tech industry, but as you said, it's a combination of hardware and physical assets and, and, and a product that needs to be very carefully managed. But you also started talking about building trust. Yeah. So this is where, and this is where I think, well, there's two things going on in both defense and everywhere in the world, but I would say, however you want to define oil and gas, because it's a very complex industry, but let's just call it the management of hydrocarbons broadly. And the defense is broadly technology that could be used in a lethal way. So very broadly defined. You have industries that were primarily hardware industries that have determined the outcome of countries, their ability to work with defense or hydrocarbons or both, has really led to this scent or fall of empires. And now you have, in both cases or around the world, you have a move from pure hardware to hardware software combinations where you at very least are going to need both and where in some cases, but not all, the software becomes the dominant part. While simultaneously having regulatory constraints that are, I'm not here being normative, let's just assume all the regulatory constraints are noble and wonderful, impose engineering complexity on the underlying product, whether that product is how lethal your defense is or how efficient your hybrid hydrocarbons are, that are, let's assume now steel man or woman this, they're all justified, but, but impose enormous engineering complexity on the underlying production. Our galvanized public opinion, so everybody has an opinion about, if you ask people, what do they have opinion about, they'll say climate and war probably, and then probably the economy, I don't know, depends where you are. And these institutions are now confronted with a new form of technology, which has similarities to hardware, but it's not the same. And so you see places that adopt this very well, let's just take a neutral example defense so we're not, but you see there are countries you range out performance, it's like of what you would have expected, that because they're able to adopt technology, meaning in this case software, software embedded in hardware, by the way it changes your product, so like small, lower end hardware products combined with higher end software products can outperform high end hardware products that are very expensive and require supply chains that are complicated, especially in a disjoint world. And then you also have environments where people who are reasonably technical are impaired because they want to believe that the hardware and the software are the same and require the same skills. And you can see an example of this as America's massive out performance in software and Europe's more struggled effort to some of the best hardware companies in the world, in a bar none in Europe, obviously. But there's a way in which the adoption, it is surprising how if you made a list of the best innovative hardware companies in the world, you would get lots of diversity in terms of like Europe, America, other places. If you move to software, you see a domination by America and then countries like the Emirates which are much more equipped to adopt and innovate in the software context, then say European counterparts that have very, very large, I'm speaking in generalities here, obviously there are software companies in Europe and there are a lot of hardware companies in Europe. But in general, you see how this shift can really shift the trajectory of countries for positive negative. And by the way, as much as people I think would watch this are saying, well that's true, I think people underestimate how true it is because the other thing software has done is accelerate trends, positive and negative. Software, I'm a huge believer in high quality software because we, as individuals touch the software every day and we have more and more software that we're touching, it needs to work, it needs to give us insights to help quiet our brains, do things that you spoke about earlier. But trust is a big part of software and insights and there's been a lot going on in the media around AI and regulation and trust. How do you and Palantir see the role of AI and fostering trust and collaboration? And kind of, you talk about it, different parts of the world have whether it's different regulations, different values, different things that we look at. How do you see AI helping foster the trust and the collaboration? There's a lot of complexity in that. First of all, there are different kinds of software with enterprise software and algorithms. There's a pretty straightforward way to do this, which is like you build transparency into your architecture. And for those things, I could give you the simple but also true answer that you need to de-politicize these things. For example, I tell you something that's true and no one believes. A lot of our success came from focusing on data protection and civil liberties. Because the world is politicized and people often have believed us, what I think is valuable about people who have more of a neutral attitude to technology like what I think you find in the Emirates and what you find in America and what you find in England and other places. As long as the person doing the judgment is actually neutral and your transparent, you can deal with these issues. Now, you have to then codify what transparent means because there are areas that none of us want to be transparent. What did you have lunch with? Where did you go? Your hospital. All these things, what we really mean is normatively sanctioned transparency. And there are ways to do this. Large language models present a very separate problem because in most countries, the technical version of trust is, you disambiguate the data and show where the data came from and how it was used or misused. That's not possible really with large language models. And I think what you're going to find is regulation at the point of use. So you will end up having to show the results that you've generated with large language models, recalculated against the distribution of inputs. And then you can create transparency. I would say one of the under, just in general, when people say trust or when you talk about emissions or there are really two issues. There's the technical issues which are difficult but where I can tell you how you could do this and how we do it, which may not be the same. There's a politicization issue across, call it, the places where we're palatable, countries where we work. And that often means you could have the right answer but people don't believe you. And that issues harder to actually settle. I would say, but there again, what I think you will find is places that have a way forward like USUK Emirates are going to very strongly outperform places where the way in which this becomes ideological is dominant. And so I'd say, you know, we overuse feature bug analysis in our business. But the bug side is you can be right on all the issues and still lose the public debate. The feature side is the closer a culture or country gets to the point where these things are actually quantifiable or non-ideological, the more you will outperform. And I think this is much more a concern not for the Emirates or the US but for other countries where we do have very political or I would say, politicized dialogues. But in the end, at least in America we do, the commercial reality that this is driving growth and there are solutions. Now, on the AI front, you do have this large language models. Will this be a threat to civilization issue? And for those of you who haven't watched my innumerable videos, you're welcome to watch them. But my basic belief is it is a dangerous technology but it must be used in a war context because I want America to have the end of the day, I have the dominant weapons of war. And so that's my position. Excellent. So I mean, you're touching on to some things that I'm not going to go down but I will say humans and AI. I think this week I've had a lot of people having conversations with me, can the AI give me a button and do my job for me? And I keep saying, well, I want the AI to give you insights to help you use your brain and do your job in a more efficient way. And be creative, that creativity that you touched on at the start is really important. But I'm curious, what do you feel looking forward with your knowledge of the past and where you are today and where you think we're going? Is a human going to continue to be in the center of AI development or only in the center of AI development in certain areas? Well, I think the real answers we don't know yet. But and I also think in the near term, it will depend what job you're doing. So like, I think what you will find are petroleum engineers are still using their brain for a long while to come. But more precisely in a kind of more enhanced way. And that in the near term, what I think you will find is a lot of the things you hate doing, like recalculating things because the underlying data is disparate. The calculations are in one database, but not in yours. It's much more complicated than people understand because there's facts and other safety issues. You have to begin to measure emissions both in the terms of the engineering products you're using, which create emissions and the emissions costs of extracting hydrocarbons and they're processing. These are all engineering issues, some of which are really interesting, but some of which you really could. You could have valuable AI tools and outsource much like you can already write code more efficiently. It still needs to be code checked. So an engine you can make an engineer much more valuable, but you that engineer if they're very talented and you can make an engineer in the code writing case who's maybe not first rate generate much more valuable code that can be checked by someone who is. Also on that, you may end up getting to do things that you know you just quite frankly are slightly sexier. And the or like you will actually to your original question be able to push back against people who are saying well your emissions profile has gone up with quantitative results. And that really track back to the underlying data inputs to the smallest level. Which by the way if you're an engineer you maybe that helps you mostly around your home table. You know it's like when your son or daughter or cousin asks you what are you doing on emissions. And you have an answer that is very very strong and that that actually by the way will help with it you know like in the end. Oil gas industry like the software industry relies on talent so talent acquisition and retainment is one of the biggest variables in both of our industry and quite frankly this is one of the things that people have never understood about and it's like well you don't care about the character but you don't care about human rights. Well first of all it's technically beyond ridiculous clearly the person has not spent any time looking at the products or can't but still has an opinion. They probably work as an analyst. There's some very some of my best friends are analysts. And but it also could be that it's it's you need a reasonably quantitative way you you can win the debate with people who are quantitative. And by the way that's more important than it looks because those are the people you actually want so we even Silicon Valley historically has hated us because in the beginning they're like well why are you attracting and retaining the best talent for something. That's unimportant like saving the world when you could do consumer internet and make the world worse and we all get rich so of course they they hated that they there's like. Carp is a magician he's like the pie pieper of talent and instead of building yet another website that divides us he's building something that you know but in case but and then internally people are always unhappy with the brand because I stood up for our soldiers. And quite frankly that maybe we should enforce an ethical but definitive border which seems very controversial to some but any case the but I would always say and I believe this if you provide a quantitative response to non quantitative attacks. That is the single best way to make sure the people you get are the best people because they are people who think for themselves and you've armed them with real non-gingoistic non idiotic answers and but you really do have to do that and then you get you attract and retain people that you can empower and the empowerment point. I will make each individual technical and user more valuable and they will know it and they will demand more empowerment so like it is going to change how people are managed on the front line especially the kind of people who are technical because your industry. Like all industries that rely on technical people are competing with other industries and they're going to say the best people well I am very interested in this but I want the flexibility to actually do a b and c by this I don't mean a beanbag in their office I mean the cognitive and creative flexibility to do important things which AI will enable. But you will that's the way you actually are charismatic to these people and not charismatic to people who really would prefer to win battles with other people who agree with them which is you know is a thing. I agree it's it's not interesting having a conversation with someone who thinks the exact same way as you so. What about ethics let's move to ethics around AI do you have ethical concerns over developing something that by your own admission I don't know exactly where it's going you've said perhaps it can be it can be existential to humanity but. Well I do I think it's a real problem but I I guess my purchase I'm not expecting everyone to agree but if I think if if America doesn't develop the deadliest weapons it's adversaries will. And I I'm not I don't think everything is right about America or allies I could give you a long list of things to fix but I prefer our in general a a rule of law. Kind of high ethics I would say environment and I think those are the choices and I don't it's like I don't like these choices but I think it's it's hard at least for my purchase to ignore that those are the choices and I definitely and we a pound here made a choice now if we could get world peace that was enforceable in some way I would be very in favor with of like regulating these things same way we did with nuclear weapons. I think it's going to be very hard to reach consensus on these things in the near term and I'm very skeptical of people who think we can you have something you know primarily elite schools in America where people believe we're all going to ipso facto wake up and be. Neocontan Americans I just think that's one of the more it's it's amazing to me that that view is so charismatic because I I've never seen any evidence for it but it is a view that people have I don't have it our company we've been at this for 20 years we never had that view we built software systems for a a turbulent complicated engineer driven acceleration accelerating world for the last 20 years and we're seeing increased. So I feel very much like when I was talking about these things even five years ago definitely 20 years ago it was like get this person off stage quickly and there's still some of that thank you for not having that vibe but I think it'd be hard to say that you know a lot of things we were saying 20 years ago look pretty pretty obviously almost right now and then when you just look at the engineering the products we built are exactly built for the industries that are and government functions that are the most important including obviously yours where there's an ethical where you have engineering complexity and ethical complexity I don't mean ethical complexity in a negatives I just mean the the demands are higher they both increase and we're going to have a lot of things that are going to be very difficult to do and we're going to have to do that. And these complexities are more factorial than it's not that they're increasing by by 100% means that your complexity is increased by 100% it's more like a factor or relationship and you really have this issue where for example everyone here mostly engineers are like go of course policy people don't really often completely appreciate how something can be done. There's going to be a linear and exponential or a factorial growth pattern and the impact that will have on their lives and that is when you talk about trust there's both what you do and then do people believe you've done it do people believe this is hard to do those are those are very very different things and that you do have a clash between policy hardware software that is playing out where the complexities involved are just very different than the end users whether it's a good thing. Meaning consumers who want to buy a hybrid carbon product with low emissions policy leaders that want to have ethical versions of dealing with engineering issues but also ways that they can explain to the people who are voting for them engineers who are pulling out their hair saying do you know what you're asking for who are already dealing with like you know safety and efficiency concerns and it's a wild world. Absolutely it's a wild world and it's it's compressed everything becomes short sound bites you know messages that don't really address the complexity that we have in the world today like transforming one energy system onto a new one but I'd like to wrap up we've just got a couple minutes left and ask you you know you're very passionate about what's been built up in the U.S. and why why why the U.S. is fantastic a breeding ground for innovation and technology but here in the UAE the leadership of the UAE has really embraced technology I've lived here for about a year and a half now the willingness to take on technology drive it forward bring AI into the center of everything in the country and it's really because of the foresight and the financial support of the country's leadership but what lessons can the UAE learn from the U.S. and from the success of coming up like volunteer. Well I should I mean first of all a lot of people could learn a lot of lessons from tech implementation here most of my experience like I've been coming here for a long time and the people you interact with here below the hood are actually engineers or they understand what an engineering process would look like so I tell people all over the world you know this is definitely a place to look at if you are you know interested in the interplay of technology in society and then you see the you know developing AI models here has been done in a place where you can see the technology here has been done in a very efficient way so there's a lot to learn and I don't think in this context though I do believe there are other context around the world where yes people should come to America and I've told a lot of people this but I think this is a context where we can definitely learn from each other and so the the the American tech success story is just very hard to understand why at least in software but I think that's a volume is topic I would say though again I've I've had very productive interactions here over a long period of time and seeing people implement very complicated things efficiently here and so I have a very high opinion fantastic well thank you so much what a great way to wrap up an interesting conversation bringing it back to the UAE so thank you very much everyone for joining us today Alex it was a wonderful conversation yep thank you I really appreciate it thank you you
