TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

All right, I think we're ready to go ahead and get started. So welcome everyone to our first ever webinar focused on the utilities industry. I'm Becca Adair. I lead the operations for our work in the utility space and I'll be moderating this session. And I'm really excited to share what we have planned with you all today. So this will be the first webinar in our utilities series. Today it's focused on how utilities have successfully used Palantir software to mitigate the risk of wildfires, storms and other disasters. We'll also minimizing disruption for customers who rely on the grid through public safety power shut off or PSPS. So PSPS is a last resort option for utilities, but an incredibly important tool for them to have in their arsenal to prevent disasters. So Palantir has worked with multiple utilities on this topic to date, including Pacific gas and electric PG&E and Southern California Edison. So we have a lot to cover today. So our agenda will have three parts. One, we're going to walk you all through a demo of how AIP for PSPS enables users to forecast PSPS events and simulate their potential impacts across communities, infrastructure and essential services. Two, you'll hear from one of our longest standing utility partners PG&E about their experience working with Palantir on PG&E and wild on PSPS and wildfire mitigation. So three will end with a live Q&A. You can use that Q&A box at the bottom of your screen to ask questions throughout the session. So before we get started and our presenters introduce themselves, I have a few housekeeping items. First, this session is being recorded and it will be available for public viewing after the webinar. So we ask that attendees not record the session. If you'd like more information, reach out to us and we're happy to walk you through the material in one-on-one meetings. So while we kick things off with a few slides, this will primarily be a discussion and live demo of the product. So it's meant to be interactive. So please use that Q&A box at the bottom of your screen. We'll save some time at the end to address as many of your questions as possible. Finally, all the data you'll see today in the demos is notional. So now before we get to part one, we'll cover some introductions. So I'm going to hand it over to our guests from PG&E, JB, to introduce himself and his experience and then emergency response space. So over to you, JB. All right. Well, thank you for having me. My name is JB. It's short for John Birch. I've been working at PG&E for 12 years. And yeah, we'll be talking a little bit about how we do. How do you use this platform for PSPS? And I just so you know, I happen to also be totally by coincidence doing a project and an exercise where we're practicing a PSPS event this week. So that's why you see me in my EOC here. Thanks. Thank you, JB. We're so grateful that you're here. All right. Omar, could you introduce yourself and your experience working with PG&E and other utilities and then move right into the demo of a B for PSPS? Sounds great. Thank you, Becca. My name is Omar. I'm a developer deployed engineer here at Palantir. My service, the technical head for our work with utilities. Most recently, I've also worked directly with our engagement at PG&E and at other utilities. And I'm excited to show you what we have in store for today. But first, maybe let's get into a brief overview or intro to Palantir. Palantir rules decision making software for institutions ranging from the private enterprises to governments and in a variety of domains and industries. We will focus today's discussion on the utilities industry, particularly on how you can leverage AFP now for emergency operations, particularly for public safety power shutoffs. And I can see that we have a lot of partners are existing partners here in the room today. And it's also very exciting to see many new names and future partners. So excited to get started. So the first thing maybe since there are a fair number of folks on here's a brief on what public safety power shutoffs are. As weather patterns change and become more extreme events like heat waves, red flag warnings as a result, high wind conditions can spark wildfires. Due to a variety of reasons and utilities and their assets are also at risk of causing sparks or being damaged by them. Storms also pose a risk to the electrical or network assets of utility or other institutions. And so as a last resort, as Becca mentioned, utilities must proactively cut power. And while this is done in the extreme cases, it's imperative that this option exists to prevent catastrophic damage to life and property. This is public safety power shutoff. It is meant as a last resort, but it must be done efficiently in order to both mitigate the risk of fires. And keep up service reliability. And so as a result of all partnerships with PGA Southern California Edison and others and the technical investments made in service of a. Now we have funneled the sailing features of our work in the space to that is needed to stand up a robust decision making infrastructure for a PSPS into a product. And please don't announce the launch of AIT for PSPS a readily deployable suite of products that can be used to stand up and efficient and robust de-anization program. But in order to sort of like contextualize what it is that this product will do, let me run through some of the important pieces that that you may expect from a suite like this. First is reducing service interruption durations and frequency. So this is to minimize a scope of any de-anization to the absolute minimum so that you can keep your service reliability up to the point that it can be in these harsh conditions. Second, avoiding any penalties, minimizing any incorrect or inaccurate notifications, especially for medical baseline, access and functional needs requirements and any special categories that may be charted out by the regulatory. And lastly, but not the least important is streamlining the reporting and public outreach compliance with regulatory reporting is a must for a lot of utilities. But also to improve public and internal transparency beyond that minimum guarantee. These are some of the things that you can expect from this product and excited to show you today. And before we get into it, I want to sort of show where this has been in action. We have worked with several utilities, but some of the sort of deeper partnerships that we have with PG&E and something from Edison have led to amazing results in the deployment of the emergency ops technology suite, including decreasing of the acreage burned using the vast strip program reduction of the ignitions by 65%. And reducing the time that is needed to send customer notifications going from hours to minutes, which has resulted in about 60% reduction in missed customer notifications. These are the results that speak for themselves. And as a result of these these partnerships, we've been able to sort of distill the salient features into the product that you can access immediately. Alright, let's jump into a demo. Give me one second to share my screen. I'll get into it. Awesome. Can folks see my screen. Great. So today we'll show you a couple of different applications in the suite of tools that are available to you as part of the AIP for PSPS offering. The ones we'll focus on are the planning module and the public average portal. So first, let's contextualize what you're looking at. What you're seeing is the deployment of PSPS on notional and open source data. The first thing that a PSPS planning team must do is track the potential event that is going to happen as whether forecast indicate hazardous weather. So the first thing you'll see is the concept of an event and tracking one among many that may be of interest in a service territory. But as you do have several events, you're able to chart out specific plans for an event as needed. The planning app also allows teams to evolve their plans over time, whether moves, changes, and so should your plan. The intent here is to change and track those weather changes down to the specific assets that will be affected by the weather and the devices that need to be deenergized. Awesome. So the first thing perhaps to talk about is how does that actually take place? How do we change the plan? So the first thing that PSPS needs oftentimes are a set of admin parameters or program requirements that help you understand in what conditions should you deenergize in what conditions should you start monitoring something. The admin panel comes pre-populated with a default set of PSPS program parameters sourced from the regulatory framework in California, but it also allows you to edit and create new parameters as you need for your operations. And as you can see on the on the app, you can always go ahead and see how that parameter has evolved and have these be applicable, heterogeneously across your service territory. So perhaps there are certain regions of interest like high fire risk areas or high fire threat districts in some of the California verbiage. And you may want to apply certain rules in those cases, but not in others. And so the need to have configurable parameters becomes really important when you're defining a PSPS program back to the planning. So let's go to the real estate of this application. So the thing you're looking at is this map that is integrated in coalesced short term weather risk polygons from over time that are applicable for your service territory. So the thing that you're looking at here is a bunch of assets or circuit segments and devices. And so what you can do is look at everything that is applicable in my service region. So all of the assets that are relevant for me and my utility, but also the ones that are actually affected by the weather that is coming in. Let's move that. So let's look at the data that is applied against a composite risk score. So polygons that actually indicate what regions comply with the rules we just saw. So anything that has dead fuel in the form of vegetation or has had low humidity and low moisture content to having any other sort of risks that you may want to composite into risk polygons. So importantly, I can see this over time. I can see these blue polygons that are basically risky weather again that map to the rules that I have set either could be sustained winds high gusts high heat conditions that are moving through the territory. And it allows me to see what the scope of the plan will be as that weather moves over my service territory. So when an event like this is scoped, you can start to see the top level impact of that event and the current plan that you've selected among the ones that have evolved over time and see the notable things like how many customers are impacted. What do your number of miles for the organization look like and the devices and the circuits and obviously more are configured and added as a utility needs. Awesome. But that's not enough. We want to know exactly down to the device or the circuit how that affects the operations of the grid. So what AAP allows you to do is actually plan the de-energization intervals, the minimum set that is required to stay compliant with the rules, the program rules you saw and is configured by the planning team to make sure that you're mitigating risk while at the same time. So that's a very important thing to do is maximize the service reliability of those times. So these are basically the circuit segments or devices that need to be de-energized at particular intervals and you can always go ahead and check out what the start time and times and the particular customers that will be affected by this are. This is all backed by a lot of data integration that has been now templatized as part of this product. So that's what we're looking at before we move forward. What you're looking at here is a screen that allows you to peek behind the curtain a little bit and see for this PSPS planning module the application which is shared. There is a host of data integrations that is happening out of the box in the background. So let me go ahead in this app and select a certain sort of aspect of this application. I can look at all the different things that are sort of being used to come up with that part of the application. So there's full lineage to understand what your data is and where it comes from all the way from risk forecast and environmental risk areas to the de-energization intervals, the events, the plans, and then also other things like your asset information. So circuits in some cases, the overhead conductors, the transformers, the meters, the devices, all of this obviously is currently sourced in a notional way, but these are real world sort of data elements relevant to a PSPS program. I can also go ahead and maybe look at what would happen if I wanted to make a change which we'll see in a moment. But I can look at the approval and rejections of certain plans that AI people come up with. So having a human in the loop to basically make the final call but minimizing the surface area of the decisions that a human needs to make intelligently. Awesome. So let's go back to our planning module and going over this sort of view to see what is happening for our PSPS plan. I can see that the weather evolves over time and therefore my plans evolve over time. One thing that I might want to make sure is that I have a full understanding of the customers affected as that plan evolves, including a breakdown across common segments like residential, business, medical baseline, critical facilities, and others. But the thing that I likely want to do is avoid sort of working to approve plans that have already been approved again and again. So maybe the aspect of the plan that changes is not everything but only the part where the weather has changed or the forecast has changed. I can also again over time see the effects of those changes and bucket the any of the downstream changes into devices that have been added, removed or are in both of these plans. So this allows you to really compare plans as the evolve so that the human operator doesn't have to make decisions to re approve everything but only focus on the things that have changed. And as either the weather evolves or your program parameters evolve, you can always only minimize the decision making to that surface area. And when you do that again, this is only relevant if it's available to the operators in the way they make their decisions, which is typically approving the intersation intervals or at a particular device circuit segment circuit level. And here you can see that we can add that granularity define and sort of break out all the intervals that are being added, removed, modified and moreover, as the machine, as a if he comes up with these intervals and sort of decomposes them along the required granularities, you can always go into a particular interval and see what that looks like. So here I can see this is my single line diagram for the devices that are affected and I can go ahead and either approve reject or customize this interval. If I go ahead and approve this, this will now be removed from my list of things to approve or to consider it will be part of a plan which I can then publish and go forward with. This concludes our view of the planning module, what I would like to show you next is a public portal so downstream from the the effective planning operations that happen as the event is being scoped. If you for PSPS allows a utility to push approved and vetted plans to an outage portal and that can serve as a public interface for affected customers and stakeholders attractive event as it evolves. So here you have a tool that a utility can provide to their customers and allow them to sign up for alerts as as they see fit and I can look at where my PSPS sort of events are, how many customers do I expect over the horizon perhaps a week. So I will have a PSPS event and then furthermore go ahead and search for a particular zip code if I wanted to and go down to the level of the parcels that are going to be affected and be able to see on the level of particular parcels what my effects will be including the details of the outage the forecast that may be may be present at the time and the reasoning for the deanerization. So this concludes our demo of the planning module and the outage portal. Let's get back on to the slides in order to recap just the two, a bag of you go back to that. So this is sort of features that you get out of a a p for PSPS. One is the ability to integrate risk factors all the way from the short term and just in time compile risk factors to longer term risk factors and meteorology data and vinyl risks underlying risks any of these things that you would like to integrate into a program. So the PSPS protocol with a rule based sort of threshold based configuration or allowing an intelligent agent to allow to sort of generate the relevant additions and sort of look at hazardous weather and track hazardous weather for human approval and human tracking in the background forecasting simulations. So sort of of what would happen over time, including minimizing sort of the impact and sort of running what if questions against the evaluated service area that is affected and updating that dynamically. So as you evolve your plan and are able to update that you can also push that out to interfaces that matter things like of the sort of regulatory reporting stakeholder interfaces and customers. Great. So not it. There are further pieces that are being added to the suite, including additions to the planning module and several other modules that are coming up, including a communications module and execution one. These will track features like notification templates that map to specific jurisdictions. It could be either statewide or jurisdictional sort of boundaries that are created by the utility for their own operations integrating with sort of communication mechanisms that span all the way from SMS email to coordinating door knocks. And having an out of the box automation for regulatory reporting that allows you to do about 80% of what would be overhead work in order to report after a particular event and execution, including last mile sort of operations that happen with any de-energization tracking real time weather monitoring any activations and sending out any even at risk alerts. Great. Now we would like for this to be applicable and ready for you for this season. I'm going to give you for PSPS design to be readily deployable and can be can serve your organization this fire season, this hurricane season, this storm season this year. And not just this year, it can start as soon as tomorrow. We expect to be able to partner with you quickly to stand up a focused technology stack with this product very quickly and can help you mitigate risk and comply with regulatory guidelines. Some of the things that all of these things actually all of the requirements here are available and will be sent around in this slide deck for anyone who wants to get ahead and figure out how can they get involved quickly. But this is sort of giving you a sense of starting today means you're ready by June. And if you'd like to get involved, there are a couple of ways in which to do so. First, you can experience the product without any commitment. You can act using this QR code. You can get access to the product in a sandbox with the national data. Go through self driven walkthroughs, peek on the hood and sort of do your own sort of valuation of what this looks like. Or if you want to make it real, put it on your data, configure it so that you can stand up the relevant PSPS program or an operational sort of response to any emergency. Join a bootcamp and we can make this happen on the order of days. So now that you've seen what the product looks like, I would like to talk about our partnership with with PG&E with JB here. But right before that, I want to sort of like give a sense of what we've done at PG&E and then we'll go into the details with JB. We've been able to partner with JB and his team to build a very powerful wildfire management system within PG&E. So I decided to show you will talk about it today. PG&E's rapid evolution of their emergency response from a position of distress to being a leader in emergency operations has been made by deliberate decisions. So I think the 68% reduction in ignitions, the 60% improvement in customer notifications don't just happen. That is powered through data driven decisions on multiple levels. Thank you for joining us today, JB. And we're pumped to have you here to talk about how this has been relevant at PG&E. So we're going to start, could you tell us a little bit about where PSPS at PG&E started and what were the initial challenges with setting up the program? Yeah, for sure. So I think to set the stage, the emergency management in general at PG&E has been, I think if we kind of go back right before PSPS really started. It was, we were, we probably would have bragged, or been really proud to say that we were fairly electronic right that we were using Excel and email PowerPoint to broadcast and communicate and kind of work through any given EOC activation or emergency that came up. And then PSPS came to be, it was, it was, that's exactly how we started to approach it right we started to track everything in Excel, use PowerPoint to broadcast to the, to in words and out words kind of what we think is what, what, what our plan is what we're going to be doing. So, you know, looking back, that was, that was tough right and I think if you, you can imagine us trying to manage events that way and it's in, in, in, with that level of sort of what would happen is we would have have a really hard time actually staying on the same page for what numbers were true, how many customers were affected, how many miles needed to be patrolled. And, and in order to, that in order to sort of manage manage that risk with such a low level of accuracy and just inconsistencies, the resolution for planning the events would have to be huge. We cast a very large net we didn't impact quite a few customers. We'd have to really minimize how much we changed the plan because because of how hard it was to really communicate effectively. So our events started off being really large really long really kind of unacceptable right governor got involved saying like this is just not going to work. So, it was definitely not only was it an issue right for us to have to deal with from a wildfire risk perspective now we're really we're really upsetting our customer base the state. And so we were definitely in dire straits we hooked up with you guys tried that tried out PSPS and in foundry and it blew our minds. It was it definitely got us super aligned across the company about what you know what's the scope of a given event. And there was just no question everyone was reading off of the same page. And that that really trend like very organically transformed how fast we're able to iterate our plans how surgical we were able to make the scope. God are got the size of our events to be much much smaller help us identify exactly which customers to notify and as you were showing on those slides. Get the right customers notified every time we're like 99% plus accuracy at this point. So, definitely just that was the kind of the very beginning right and like kind of thinking through looking back it's like man we're moving at like light speed compared to the our previous approaches not even just speed but accuracy as well. And yeah, so that's that's I think that's kind of the beginning of of our journey that I'll start with there. And why do you think there was a need for dedicated tech here what about the relevant tools that the PG already had made it. So difficult to manage PSPS. Um. Man that's a good question so like. Again, I at the time I think we would have thought we were doing just fine right. And initially we we wanted to I think we already had some interest in leveraging a new data platform right and so like as we started to kind of look at look at Foundry look at Palantir. There was a big question about like what what should we do first. And it was just sort of like a light bulb like PSPS is probably the right thing to track for us to try really get right right it's got the big we've got wildfires like the biggest risk existential risk really to our company. So what would happen right what would happen if we actually try to try to a brand new data platform for something like that. So it's hard to say that like we knew we needed dedicated tech it was more like this makes sense. And then when we did it. It was like we we never looked back you know what I mean it's it's it's almost like yet to see it to believe it or something like that. But once yeah once we really started using it and saw how quickly we were able to iterate how tight we were able to stay out about the scope and just the numbers. It would just we had no question and what was it was great about it too is that it again it's hard to say we could have seen this coming but it got so much of our data in good shape right it had to be perfect in order to really work like work. You could have arguably tried to do that on it on your own right get your customer data perfect your asset data perfect but it's there's nothing nothing quite like a crisis and like a purpose that will help you get that really well well done. We I think we say a volunteer that crisis breeds clarity and and that has always been sort of forage in which some of our deepest partnerships have been made just because you need things to work and you need things to work quickly. So there are some of the things that that PG and uses from the sort of PSPS suite at from from within Foundry. Yeah so and I mean it would so like I was saying right the PS like doing PSPS forces to get our customer data in shape our asset data in shape our outage data and really good shape so that we could really manage these events plan the scope see things happening all all in real time. So once we had that in place and we're able to really broadcast into like really put on display for our company what this platform is capable of folks started picking it up and using it for other things around the same kind of wildfire management space so we have a department called the hazard awareness and warning center for example and they're constantly just watching for any kind of incident that any kind of an ignition that could be happening around our assets and at any time anything comes up they need to quickly communicate in a very clean consistent way to our executives about kind of what do we know is this us is it not us how big is it where's it going. And so they were pretty quick to pick up Foundry plug in a couple more data sources from really one of them is external right was as folks are just identifying where potential ignition happens and once every single time one of those comes in Foundry wraps around that any smart meter events that happened in that same vicinity what assets are around there goes satellite polygons all in like a very clean package for executives to see within minutes anytime anything comes up so that was a really cool thing that came right after after PS with with the Hawk team. We also started doing all of our wildfire investigations any within internally at PG&E using foundry and I think what was a cold example out of that team is it's all business like really strong data users but within the business that decided to sort of stand up their forms and their process and data management within Foundry as well. And so that was it's one of those cases where now like it's almost like the business feels like they've got control their destiny in a way right as opposed to being totally dependent on it to build stuff for them. So that's a really that's a that's a fun team that's in there and really in doing stuff. As we got closer to in into 2021 I had the idea to try to use it for an entire program as in like there was it was the program was called preventative fire retardant application and the concept was to was to drop by retardant underneath pre pre apply that are on our target underneath our lines for which basically would only last for one season and try to get like protect what we can before anything happens in case something does happen really. And so that was a case where we we just we come took the entire just like with the demo you just showed a minute ago we scoped out where we're going to be doing the work identified what agencies and customers that we needed to be reaching out to to get their approval for applying the this stuff. And and once we documented and showed that we had those approvals which is fully traceable. Then we were able to deploy our folks to execute and do that application and we showed where where that was also completed so we saw if we were able to get all of our reporting out of the same tool. It was that was a really great example of a case where we actually just took the took everything from suit to nuts as opposed to just like weaving in one aspect of of of an existing program in the into foundry. So those are a couple of cool examples of how we started to use this this that seated PSPS data and and add in other things and do kind of similarly cool cool things to help manage wildfire risk. And since you mentioned some of these other programs is PSPS the still the first line of defense what is PG need use to manage electrical outages and also just generally emergency operations the context of wildfires. Yes, I mean good question. So as you can see right on we're actually here still practicing right PSPS it's still really big deal it hands down is like tried and true at this point and we feel really good about having this tool and our toolkit. So what what was what I would say is definitely hands down changing the game is is our fast trip program though and that that is that is made a huge difference in how many what how many conditions are occurring and not only that but the severity of those ignitions as you mentioned the fact that acreage burn being in that 99% production it's insane. So so harkening back to that fire retardant program that we that we started to do. In the first sort of month that we were running that program it happened to be the same time that we decided to activate the hotline tag on about half of our high fire risk area. And so as we're I was sitting there running the the the the PFRP and I look over at the wall that we're using to track all of our metrics and a month. It would basically a month after we started doing PFRP I noticed that the ignitions that happen over the month of August this is back in 2021. We're down to eight and every other year before that we're in like the 30s and I'm looking at this and like something just change what what is what just made this massive change is obviously not we had not applied nearly enough fire retardant for that just to be the case. And and it was the faster program hands down and of those eight ignitions that occurred only two of them occurred on the areas that we did the hotline tag so we could tell something was. They totally making a change. And so at that point I took every resource that we had access to and relative to foundry and volunteer and just directed it full force at EPSS which is what we call the faster pro enhanced power line safety settings. And what was cool about that timing too is not only PSPS but all these other programs started to get implemented in the foundry which pulled more and more data into the tool and got it cleaner even more more chiseled right. The stars have basically aligned for us to for you to use the platform for the faster program because it was even it's it's even much more broad than just the just PSPS which is kind of a planned isolated thing. EPSS as a faster program ends up being really kind of like how you run your business in general so you have to have engineering involved you're doing a whole lot more you have to watch the grid as it changes every single day. And and all that was ready for us to start using so yeah it's I would say EPSS for sure is is is is changing the game it's you know what we call it's part of what our our layers of protection which include PSPS. I mean there was really great for us to kind of work our way through it right PSPS first start to kind of expand and explore get much data as we could into the platform and then really hit our with EPSS. And you're sort of team up the teaser for a future webinar that will be focused on the fast trip program that again has seen application across PG&E and so far other partners out west. So I think what would be good at the stages if we move to crowdsourced questions and basically sort of get from everyone who's attending anything that you would like to ask about the PSPS offering how it's been applied at existing utilities like PG&E or otherwise. Okay, thank you both JB and Omar I'm sure everyone's going to have a lot of questions based on that really powerful discussion. So now we will as Omar mentioned transition to the Q&A portion of the session so please everyone post your questions in the Q&A box in the bottom of your screen there. And we'll get to as many as we can in the last 15 20 minutes. So we'll start with this first question I think JB this would be a great one for you how long and hard was the process to improve the data quality in order to get it working in the the Palantir solution was the was the data cleanup primarily internal or was Palantir involved. I. That is it is a good question is the question really when it comes to using these data platforms like because you do you would think you know you could just just fix your data on your own like what do you what do you need this thing the new data platform in order to do that. So Palantir was a huge partner for us for this though honestly this is one of the court to me one of the things that really differentiates the company from from any other like business intelligence or data platform type of a company. So I'm going to go no quick little tangent story here but but my my experience and exposure to Palantir was actually a little bit more akin to like a kind of like a CS Lewis approach if if you're familiar with that author he was an atheist that was kind of out to prove that the Christianity or the Bible was all wrong and then coming and insanely like a you know the other side of that. It's a great question. I'm not an absolute force for for that for that religion and so I that was me right as I saw as I saw Palantir and found out I'm like oh my god another flavor of the month here comes another like like you know tablet want to be type of a thing and I was actually how to get a deep funded and kind of out of our portfolio. And so I but I was like, I got to make sure and understand what this thing is so I spent a weekend when absolutely that's learning how this tool works what kind of data was in there. That's where I stumbled in a lot of the stuff that we had already been pulled in in order to prepare for PSPS. And fell in love. I mean, this thing, it was an absolute game changer. It's, I could see how traceable all the data was. I could feel all kind of the scars and things that have kind of made it better as they've kind of worked through a lot of their prior work before they got to us. And so it was really the opposite. I called up my officers and I was like, we got to keep this thing on the right. Rails is going to change the game for us. So I feel like that's an important thing to sort of like, it's like to set the stage and be like, okay, this thing really is going to change how we do our business. But exactly to the point of the person that asked this question, the data quality really has to be there. And so I think it's key to be like, to be focusing on a real problem that you need to solve, right? PSPS was it for us. And so you already kind of know what good looks like. You know what you're trying to target. You know what it's supposed to say. And then you've got to have all the right leadership, data, stewards and smis and people that understand the platform, we're involved at the same time. And again, just to say like one of the things that I really appreciated about Palantir is they jumped into the trenches with us, right? They sent their implementation team into our company. I think we had something like 20 folks on site. And right there with us at the very beginning of all this. And we really couldn't have done it without them, right? I think that's just an important thing. I hate to say, I don't want to like, you know, I'm not, here's like kissing up, right? I really, it really was a big deal to have folks that are not only just insanely good with data, but we're willing to get their hands dirty with our data and help us understand how to transform it and use it for those things. So that's how I'll answer that. Unless there's any follow up, I think I should do. You guys think I should do that. No, so thank you, JB for the kind words. And really, these are the partnerships that have allowed us to sort of, as JB said, be on the front line of whatever is the most impactful and real problem to solve. And as a result of these, we've gotten the reps with partners like JB and incredible partners in other utilities as well to actually like build a framework around the product so that we can do this quickly yet again. And that is what has led to today and the launch of a productized version of PSPS where we've seen and gone through the, the end version of tracing models and how you can get weather data in all shapes and forms. You can have points that from weather stations that need to be interpolated to rasters and polygons and vectors. But all these things, having learned these lessons multiple times over, we've been able to encode that into a product. And so I'm super excited to sort of like go beyond to the next story where we have perhaps fewer than the 20 people that initially embedded with PG&E and do this in the order of days and weeks as well. So this is super exciting. That's my sort of add on to the same answer. So Omar similar to that, like looking into the future, like what if a person on the caller utilities doesn't have like same shape of data of what we would expect. Yeah, that's a great question. So as part of, let's maybe get a little deeper. As part of the, the investment made to bring sort of like the launch of this product and AIP now in general, we've invested heavily into tools that allow us to get from source to ontology quickly. And the ontology if folks aren't aware is basically the way we model our world. And that sort of sort of powers the applications and the operations that you saw today among both utilities, but also other industries where we're deployed. So tools like pipeline builder allow us to sort of develop and sort of templatize these pipelines and package them up with optionality at the start of that pipeline. And AIP allows us to recognize the shape of the data and pick up the things that we need. So it doesn't matter if you're missing say a column that you did here or your column is call something else, we have sort of encoded that down, especially with AIP and sort of generative models are able to now encode those into pipelines that can get you to a PSPS to be zero very, very quickly. But that's not all. The way we still like to deploy is be on the front lines, albeit not in the 20 person version, but we will do it within within a day will come and will work with you. And so that's what the boot camps are organized for. The intention is to really deploy the product show that it can work against the disparate data. And it's really something that we can talk about it all day, but unless you see it just like JB said, it's hard to actually believe. So I invite everyone who's on the call and I see folks who I have chatted with previously to get to a boot camp. Thanks so much. All right. Another one for you, JB. Excuse me. When implementing like a system like Palantir's, how much involvement do you feel executive leadership will be vested in a solution like this? It's key, right? You have to have it. I think when we did it with PSPS, we had a perfect like complete alignment all the way from the top to the bottom on making it real, like pulling it off. And it was like, it was passionate. So like it, I'm trying to think of like our, I wish I could say names, but the instant are incident commander, EOC commanders that typically run events made it super clear. We are using this tool, right? Let us know if you're running in any issues. And that's in, but it was like no question as opposed to be like, hey, try it out. If you don't like it, you can go back to Excel. Like if someone was running around with an Excel spreadsheet or a PowerPoint after we're starting to do this, take this leap, it was like, what are you doing? Like you're, you're, you're taking us the wrong direction here. And that was coming from like VP, senior director level, which is, you know, important for sure. Once we really embraced the platform, really right after sort of the PSPS proof of concept, we had a C suite level steering committee for any project that we took on with Foundry. And so that, and again, that's like, that was several people in the C suite getting together, like evaluating which projects that we need, that we're going to be doing, approving them, and then making sure that they had line of sight every single month to how those were going. So that's absolutely you have to have that have your leadership on board and pushing it, just as much as the, I think the people, once folks get their hands on it, like the doers, it's less, you know, it's a little bit easier to convince, less of a kind of sort of cells itself in a way. And so once it's really once you have that leadership kind of pushing it for any naysayers or folks that aren't as data oriented, that helps get everybody kind of stay the course and actually pull it off. That makes a lot of sense. And so who is like the typical user for the like actual product or applications? Man, that's it. Is that from me or Omar? For you, I feel like for you and then Omar, he has thought you can do it after. It's just the typical user. Man, so I, so I don't want to say, I don't think I should say I'm the typical user, like that persona, because maybe I like to think I'm special or something, I don't know. For someone like me, I take the platform and I sort of bolt it on myself, like I'm sort of Iron Man type of a thing. It makes me, it makes everything I do faster, better, easier. I think a lot of your more typical users are going to be folks that are just trying to get a sense of what's going on. They're looking at sort of like dashboards reports, they want to see what the scope looks like. You want to see the flashy map going back and forth like Omar was showing before. You're less, you're going to have a handful of folks that are going to be much more technical in there that are kind of behind the scene. So I like to think of it almost as like three levels. You have sort of your much broader base, folks that are just sort of like your tire kickers, the curious folks that want to see stuff. You have kind of that middle level of folks that are just dangerous enough on the business side to do, to build a couple of cool things, kind of like mid-level applications, things that are fairly functional, and kind of like meet that need for that individual business group and have the potential to scale. And then you have your sort of most technical layer, folks that are probably going to be more in like your IT department that are familiar with like writing all the Python, setting up your sort of GitHub data or code repositories and like standing up much more complicated applications. So I think that's probably an easier way to answer that question of like sort of like three tiers of users. Yeah. And on from our side as well from experience both in these larger enterprise contexts and in the context of deployable products like the one for with a P for PSPS, there are a wide set of personas that are applicable in any product, but these can range from the analyst like you said, JB that may sit in cross functional teams to integrators of data, but really the intention is to help get to operational decision making quickly. So that's the that that's strata of users are the ones that we are particularly sort of targeting and to enable those folks, especially in the context of sort of rapid decision making as is relevant for PSPS. So think EOC like emergency operation center users, sort of regional VPs of service territories down to sort of risk analysts and meteorology teams. These are the folks that we sort of cater to with this particular product, but in general, there are several folks, including partners with an IT who think about managing a platform, but obviously in the context of a product like this that is targeted for use case, we typically are thinking about how can the business get to the decisions quickly. And the context of PSPS really getting there before the fire season or the hurricane season or storm season. Thank you both. All right, got another one here. How does Palantir incorporate spatial data? Maybe start with you, Omar. Yeah, great question. So the I can give a technical answer here, which is basically we have built over time connectors and encoded our learnings on how different kinds of either data product information transfer protocols work or data formats work and a chief among them, especially as we're working in sort of geospatial planning has been all the formats that that accompany spatial data. And so from the point of injection and the connectors that are relevant for sources of geospatial data through libraries and modules that allow you to transform these between say projections of sort of geospatial information through to how do you make sure that those are sort of relevant and filtered to the right context to making sure the features that are relevant for say in area are encoded as properties to deriving further metadata from it. There are tools within Palantir with an AIP like pipeline builder that allow you to sort of transform this data. And then finally, the way we sort of display that also a comprehensive sort of map layer management application that allows you to store layers of spatial data and then render them in applications as you see fit within views of nouns like, you know, specific assets or events or applications cater towards certain decision making. So all the way from ingestion to data integration and transformation and application building that are catered pieces and features for spatial and other forms other modalities like temporal data. I appreciate you digging into that Omar. Okay, this is probably the last one we have time for directed towards you JB does PG&E integrate distribution management system, so DMS device state into foundry to reflect real time configuration to discern source trace or does the PSPS application assume a static state. So there, I mean, it depends right so the way that we've got it right now, we are actually just scratching was kind of starting to scratch at this real time sense of what's going on with our devices so describe what what I mean by that. Every day our GIS system spits out the tables that we would need in order to do tracing on the electrical tracing on the system in foundry. Based on how the system is built. So it's we call it as built right. Right. There we are currently building out a new DMS that we that's called ADMS that will that foundry will be able to tap into that data and start to see the real time like as switched grid and that that is likely as we're kind of watching that design happen to kind of fit really nicely into the same puzzle pieces and allows to see those those as switched. The grid tracing. So so that it's definitely coming and in the meantime, what we actually have been able to do is we are tapped into the current DMS system for very specific and like targeted things that we want to understand. So for our faster program program, for example, we we use foundry to actually generate the playbook asking operations to enable the device into into that fast trip mode. What we also do is we check what is DMS say after we've sent those instructions. So after the instructions go out, we can actually read back into foundry from DMS. Yep, it looks like they've switched that device on. We can see that in as we read that from DMS. So that's the level that is an example of how we're using it today. We we're excited about being able to see the great actual the tracing as it goes to as switched. And but we're not not quite there yet. I'm not aspect. All right, well, that all the questions we have time for. Thank you both. Thank you both, Omar. And JB for spending that time with us today. We'll bring up these slides one last time so everyone can see, but as Omar noted before, you can have like you can have a IP for PSPS in production by your most dangerous season for California that's wildfire season. And you can scan the QR code right here to get started. We'll send all this information out in an email after we close out today. So everyone who joined will have more opportunities to sign up. But overall just thank you so much for attending. We had over 100 people join, which is an amazing turnout and just a testament to all the incredible work utilities are doing across the globe. So as I mentioned up front, this will be the first in a series of webinars. So please be on the lookout for future opportunities. So appreciate you all spending this time with us.
