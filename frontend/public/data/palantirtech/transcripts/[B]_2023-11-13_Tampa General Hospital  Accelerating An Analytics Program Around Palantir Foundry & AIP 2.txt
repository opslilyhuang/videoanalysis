My name is Eater Hong. I'm the Senior Director of Analytics at TGH, Tampa General Hospital in Tampa, Florida. We are here today to talk about establishing an analytics program around Palantir, Stoundry and AIP. A Tampa General, we have a shared purpose and a shared vision around healing, teaching and innovating. We have an aspiration to be the safest and most innovative academic health system in America. It's a lofty vision that has really just started around six, seven years ago. Back in 2017, we've seen a massive amount of growth. In the short period of time, we've seen our surgeries expand out to 42,000 surgeries a year. We've seen our revenue jump from one billion to a little over two and a half billion dollars in annual revenue. We've seen over 7200 deliveries and our current hospital has around 1100 beds. We're in the process of growing that. Over the last several years, we've really transformed our organization from being a community hospital with a single hospital to being a hub and spoke model where we are expanding our reach for clinical care all through the Royal TSA to Florida. So we've got sites in Tampa Bay or Lando, Fort Myers, K-Coral, East Coast, Florida. What we're really doing is expanding even our foot with in Tampa. We're building out what we're calling the medical and research district. And so what started off as one site has now expanded into over a dozen sites throughout Tampa. And you'll see it in the map here. Tampa General Hospital was originally on an island and it's still this, but now we have freestanding emergency department rehab center. We've partnered with the University of South Florida to build a medical center, urgent cares throughout the city and the state. So we've been doing a massive expansion back in 2007 when John and Forest arrived. We went from 17 TGH locations to now in 2023, well over 150 locations. So you can see the expansion has been really rapid. And with that expansion, we felt the need that the Davis Island in Tampa also required some upgrades as well too. So we are in the process of building a 530,000 square foot ten new tower with 32 new ORs and an additional 144 beds. So the main campus will add quite a bit more bed. So this will become one of the largest hospitals in the state of Florida. And so with that comes a lot of tertiary and quattenary care. We do a lot of complex cases and we really want to expand on our vision on being one of the safest and most innovative by healing and defining medicine. So this expansion plan of course comes with a lot of growing pains as well too. It really gets to our analogue journey. We always look at our journey map by looking at the pre-John course in post. We look at the growth and the evolution of the organization and as you can see in the line graph here, the dark dots represent the organizational growth. Post John Corus, our new health system president, we saw a rapid increase in the organization as you saw in the prior graphs in slides. Just the physical footprint has grown but the complexity of our organization has also grown as well. And when you look at the green dots, that looks at our analytic capabilities and you'll see over the last five years that organization has grown rapidly but our analytic capabilities have not. One of the founding principles of our vision and our mission and the organization is competing on analytics. And in order to be able to do that, we have to have data at the table of every discussion, every strategic initiative that we do, every clinical decision that we're doing, that we would be able to base that off of sound data and be able to leverage data to drive decisions and better clinical outcomes. And so that first portion of it where you'll see the widening capability gap, we call that analytics hub 1.0, we recognize the need, we identified barriers in our organization and then analytics hub 2.0 is really where we start closing the gap. And that's really where our partnership with Palantir started and the reason why we went down that path. First, what I wanted to go over was some of the barriers that drove us to identifying the need for closing that data gap. And so we identified four primary barriers. One, we didn't really have a comprehensive analytics BIN AI strategy. Speed to market was a struggle for us. It was a lot of point solutions out there and a lot of capabilities but they were all disconnected, they were siloed in their respective areas. We had a lot of garbage in, garbage out and we had challenges understanding and analyzing the data that we had in front of us. And so in order to address those things, we really looked for a partnership, not just picking something up off the shelf, but we were looking for a partner that really understood data. And so with that, we set together a strategic vision around people, processes and technology with technology being probably the least important. However, for us, it was integral for us to create the right foundation. And so when you look at our technology vision, it starts with data infused everywhere by creating the connected health system. And what that represents is there's data being collected at every part of the care continuum. Man, as we're collecting that data, what we want to be able to do is take that data, get all the insights from it. And then what we want to do is complete the circle, bring that insight back to the clinicians, back to the operators so they can run the health system better, more efficiently, more cost effective, so they can treat our patients more effectively as well. We want to reduce length of stay, we want to reduce mortality, read missions. So in order for us to be able to do that, we need data at our fingertips at the point of care. And so with that, we needed a modern data architecture. What we were lacking was the ability to connect data from all different sources. And what we also lacked was the ability for us to get that data in real time, analyze it in real time, get the insights in real time, and then deploy it back in real time. And this is really where we started looking into a partnership with Palantir. Foundry, it really acted as the operating system that connected everything and allowed us to be able to deploy. And not only real time data analytics, but also be able to infuse AI and ML into our workstreams so that we can enhance our decision making. And so we've created this platform that is good for our operations, our clinical practice, our finances, as well as our budding interests into research and bioinformatics. So in order for us to really get the buy-in for organizational movement towards an analytics platform, we recognized some of the challenges of the past. When you have multiple solutions, multiple leads pushing an initiative, you've to find that our strategies and our movements become silent in many ways. And so what we had to do was we set up a functional structure and we pulled in all of our executive leaders in the organizations that here look, we need to really unify on our vision and our thoughts around governing a direction for this organization. So we set up what we call our executive analytics steering. It includes most of our executive vice presidents and our health system presidents. It was there where we presented an idea and a strategy around, let's unify all of our data systems into one, what Foundry I guess has called the operating system, have all the data go into one place and then feed it back out into all the various avenues, integrate it into our everyday workflows. And so we really subdivided the strategy into three subsections from that. Once we've identified the strategy and we said here, Palantir is the right partner for us. How do we make the data effective and how do we actually make change happen in the organization? So we have an accountability wing, we have a steering wing and then we have a governance wing. The governance really controls and helps us organize around garbage and garbage out, making sure that the data that goes in is clean and standardized so that we can actually take the data back out and leverage it. The steering committee allows us to be able to help prioritize all the various projects that we have and then the leadership governance is the third, probably the most important, it's our accountability vertical. As the data is coming in, we want to ensure that people are actually leveraging the data and that we're holding people accountable to it and so it's a unique vertical that I don't think is done in many organizations but it does allow us to hold ourselves accountable to the information that's at hand. So that between all three of those verticals, that's really the structure that we had to create and in order to push out a strategy that was centralized and effective. So as we built out the strategy, we also recognized that the partnership with Palantir really was a two-way street. We offered our clinical expertise in our operational expertise in the healthcare sector. Palantiric came in with their expertise in data architecture and the tools that would allow us to deploy the models and the data to our operational clinical teams. What we recognized was that with any effective partner, we would have to have capabilities that were built internally as well too and so establishing an internal platform team was going to be crucial for us to succeed that we wouldn't be 100% solely reliant on Palantir to do the development work but that we would be able to collaborate between the two parties and so when we set up our structure with Palantir, our platform team with Palantir, we recognize that Palantir offered expertise but Tampa General also needed to be trained up and to skill up in order to be able to communicate effectively and deploy effectively and so on the Palantir side, we have deployment engineers leads, we have engineering strategy leads, we have deployment engineers and data scientists working with our analytics leads. We have our data governance folks, we have data architects, data engineers, developers, analysts and data scientists and a critical piece for us on the TGH side was getting our integrations specialists involved in the project platform team as well. If our goal is to have a connected health system and to deploy these things in real time, it wasn't enough for us to develop solutions. We had to have the integration specialists to be able to deploy these solutions in real time so that the clinicians can see the information in real time. What I've highlighted here is our deployment project manager. What we found is you can build the perfect tool but if folks don't have the proper communication, they'll have the proper training and the proper educational and how to leverage these tools, we would fail at the beginning and so we are currently looking at putting together deployment project manager in order to make sure that these projects are successfully enabling the customers or our clinicians and our operators to use this. So establishing the platform team really came down to a handful of goals. We wanted to scale up and train our local team so that they could better collaborate and cross-develop with the Palincer team. We wanted the rapid iterative developments and that could only happen if there was good collaboration between our two teams. Real time integrations was really what necessitated the need for the integration specialists and then the data governance alignment was absolutely critical. We were finding that as solutions were built all over the system and we had products in one category and products in another category, if our definitions and our processes are in a line then we were going to see we would lose a trust of our customers because one system might say one thing and another system might say something different and so the data governance aspect allowed us to align our efforts between multiple parties and then I would argue leadership alignment was critical at the beginning stages of this that they understood the strategy that they would support it, that they would remove barriers for us and that we'd be unified that we wouldn't be fighting internally with one solution versus another solution that we had a very clear direction of where we were going and so that created the space for the platform team to really build out their capabilities. So with the internal platform team as well as the collaboration with the Palincer deployment specialists we were really able to push the boundaries with POP Foundry and with AIP now and so with some of the projects that we've done we're really proud of the very one of the first few that we piloted with Palincer around our Paki or our Post-Anastasia Care Unit. It's in that project where we identified the need for better data at the point of care so that we can make quick decisions around where to place a patient after their surgeries. We identified an opportunity that if the data was presented forward and a recommendation was made for where a patient should go that we would be able to reduce the time that they would be sitting in the recovery unit and so we did see a large 28% reduction in our whole time is there and then we also saw an improvement in the efficiency in planning rather than planning a few hours before now they're able to plan a day or a few days ahead. So that kind of built out a foundation for how we wanted to set up the other projects so as we set up more projects in Foundry we realized that everything is really connected to each other. A surgery project is connected to a staffing project that's connected to a care management project that one piece is in siloed in one solution in no another but that we could leverage data from one solution to another and so that really helped us actually during our hurricane response for Hurricane Ian we had built a few solutions with staffing with bed placements and with throughput and so those projects had development times of three months and on and by the time we hit the Hurricane Ian we said we needed this data and we were able to rapidly deploy a solution within 24 hours leveraging the ontology that Palantir provided for us the connected health system as we call it and so that allows for building out a foundation that would really accelerate what we are able to accomplish in a short amount of time and so we fast forward to our our investments with Palantir and Palantir's investment in the AIP. We had spent a lot of time using Foundry on the operational side but we look back at our vision and our mission of being the safest and most innovative and healing and defining medicine and we identified that we really need data to not just make our hospital more effective or more efficient we needed to make sure that how we care for our patients is the most effective way possible so moving from a purely hospital 360 view to a patient 360 view meaning the operations have to match the effectiveness of the clinical practice and so with AIP that opens us up to a whole world of opportunities the unstructured notes that a clinician takes those have been the holy grail of of health care a lot of the most important information is actually hidden in our notes and up until this point we haven't been able to unlock it until Palantir had pushed out AIP and we've been very fortunate to be able to work with the Palantir team to recognize the potential of AIP and so we broke out AIP into two different areas we know we're collecting all this data in the EMR whether it's clinical notes or medication notes or lab information we want to be able to use all the different unstructured data to be able to identify prioritization for our patients is the patient getting the right things at the right time as well as clinical appropriateness should they be getting what they are getting or they don't need it and you'll actually see that in our next slide here where we look at the value of the connected health system as well as us leveraging AIP you'll see that we tried it on a project that we had already started we have a sepsis care pathway management tool that allows us to be able to monitor inappropriate usage of antibiotics for a sepsis patient well we were able to identify was that there were variances in terms of when a patient should should really discontinue their antibiotics we I found that with our population once we pushed out Palantir onto that population we were able to reduce 13% time a patient is on antibiotics and so if you think about that that's a reduction in cost it's also reduction in the time that a patient needs to sit in the hospital when we average it out it was about 23 hours a patient didn't need to be on antibiotics and so that's a cost savings but more importantly it's a clinical appropriateness that can you imagine being on antibiotics longer than you really need to and this this happens quite a bit in health care there's there's opportunities for us to decrease the waste that we have and decrease the clutter so we did see a pretty massive decrease in a patient's length of stay about 30% reduction in a patient's length of stay which has cost implications not just for our health system but for the patients there's a lot of cost associated with every single day a patient is in the hospital on the operation side we've mentioned 28% reduction in the pack you hold hours well we also saw a significant increase in our staffing ratio appropriateness so the staffing ratio looks at the volume patients that come in and making sure that we have the right number of staff that are assigned to each patient we saw an improvement of about 84% in attaining the right ratio typically it varies by unit but we like to keep it from anywhere from around two to three patients per nurse we were struggling with maintaining those ratios but as we deployed the information on foundry we were able to really tighten that up but it went from being around two nurses short to almost perfectly balanced so it was a really big opportunity for us and then finally we're currently exploring some new use cases with AIP around our clinical documentation excellence are we capturing the right codes for being able to recognize revenue opportunities and so we're using AIP to scan through notes identifying if we've missed any procedures that we should have coded for or the other way around that we coded somebody and we which build them for it and it was inappropriate and so we do think that there's some dollar implications to accurately code for a patient as well as leveraging it for our clinical process improvement efforts so I wanted to be able to just emphasize we've hit a few key points in order to appropriately deploy an analytics platform at an organization and successfully do that some of the key success criteria is for us to be able to do that really starts with senior leadership buy-in in alignments if it's not part of the organization's strategy it will struggle in terms of deployments and longevity and in order for us to really rapidly accelerate our analytic capabilities really that alignment effort becomes critical the second aspect of a successful formula really is operational engagements what you build has to be something that's used by the folks making the decisions and the iterative builds that we did with Palantir and our team and the operations team really allowed them the opportunity to design a system that worked for them and it would allow them to create the efficiencies that they needed and then our analytics team having the appropriate training and appropriate skilling up to in order to be able to work closely with the Palantir team and to help with the deployment and then we had mentioned as well the integration team is critical for that we can build solutions but if we can deploy it in real time and the data is delayed it becomes use not useful really quickly and so that integration team becomes a very important aspect of our deployment team so what we want to wrap up with is with all the kind of various components this really creates a strategic roadmap for us and how we would be able to leverage data and be able to compete on analytics when our clinical care and in our operational efficiency
