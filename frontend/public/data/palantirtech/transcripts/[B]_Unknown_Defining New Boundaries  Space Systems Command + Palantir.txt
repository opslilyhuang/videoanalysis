TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I hope you don't mind. I don't have slides. I actually ban it in my office in an effort to make us more digital. So I'm just going to be up here and talk a little bit about kind of our journey that we went through as trying to shift to be more data-centric and what that really kind of looked like for us. So back in 2018 about the August timeframe, I was reassigned out from DC to Los Angeles to help this program. It was called JMS, which is a dirty, three-letter word in my office there. And it was one of those programs that had spent $800 million over 10 years and delivered one application that anybody wanted to use, which subsequently I actually redid it in six months for less than a million dollars and everybody around the world uses it. So at that time, they're like, hey, Jen, fix this. I'm like, okay, we're going to cancel it. We're not going to do this anymore. This doesn't make sense. And let's actually reevaluate the problem on what we're doing with that there. So space command and control. So basically that encompasses space-domain awareness and battle management command and control for our satellite, or satellites at the operational level. And what that meant though was I really wanted to take a, there's a lot of data out there. There's like, you have to be able to, a mass and pull things together to understand what is going on in the space domain. The domain's very big. There's a lot of satellites. There's a lot of debris. There's a lot of all of those sorts of things. But people were really actually looking at data as part of the problem. They wanted to replace this old and equated system that had been built back in the 50s. And that was their goal. So it's like, okay, again, reframe. We actually named our program, Kobayashi Marou. And a lot of that was, I am an engineer. That was a lot too. How do you flip the script? How do you actually get to win in a no-wint scenario, which is like, hey, here's a failing program, go win at it. And how do you end up doing that? And we actually were very software intensive too. So it's like, how do you reduce software in the government? Because typically the way we do it is, you know, we get requirements from a user over here. It throws us over the fence to an acquisition person. I'm like, okay, I think I know what you want. And then I throw it over the fence to a contractor. And then they think they built something 10 years later, shows up, and nobody wants it anymore. So that's kind of the typical cycle. That's not how I particularly operate. And so I am very much more about partnerships and about being proactive and actually having the communication and bringing all that sort of thing together. And what was becoming very, very apparent was, I needed to make data a part of an architectural element of my tech stack. You know, typically when you do it, it's kind of you get your hosting and your platform and your application layer. Nobody thinks about the data. Nobody thinks about ingesting it. Nobody thinks about what data sources do you actually even need in order to come to the answers or to solve the problem that you're trying to go after. So for us, it was like, okay, what is the problem? What is the journal you guys are trying to do with the workflows? What are you trying to digitize? What are you trying to automate? What can I do for you? And let's bring all that together and make data one of those kind of found resources of aspects. So at the time then, too, the midst of all of this, and I actually resonated really well with Dr. Carponeza. Like, give people no money and no resources. And it's amazing what they can do. So from, I had, when I, before I came into the program, they had about 140 million a year. When I got there, the like, you have 32 million. Okay. That's what a 80% budget cut. That's pretty sweet. And I had to do the whole transformation of the office as well as building new code, building integration, doing all of these, all of this, this, that and the other. And so I remember back in, I think it was early 2019, probably about the February or so timeline. And I'm at a data conference in Colorado Springs and I put data in parentheses because it was probably not how everybody here thinks about data, but they were starting to kind of talk about it. And I remember running into Sonny Sarkar and he's like, you know, we can solve this for you. I'm like, and I'm like, okay, because I also didn't have time. I don't like government loves to build things. They feel like if they build it, then that was the best product ever created. And you know, I can get that when you're trying to build a fighter jet. Absolutely. Government should build those things. But when it comes to a lot of the tech and a lot of, you know, IT or software, those sort of thing, I love to use industry. That's, you know, because everybody here is leading it way, way more than the government side is. And so I'm very much a proponent of buying versus building, especially when it comes to this world. So started the kick off that relationship then in the early 19 time frame. And in less than a year, we had operationally accepted our instance of Foundry, which we call Warpcore. Yeah. I'm going to geek. So what we call it. So Warpcore basically, we had that there. Well, the other thing is that I don't have money, right? And so I'm really big on how do I get other people's money? That's kind of a big tactic in the government. And so I ended up forming partnerships with a couple other organizations that would have to be North come. And there were the co-com. It's always great to have a four star general in your corner. And then I also established a relationship with the Department of the Air Force level, with actually the chief of staff of the Air Force level. Really good person to have a partnership with. And so at that time, there was this thing called COVID, starting to come through. And the chief of staff wanted to understand what is the impact of readiness under under COVID. Because it is like, there's, you know, all of these air squadrons are like, hey, we can't operate or like they weren't sure what was going on. I mean, all of this, not the other. And it was actually through some process network that folks realized what we were doing out in Los Angeles. And we had this contract. And we were already starting to do stuff with data and getting some interesting information about the space domain and what was going on there. And how can they actually leverage that to figure out readiness under COVID. And so with that, what ended up happening was, you know, I was only really ingesting space data. So that's kind of what I cared about at that time to answer those kinds of problems. The North come, they were ingesting some, you know, homeland defense kinds of data. And some of those data sets there. The Department of the Air Force is like, well, you know, I got personnel data. I've got finance data. I've got aircraft, I got readiness and maintenance and all these kinds of like, we need to pull all these kinds of things together too. And it was because then now we actually started to bring in all sorts of different kinds of data sources that neither one of us independently would have ever thought would have been valuable to the other of us that we were able to really get after it and understand a lot of different pain points and how to actually get after and resolve those sorts of things too. It kind of expanded our scope into realizing like, I didn't realize that, hey, this F-16 squadron over here, if I take school data at the time, health data like how hot is COVID in that area, if I take the personnel data for my airman and guardians and understand that, hey, this single mom who has kids and their school is closed and they can't have access to daycares, she's the only one that can actually turn a wrench on the F-16 aircraft and therefore because she can't go to work, that whole squadron has to take down, be taken down and can't deploy or do operations. And it was because we were able to pull all that data together and what seemed like a very disparate sets of data sets in their fundamentally came back into solving problem extraordinarily quickly or at least giving better insights so that decision makers could make more informed data driven decision making versus like the anecdotal kind of things where the gut feels that they had had previously before that there. So, where that is actually interesting because the government also loves to do taskers and they love to do them in Excel sheets which is again why I don't try and do PowerPoints and office products if I can help it because there was actually a tasker they were asking that same sort of question about like, hey, how is COVID impacting you? It's almost kind of a broad question like that and it took 10 manures, 10 manures of folks trying to pull all that data together in Excel sheets and then people trying to rectify it in there and that they did it, we gave it to the work core team, they found it out in about 15 minutes. So, you can imagine the resource savings just even asking one question going through there as to how that would end up happening. So, fast forward a little bit into the 2021 ish timeframe. So, we have this foundation where actually incorporating much more data sets, all of this out in the other, lots of people starting to ask questions, getting that extension of like, hey, this is the question I thought I had and then I got the data I could see something and like, well, what about this? What about this? And the power and the automation of being able to do that and actually expand your mind in questions you didn't realize you had and because now you can solve, because you can understand how the data is pulling together is also extraordinary, powerful, which within the 2021 timeframe, when we had to evacuate Afghanistan, that was huge. And it was only because of the foundation that we had there with work core and all of the data sets that we had in there because we were able to connect to other data libraries if you will rather quickly. And I think mentioned, you know, like the 22 hours from go time that we could have, we could evacuate the folks that we did in that timeframe. And one of the things that I'm very personally proud of and proud of the team, there are 15,000 souls that would not have been able to be evacuated unless we had had that foundation there. We'd already been prepping that battlefield if you will to be understanding where the data, where are the cargo aircraft, where are the supplies, who is, who is where? You'd think that would be an easy answer for us. Sometimes we don't always know. Like all of these pulling these pieces apart pieces apart together and one of my favorite stories is like, you know, as all of these massive families and everybody you're getting evacuated, you know, they're just first thing across to multiple different bases in the United States. And in a lot of cases we get separated. And you know, there are people who are trying to be digital, I commend. You know, they were doing like an Excel sheet to try and track people. And there was one case where there was one member who was up in, I tried to remember, I think they were up in New York State somewhere. And then we had another one who's in DC, don't quote me on the bases. But it was, you know, like father, son type of a team. And they had gotten separated. It was only because we were able to, because through the tagging and whatnot, through the connection, we were able to actually marry those two people up again. Which again, if we had been relying on the Excel sheets, nobody would have been able to have those insights. But because of that, we were able to reunite those families. As well as trace who had caught COVID in all of that, who was close contacts with that? How can we help there? How can we again get the supplies where it needs to go and do that and actually turn those operations within a very, very quick short time? So, like I said, that impact of what data and the power that data can do and how it can directly go towards impacting operations is, I can't even express it enough. And so it's actually interesting because before this, in the government, they didn't, at least in the DOD side, they weren't always looking at the power of data and what can that bring to the fight. And when you look at the way the world is going today and a lot of the threats that we see, you know, China is very, very real, especially in the space domain. There are on parity with us now for how many satellites are on orbits. They're in parity about how they conduct cyber operations. There's a lot of these things that are out there and the only way that we can actually continue our edge, if you will, or even surpass is if we can make decisions that much faster and we make quality decisions driven by the data in their knowing what's going on on their side of the world with on our side and then they can do that faster than they are than they can. And to be that's actually part of the thing that'll for probably some of the adversaries more than anything is that the government or the United States is actually, we embrace change to an extent, maybe not the DOD, but we do innovate. We do try and make, we try and do things faster and more creatively than a lot of other cultures that 50 years is fast to them. So I'm excited to see how our partnership will continue kind of going forward with it. Some of the use cases and the pain points that we will continue to use with all of the data that we're amassing through in there. The next step, you know, with joint all the main command and control and the fact, you know, we have plugs in with the Army now with some other whole government, how we can just evolve and be able to get after all those things to make sure that we can keep our way of life safe. We can keep it, keep our advantage both economically and physically throughout the United States and for much more years to come. So with that, again, I greatly appreciate everybody's time here and again, the opportunity to be able to speak. But for us, it's been very, very exciting and I'd love to see the leapfrogging that we've been able to do because of leveraging the commercial products that are out there versus I still have a team that works on things and they're still trying to develop stuff like five years later again still. So again, I greatly appreciate it. Thank you all very much and have a great rest of the afternoon.
