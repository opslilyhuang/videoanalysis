TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Obsidian just shipped a CLI with 80 plus commands and I tested every single one. Now I can talk to my Telegram and record a daily note to process this video later today and it's going to show up as a task in my daily note. I send a request to my agent OpenClore. It's working on the request and it just added this to my daily note. Now with Obsidian CLI, Cloud Code can check off tasks from your terminal, append content to your daily notes, analyze your vault to find broken links in one command, search, tag and query your bases. That's what they're covering today. All right, let's get started. If you use Obsidian for notes, this command line interface allows you to do it from a terminal or through agents such as Cloud Code. CLI is a command line interface and it's how it's working. We have a terminal right here. I have a terminal. I can type Obsidian and now I'm in this command line interface and I can look for tasks or bases. Here I just listed my bases or at least my bookmarks. There are none of them right now. Now this is cool that we can do that through terminal but what's even better that Cloud Code can do it for us and that's a unified interface for agents to access files, properties, search, get the tasks, analyze links for our Obsidian. Through this CLI, we are talking to Obsidian app. We can have access to internal plugin APIs or we can do any thing we can do with UI and this CLI is breached between AI agent and your vault. Now to get it up and running, you need to install Obsidian 1.12 and it requires a catalyst license and then in settings you can set up to enable CLI and you're good to go and right now any other coding agents can use it and talk to your Obsidian. Now there is a big discussion previously. Why CLI? Why not MCP? Previously what we had is we had a bunch of MCP servers. I had a local RSTPI plugins, Obsidian URI and it was just creating a whole mess that we need to setup this infrastructure to start programmatically, interact with Obsidian. But now we just got this official CLI from Obsidian team which unifies everything and just makes this access easy and here are the benefits. Previously people were trying to use MCP but now what we learned over the last couple of months that CLI is better than MCP. It's faster, it has direct access to your local files, it doesn't require any authentication, it's more context efficient and you can perform some fancy actions such as piping different actions and I think the main benefit that it makes it easy for AI agents to use this tool because what agent can do is to use this help command and it's gonna understand what is available. Those are all of the commands which agent can use and if it doesn't understand how command works it can essentially run this Obsidian help and it's gonna understand how to use it. It's a concept of progressive disclosure where we don't load like all of these tools, all of this command into the memory of the agent and we let agent to explore it on its own when it needed to perform a task and the commands which has been added are over 80 commands and they can be break down into several categories such as file operations, properties, search, basis interaction, tasks, daily notes and some advanced commands for developers and today we're gonna go through each of those categories one by one and explore what's possible, why does it matter and what's new, what are the actual use cases you can take away with you and start using with your vault with your Obsidian and the first one which I'm very, very excited and I showed demo initially at the start on how can you use your daily notes as an inbox for every device especially why this matters is because we can have a unified interface as a shot here with just a telegram inbox where I can just capture my voice notes or I can just take a picture of something and then tell the agent to use the CLI to append this note into our Obsidian vault into our daily notes it just reduces the friction between capturing ideas let actually test it how it works I'll run cloud in my Obsidian vault and let's try to do something here I'll just embed my daily notes for today that's my daily note and that's what we added already and what can we do here is tell let's say I want to append content to my daily note with some brilliant idea let's say and use Obsidian CLI that's a request to cloud code and now I put into the memory the way how to use the CLI it's gonna know which command to run so I don't have to to run it myself it runs this Obsidian prepend command with this content and now we got this idea captured into our daily note and here I'm just embedding this and you can just open it and that how it's working what we can do also is ask about the tasks which are unchecked for today now it's gonna use this command and it's gonna know that in our daily note they have this tasks which unchecked and it's gonna receive this information exactly and I can do the same myself essentially I can just open a new terminal window and just try it myself and I'm gonna receive this result but there is no need for that because cloud code is is so much powerful it is such a powerful tool that can handle those requests just add a click of a button and essentially it's just much easier to add tasks to mark tasks off using this way yes sure I want to mark this as done now it just use the CLI to mark this as done and that's how it works now you can scale this up you can hook up it into your telegram and just talk to your Obsidian at tasks ask about your current tasks or your focus is just right now available and possible with the current Obsidian CLI and there is no more context phishing you can just work inside of cloud code or inside of your or talk to your telegram but such as open claw to enable this unified inbox for your thoughts ideas tasks now this part is we what we discovered and that you can do a task management with the Obsidian CLI without opening any file and you can do quite advanced quite advanced actions here let's say I want to list my tasks which has a quick tag and give me the presenters as a table and this is very useful because now let's say I'm just a three minute I don't know spare minute and I want to check what are the tasks with a tag quick and what what what we can do right now okay cloud just got a bit off track now it uses Obsidian a while function that's for developers I wasn't expecting that is there a way to use a Obsidian CLI natively to accomplish this without evil it's just directed a bit and when you start using the system it's sometimes don't get everything correctly and you need to teach it on how to handle your request for example right now it just went about running this evil commands which we don't want to do and we wanted to do it in a different way and right now once we succeed we're gonna tell cloud okay I want to do it from now on in this way and add this to a memory okay so it tells me that there is no native support okay so let's try to do evil command okay it took us a bit of a time to figure it out but now we did it in a different way and now I can tell yeah I want to add this to cloud.md so that when I do this request we do it in this way and this is the point that the system is so flexible you can adapt it on the fly to your needs and make it truly personal now we have added this way to figure out how to get tasks with a tag now moving on to file operations that's a very important ability if you're using coding agents such as cloud code they typically use this command and then to move files on your world and that's a problem because it breaks backlinks in your obsidian and what cilai enables it enables to do this in obsidian native way such as if you were to do it for example rename a file here and right now it shows me that updated 14 links or if you move file in your sidebar to a different folder we can just test it by telling cloud okay I want to show if you can rename the slides to slides 1.md without breaking their backlinks now it executes this command let's see what happens uh-huh I didn't see the update here but the backlinks are preserved here as you can see and on our graph we can see that we are all connected that's one benefit and it works if you want to move file or if you want to rename I'll just rename it back on how it was and that's very very important to preserve integrity of the backlinks in obsidian and of course you can create files open files you can just test I want you to open I want you to create a file in our obsidian using cilai and I want you to open in a new pane in a sidebar this is the use case which I use constantly when I work with cloud code I I tell to open a plan in a new tab and that through it really helpful now it just created a new file with the content and then it opened it now so the main point is that now cloud code can properly organize your vault move files and it's going to be state healthy and now moving to the vault help I really found this very very cool possibility that now we can find the broken connections in our vault and this is very very hard to track because there is no I don't know of a way to do it in obsidian now I want I can ask cloud to find a dead ends for example or I can just execute it myself and here are the dead ends the files with no ongoing links or files with the broken links there you go here are all my files or find your orphaned and there you go here is just a bunch of bunch of files you can also do backlinks and it's requested the backlinks of this file which I'm currently working on and those are can be seen in your graph right here those are different sessions of cloud code and here is a prompt you can try to analyze the health of your vault and find that ends and it's going to do the search and propose a solution I want you to write a report and suggest the next step on how can we improve the health of our obsidian vault based on this information okay so we took a bit different approach we wrote the script by using eval command and agent found that those commands you're trying to run they're quite slow now we brought this command and here are the results analyzed by folder here all the dead ends here all orphans and unresolved links and here is a report analyzed by folder and suggestion on how to move on with this information because find for example fix unresolved links in this folder triage orphans in notes and this is what I need to go through on my own that's just an example on how can you analyze your vault understand what's happening what are the unresolved links orphans that ends it's very very helpful and you can design a solution how to go about it with the cloud code directly now and if you want to set it up in your vault I'm running a workshop where we do it together and you can find a link in the description where link off from zero to obsidian clipro in in 90 minutes check this out that's going to be exciting live workshop and I'll see you there all right now moving on to properties and this one is I'm I'm very very keen on using that because now what we can do we can use this cli to set properties such as status of our notes from the cli interface and that's going to change the front matter and that's going to be updated directly in obsidian UI and if you're using previously coding agents you know that context efficiency is what really matters to achieve good results in your work with agents and to make edit to a file agent need to read the file in full and then a change on a single front matter field and that's just huge waste of talking time and energy now instead a cloud code can do just this command set property to done and that's it it doesn't have to read the file and that's the beauty of that and that's something that wasn't possible before okay so let's actually try something here I just embedded obsidian base with the book marks and let's say I don't know I'll just copy those to clipboard and I want to change the status from unread to process can you change the status for those notes to process using obsidian cli now it should do it without reading the files let's just see they should just disappear uh-huh so it needs to find the file path that's the problem I see and now it runs on command to set property and it should they should just disappear uh-huh so it just changed it here I see now the status is processed and this happened without reading the the file and I just asked it to put it back that was just for the demo and then just doing it one by one and I think the limitation here that it's quite slow it's quite slow that's what I found a bit limiting here nevertheless that's very very cool and next moving to the search and tags and I find this useful to get quick information which you need and the examples could be if you use tags to tag your tasks I use a tasks I use tags such as quick deep or evening when I want to work on something and now with this cli I can essentially just ask a load to find all of my quick tasks or deep tasks and help me to get started to work on those okay so let's try let's try yeah I want to list all of my tasks which has a deep tag okay you know that's the believe what happens I've only run it first time that it doesn't get it correctly and you need to guide it through let's ask try to search deeper there are such tasks okay cool so what it does it just lists the files which has a stack deep but it doesn't find like those tasks it doesn't output those tasks let's say is there way to parse those somehow to create a table and now it should it should do it correctly okay I think that's not the right approach I would say let's do something different I want you to embed data liquidity into our outline you're gonna list those tasks and I think that's gonna be better approach we're gonna use data view and data view is a plugin that enables quitting your obsidian as a SQL database and here are the different different tasks we should have and now I want you let's say we can execute we can get access to those tasks using the data view commands you can essentially ask cloud to get it for us I wanted to use eval tool to get all of these tasks and command them at a table and let's use data view for that I think that's going to be better approach yeah now can you query this some information using eval tool and present those results as a table okay cool and here are all tasks with this deep tag yeah it was a bit hockey but that's possible that's possible with obsidian CLI and the point here is that once you enter the signal pane on how to get it for with cloud code you can make it a reusable skill or add it to your memory so that next time it's going to be very very smooth so you have to go through that at least once to make it work or teach it to do it in the way you want but after that it's it's just great next the basis and basis is something that I'm really excited about because it enables so many possibilities and let's try something let's say we have this bookmarks and we want to have to get a look at unread bookmarks you can just imagine that you have inbox and you want to understand what are the under it inbox items you have and with obsidian style you can just get those into cloud code and ask something about those bookmarks hey I want to use obsidian CLI to to query this bookmarks for unread view okay we are sending requests right now there is a year that this file has not been found so it means just provide a complete file path but cloud learns very fast and now here all of our bookmarks in cloud code present this as a table can you just make it more pretty now there you go and yeah you can query any obsidian base you have and I use obsidian bases all the time and here is the list of my obsidian bases can you query them here all of my obsidian bases for example I want to query my cloud code skills which I use or you can like ask about your journals if you have a base for journals okay we are querying this agent skill base it's a cloud code skills which I have and here are all of those results and now look at our context window we just got understanding of like all of this 70 files and the benefit of that because we are right now only reading the front matter varying this front matter which says so many times that we don't have to read like complete files which is such a waste we can just read front matter and right now me and agent are aligned because what I see in my obsidian is exactly the same what clouds is so we are on the same page and this is extremely powerful approach now if you put into your obsidian a structure the data maybe information about your meetings your clients your projects you can just ask about it in a similar way and it makes us less chaotic this is this interaction with a cloud code less chaotic now you are both aligned and you're both on the same page yeah and here for the bookmarks I found a very cool use case is if you are browsing something you can just put it into your agent here and ask to book market it's gonna use a bookmark skill which I have and it's gonna put it into this obsidian base and it's gonna appear right here I should see it right now let's see if it's gonna work and this can work with anything literally anything you can bookmark youtube video you can bookmark articles you can even do a picture of something and send to a cloud bot and I'm gonna put it here into the proper folder now the agent confused it give me it's it's read this link and then it tell me about the bookmark command interface but that's not what I wanted and here I need to be explicit to tell use a bookmark skill to put into obsidian base hopefully right now it would get it okay so my bookmark skill is not synced because open-claw right now working with my mark mini I think it's it's not getting synced and that's why it doesn't see the skill for a bookmark which you have on my mark right now I'll just copy it and okay I think a cloud bot just got stuck I think I'll let it relax in another case is a history command which shows all saved version of your files in obsidian and this is a command and by default it shows the the history of the current active file in your obsidian and you can see here are the snapshots and you can go back to any of these let's say I want to go back to version 15 and here is a version 15 from 3 pm today and you can analyze how your nodes are evolving in time using this command and here is analysis which have down on those slides that's a complete reconstruction using the history commands on how this outline for this presentation has been evolved and like here all of the versions version 1 to 315 and that's very cool and I love it that we can ask about this evolution I see many many use cases right here and you can track your version history without git and your agent can check of what was the state of the file before like a day before it can compare changes and you can ask about those changes for example what has been added to our outline from version 15 to our current land version if you can do it in a brief summary you can just ask about like those questions and you want to get an answer and that just very surprising that it's possible that our agent is not analyzing the differences and here is what like all the changes I added icons I added Y and demo blocks that's so helpful yeah that's very cool and everything I just showed you is building blocks you can connect them and you get your personal operating system up and running something that knows your context tasks your project and works with you not from scratch every time and a good line with code code on top of this obscenity line and if you want to build it together there's free workshop link in the description I want to know what command excite you most about and drop it in comment and I'll see you in next time
