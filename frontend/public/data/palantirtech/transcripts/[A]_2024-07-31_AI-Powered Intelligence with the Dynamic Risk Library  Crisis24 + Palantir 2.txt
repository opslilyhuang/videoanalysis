TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The technological growth is accelerating faster than ever, and we are engaged in multiple hot and cold wars for dominance in a shifting, multipolar geopolitical landscape. The stakes are high for both nations and businesses. In this game, complacency is devastating. My name is Chad Lesh, and I serve as Senior Vice President of Strategic Projects Crisis 24. My team has combined the skills of former top-tier CIA analyst, advanced AI models, and natural language processing refined by senior deep learning engineers using RGAR architecture. We leveraged platinum tier data providers and Palantir's engineers with Foundry and AIP software to release the world's best 360-degree intelligence solution. The dynamic risk library provides bespoke forward-looking intelligence, powered by AI, at a speed in scope that has yet to be realized today, enabling our clients to dominate the security, commodities, geopolitical insurance, and financial markets. I'm Ansel Stein, I'm the Chief Analyst at Crisis 24. You know, what's the superpower of this? It turns analysts into decision makers. Your team comes in on Monday morning and has to do a basically reporting scrub over the weekend. You're just spent a couple of hours just reading the news. What the tool allows you to do is sort through that relative to the countries or the issues that you are interested in and automatically writes a report that is in the style of the US intelligence community. It's focused on analysis, it's forward-looking. So then instead of having to do the summarizing and reporting, you're able to go off of the assessment. Intisputory Intelligence and Naval Strategic Decision make. Challenge with intelligence right out is we have an excessive data and a limit on human capacity. The real game changer with AI is shifting beyond the mirage that data equals power. So the DRL in a sense is about building what we call structured analytic techniques into AI, which can sift through and make sort sense of these sort of vast amounts of data. It will transform the intelligence shop from something that is just a tool of crisis response or crisis management and enable them to reach out and help other parts of companies make profound decisions that affect it. Hi, my name is Brady Maduros. I'm a technical lead at crisis 24. Palantir AIP is the platform that allows us to deeply integrate AI into our operations and our tech stack without being beholden to another company. The real Palantir differentiator is the ontology. How this platform enables us to wield our vast, complex and evolving data to create canonical views and intelligent applications in real understandable language. We're able to pilot with customers, iterate, and then bring back to the customer all within a week. What we've done is that we've trained large language models to think essentially like an analyst that goes through the process that an analyst would go to to identify if something is a frisk to a country or to a region. But not only that, we also have to use something called a vague architecture. And what that vague architecture enables us to do is to provide the LLM with enough context. So when it's providing that assessment back to the user, it has, it's not going to form any hallucination. It has enough information that it's able to provide cohesive and comprehensive reports that is of significance. We're able to extract relevant events that are going to be of interest to a user and show them that, you know, of the 10 million events that have happened in this location. These are the ones that are relevant to you. And this is how it's going to impact your day-to-day operations. We're in uncharted territory. What we have built literally does not exist on the market. Being able to be part of the team that is innovating and leading in this space has been an honor. By blending in a proactive forward-looking analytic approach, you're able to better hedge your bets. See the signal through the noise in advance so you can better position your company to accept whatever is coming into the future. Having that foresight is a game-changer for organizations, not just in the intelligent space, but in the business community writ large.
