TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Alex, welcome. It's a pleasure to be with you today. Happy to be here. Nice, very happy. I could spend time with you guys. And as Margaret and Richard mentioned, we're aiming for about 40 minutes now of Q&A led by me in 10 to 15 minutes of audience questions. So please do submit them and we'll get to those towards the end. Alex, a very simple one just to kick things off. How would you in under a minute describe what what Panty is, what Panty does? Well, first of all, I want to thank Richard for the very kind introduction, which means a lot to me and all of my fellow Pantyrians. Pantyers supplies world class software to some of the most important institutions in the world, especially those in the Intel and Defense world, America and its allies. And to commercial entities all over the world, the software is the underlying motor of their work. So it powers special forces, it powers a lot of the operations that are done, it powers the way in which intelligence and clandestine services all over the world do their work and core in correspondive civil liberties. And on the commercial side, there's a thousand applications for our that integration motor and the full stack of software we provide. The shortest answer is in a world where software is largely a complete and unmitigated disappointment if not disaster and comes in the category of useless or totally non-working. We supply software to the institutions that I think most of the people in this room believe support us, including the institutions that you run that is not only useful, but in the clandestine context often exceedingly useful both in terms of finding our enemies and protecting our civil liberties. So when you also just another introductory question, when you consider the growth in big data analytics in software more broadly, it's been huge over the last decade, it's been huge over the last year or two. Where are we on the curb of that? Are we in the first inning? Well, I think the way to look at this is we've gone through a number of industrial revolutions. And by the way, one of the things that Richard is essentially alluding to was that tech, largely American, often West Coast, but Midwestern American, where the dominant parts of it was both linked to progress for society and the creation of wealth. And so now we have this thing where software is really often very much linked to a couple small group of people on the West Coast getting wealthy. And you have where we are in the cycle is this to your question. It's we are at the way beginning of a disruption where software and its execution end up being the determinant variable of military clandestine and commercial success. And so what you had led by America, it was starting quite frankly, I would say with the Manhattan project, where we often forget we built the impossible in record amount of time with almost with the minimus resources and then winning the Cold War and then where but these things were often hardware, hardware, chemicals, hardware, nuclear hardware, something focused. What you had with you could call Silicon Valley or tech revolution, 2.0 is that you had companies mostly on the West Coast of America that are the very best at executing on software and turning your data into a product, a product which is so disruptive that they disrupt every company around them. And that that revolution is at the beginning because companies like the companies that are represented here and all over America and all over the world are going to implement software and combine their business acuity, their operational acuity and world class software in an effort to create jobs, wealth and prosperity and also to succeed in the competition of business. So I would say I think we will look back at this time as a converging point where software and where the hardware was used to be dominant now, the software and execution we done it. And what you're already seeing now is that on the military, especially military and commercial front countries and entities that are good at software have a just enormous advantage even if nothing else works. And clearly you mentioned all of the Silicon Valley growth in the last decade and if you snapshot the market cap of tech companies and where it's headquartered, it paints a very clear picture of the US lead in this tech innovation, software innovation of the last decade. Today if you snapshot what's likely to evolve over the next decade, would the US still have the same scale of lead over the rest of the world in terms of that level of innovation? Well, it depends. Just don't expect many people are actually tracking our company but you know it's like I think there's a lot of what's very positive in America is we were born in Silicon Valley. I think we were the first company of our size to move. We moved our head quarters to Denver. I think there will be a wider distribution of tech companies outside of Silicon Valley in America. But to your question, America is for lots of reasons the best at building software. There are other countries that do it very well. If you look at Germany has some strong companies, Israel is very strong in their other countries. But if you look at just purely on the old geometric of market cap, so the battleships of software tend structurally to be in the US. I think they will move from the West Coast further into the Midwest. I'm very happy with our decision to move into Denver for lots of reasons including a lack of a complete monoculture that you have in Silicon Valley that you don't have in other places. But there's an underlying question and said you're stuck with me for I guess a full hour. I'll just give you the longer exegesis on some of the advantages that America has in this one area. And by the way, I'm not saying in every area. I think there are areas where we're not particularly advantaged over allies and adversaries. But the soft, it's been interesting to ask why has America been so dominant in this one area? And I spent a lot of my adult life outside of America in Germany writing a PhD and then building our business. We have a large business in Japan. We have a large business in Europe and in some extent in other places. But there's a convergence of intellectual veracity, pragmatism and I would say Midwestern ability to do teamwork. Software is very much a team sport. It's a believer sport. So if you compare cultures, I know pretty well Germany, France. These are cultures with very, very deep engineering cultures, very, very highly qualified engineers. Mathematical acuity that certainly rivals in some cases better than what we would be able to produce. However, we in America are much better at having a crazy dream. Our crazy dream was as an example, we are going to give clandestine services and the US military the very best software in the world. And at the time, again, since you're stuck with me longer than you may, what? I'll just, it's in you may not the way in which software was procured in the US was they would give out billions of dollars for products that were built over years. And one of the really interesting things about software and one of the big advantages we have in building software in America is a lot of the common sense assumptions we have about software are just not right. So the common sense assumption that a lot of people had in the US government was if you spent $10 billion and you had 10,000 engineers, you would have a better product than if you spent $30 million and you bought it from a completely mad looking CEO and a motley crew of people that looked like their 12. And this is false. And you know, and so we got the US government to buy products instead of services. We said that you could solve civil liberties and self targeting in the same time. So software as a unique attribute, you can take two difficult problems that are contradictory and solve them at the same time like finding tariffs and protecting civil liberties like lowering cost and having better software. And so this, this, this, this, this, this like this ability. So then that brings me to a last advantage that I think gives America structural advantage on the software thing. It's, you know, where America is, has a lot of structural issues that, you know, get a lot of attention and should get attention. We're very adaptive. You know, if I compare this to other places I've lived a lot of my life, America is like the US military completely got rid of the way it's been procuring technology basically to buy technology more effectively in the period of a couple years. And it's like an amazing thing is like you've been buying technology in one way for decades. Along comes a, you know, a small company that says, look, we believe it's really important that we show you the software works before you buy it that you pay attention to civil liberties or as they call it outside of America data protection that you buy a product and not services that we can scale across all these things that we can provide certain kinds of security attributes you with instability of code you can't have with one off products. Sounds bonkers crazy and they changed. And this happened in a relatively quick time amount of time. So it's like I think America's going to do very, very well in the software front. Now, there's a caveat to your question, which is how does that translate into our military? And that in military and defense, having the best software companies in the world doesn't mean you have the best software in the context of the US efforts to defend itself and rival our adversaries, especially in kind of the AI context. There, I think America's made great strides and very optimistic, much more optimistic than we were years ago precisely because we've changed procurement because of the realization that people running these things in a clandestine military services realize that America can do very well and win. But not if it's bringing the, you know, 50,000 hours of services and that whole thing instead of rallying our very best of the best to our cost. Last problem before I turn it back to you, the real problem on how America does in that context also comes down to the unwillingness from my myopic perch totally impossible to understand unwillingness of a number of tech companies and engineers to support the US government. Now, I don't think everything the US government does is right. I don't agree with what things I'm a citizen like many people that I'm sure everyone listening. We have our aggressive agreements and disagreements. But the odd reality that many in Silicon Valley are not willing to support the US government in military context is something that should be a source of great discussion. And, you know, I for one always want to hear, well, if that's the case, how do you justify the fact that you're building your company in the US and driving on our highways and getting protection from countries that are unhappy with your encroachment on their sovereign be simply because they don't want to offend the US government and our taxpayers. So that is a really big issue in America that, many of our software elites have a very different view on how you should support the country that has supported us than say we do at Palantir and I do personally. I wasn't going to get to this topic yet, but I will and I'll follow up on what you just said. Why do you think that is? I mean, please call out some company names if you want to, but you don't. Well, there's a long answer. I think the short answer is that some of them just don't have the sense God gave a goat. And they confuse having a high IQ with being sensible. Like, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's, but in any case, the longer answer would be something like, I think there's just a, just a not an understanding of the historical reality of tech. And by the way, to Richard's point, which I thought was quite well put about trust, it is completely self-destructive. We get a way in, those of us who are entrepreneurs for looking weird and living our own lives and not being particularly conformist because people in America see that we're creating value for them. And if the Silicon Valley of the, of the first generation was building things that Americans understood would help them. If you're sitting on your perks in Silicon Valley and you're only creating value for yourself, monetizing the natural resources of other of your fellow Americans and others in the form of monetizing their data and providing no value to them, except for disrupting the businesses that people work at, you're going to find that your level of trust it goes really down really far quickly. And I don't think this is something you can kind of IQ your way out of, which is I think essentially one of the problems in Silicon Valley. They just think that they're so smart that they can smart their way out of this. But it's just so obvious. And so I think, and then there's a historical reality. I think a lot of people in Silicon Valley are the worst offenders. Well, they shift. I mean, I don't, it's like, I don't know if it's helpful. It comes in a rolling and a rolling set of offenses. And by the way, I'm hopeful that at some point could be some reform because now this is something that really most people are very, very aware of. And by the way, it's a reason why a lot of us, you know, I guess I mentioned, I believe we're the first company to leave the valley. When we left the valley, it was looked at as something completely crazily ridiculous. Who could leave the valley? Now, lots of people are leaving the valley. And part of the reason they're leaving the valley is because the brand of the valley is not good. And it's not good because they can't answer simple questions. What is your software do to help somebody? And the answer will be, I give a lot of money to philanthropy. Well, I'm all in favor of philanthropy, but there has to be a more direct answer. What does your business do? Or maybe there should be a more direct answer. Our country, our company does nothing to help humanity. And we're okay with that. But there's like, so in any case, I think, I think there's a rolling set of offenders. I think the rolling set of offenders will probably change over time, not for the right reasons, but simply because it just can't go on like this. To what extent do you blame them personally? Because, for example, their motivation is just profit maximization without any other consideration versus accept that they have a duty to their shareholders. And also, if regulation doesn't exist, they have every right to continue operating in the way that they are. I don't dispute anyone's right to work within the context of a law. And part, I mean, and I very much believe these things should be regulated so that people can have, you know, work within the context of a law. And it is true that it's so, but if you are on the cutting edge, just to take the very simple example of that are myopic perks, helping the Western world stay as strong and become stronger in the future. And so that the West structurally wins the battles of both the software battles, but also the narrative battle of what it means to organize a society where there's wealth provision, education, civil liberties are protected, and we can have open discourse. If, in fact, you are profit maximizing in your country, and that country is protecting you, you have a duty to protect the country. So, you know, you can, you can, I mean, I love academic debates of this sort, and I'd be more than happy to go down the rabbit hole of, you know, at what point do you, dude, is it a combate on someone to diverge from their actual economic interest and do good? And that's a really, really important debate. But in the context of we are the global winners of X, and we are partly the global winners because we are in a country. The answer cannot be we do not support that country. And that, so that would be my first baseline. And then after that, we can have a more area to, area to debate. I do think, yeah. Well, I know, I was going to say, I'll try one last time to ask you, and again, I understand if you don't want to say it, but which company you'll see, though, is the big offender today on that front? Well, you know, I'm not trying to evade the answer and invading the answer. I just think, you know, it's like, it really is a thing like, on Tuesday, it's X on Wednesday, it's why I think the, I think Silicon Valley as a culture is the great offender. I actually don't think it's an individual thing. And I'm not just trying to like evade your answer, because that's my job. Apparently, my lawyers tell me my job is to evade the answers of journalists and never answer a question. And by the way, they're going to get me into these workshops. So I learned that like, evade answers better and never say anything. However, that's so far I've evaded them. But, but, but I think it's a, I really think it's a cultural problem. They're sitting in their person Silicon Valley, where they're the smartest the best in the richest. They don't understand how they're viewed in society or how that's viewing our society. And, and then when asked, can they help America? They, they tend to think this is a super difficult question that should be litigated with the one or two or five engineers in their company that don't agree with helping the US government. And I think it's a cultural problem. And that's why so many of us have left this culture. And, and there's another sort of slightly different angle on what could be the consequence of this. Do you think we're at a tipping point? Perhaps we pass the tipping point when consumers start to turn on these services as well, because they decide that the cost of giving up their data, their cost of giving up some of their privacy, it is more expensive than the services they've been getting for free, as it were in recent years. The consumers should probably, but probably not quick enough. It's just because it's again, the salt that the technical abilities of Silicon Valley are unparalleled. And it just makes it super, super easy. Like the products are built for ease, it's easy to do it. It's, it appears to be free. I, I think that governments have to be involved. I think governments have to be involved for two reasons. One, because clearly Silicon Valley doesn't seem to believe self-regulation is a concept that means much. And B, I think the, the cost to the corrosion of our discourse and also the wealth disparity is so high that it could, it will, over time, will lead to just totally dystopian discussions. And feeds into the hands of people that may in fact have less on the remedy side, but more on the popular side, which I don't think isn't anyone's interest. So I think, I think that that's where this is going to have to go. I think it's interesting. This is also generally the view outside of America. It's becoming the view inside of America. And I, I think that there will, I, I believe there will be change, but not quick enough. In terms of the, it's good time, I think, to come to the words mentioned in the title of this discussion about whether tech is a sword or a shield. But overall, despite the last 10, 15 minutes of discussion, I presume your conclusion is today that it is much more force for good than it is for bad. Is that fair? I think I agree with that, but I, I think, strong tech is always a sharp instrument. So if you take our product, you know, we have, we, we power most of the clandestine services in Europe, the most data protection, rich environment. You can't even sell your product in some countries in Europe until you prove the civil areas protections will work. And which in kind of more just plain terms means we can show exactly how the software is working, who actually touched the, the, the actual targeting package, how they touched it, what the data sources were in the European context, what was perched, what was not perched. However, any tech that actually does something effective can be abused, which is why there is always a need for like government sovereignty, government, governments being involved, consumer, avid, customer, citizen advocacy to understand. By the way, it's another reason why tech has to be built so it can be made transparent. In our case, it's so easy to like sell something. In many cases, these things don't actually work, but at black boxes, like there has to be a way to take the box apart and see what's happening in the engine as a way of creating transparency. And to the introductory point, you know, there's a crisis of legitimacy around, around these things. And there's a legitimate side of that crisis of legitimacy, which is these very sharp tools can be abused, will be abused if they're not looked at carefully. And then there's got to be a way that normal people can look at the tech and evaluate, is this being used under what conditions is it being used? And is it being used in a way that is either not legal or not ethical or something, or do we need to change the law because our norms have changed around how the use of the tech should happen? But I do think every technical advance is something that could be abused. And in aggregate, the advances are, you know, way much outweigh the dangers, but obviously there are dangers. I want to get on to military uses, and then also what you do for individual pilots in a moment, but just around that part of, are you optimistic regulators and lawmakers on top of this that will see the right regulation in the next year or two or not? I don't know, actually, the true answers I don't know. It depends on how much of a push people make on our leaders. There has to be a technical discourse about what is actually changed. And so I would put it like 50-50. Switching focus or a bit more on specifically the military classes that we might have in the next decade or so, hopefully we won't. How important is it that the US maintains its innovation lead on the tech side? So is either to be able to use it in a conflict if necessary or rather to avoid the need for a conflict? Will the next conflict be sparked? There's a lot of points here, and this would be where there's a legitimate intellectual disagreement between me and most people, I would say in Silicon Valley. But the interesting thing about software is it's just non-linear to the extreme. So we tend to want to believe things were working on or things we tech products we interact with are similar and largely comes down to taste. What do I prefer in X-Tech product versus Y? But de facto I could switch and there's usually a cost difference and that may be more the case in hardware. It's not the case in software. So this is again back to why do I think America will continue to produce world-class disruptive software companies? It's because there's a culture to do this, the culture is disruptive, and the output is totally non-linear. So one country can spend $100 billion and a small group of startups in Chicago can get financing worth $100 million and they just massively outperform the country that spent $100 billion. And so to your question, I believe the West and American particular needs the best software-enhanced systems or software systems precisely so that we don't have conflicts. Because if in fact our adversaries have the best software systems, software-empowered systems or in the end, pure software which you could call advanced AI, there's AI is often thrown around as a jargon term. But in this context, military technology powered by somewhat or completely autonomous systems or human powered systems that also have autonomous capabilities. Those capabilities are not going to be even. It's not going to be one is here and one is here. It's one is in the, you know, at the moon and one is on the at a skyscraper range. And the country, and this is where I just flat out have a disagreement with most people, I would say in the valley, but often others, and it's a legitimate disagreement, I guess. I believe if one country has a nuclear bomb and the other country has a set of dull knives, the country with the nuclear bomb is going to define how the world works. And they are going to have very little interest in what, you know, maybe, and many my academic friends disagree with me. I believe in universal norms. I want universal norms. I believe in, like, Kantian ethics and the American Constitution, but if we, if our adversaries and nuclear bomb and we have a dull knife, I do not believe that these kind of norms will ipso facto sprout from the hearts of humans and the world order that we like to live in will actually exist in the way we like to live in it. And I think the mistake in the framing is to either on the one hand assume that the delivery of arms is going to be in any way similar. So that's linear. So it's a 10-20 percent difference and you can make up with it by spending extra capital, which is just just not the case in software. Or they believe the norms of our adversaries will inherently migrate to our norms under some kind of interesting self-referential dialectic that happens automatically, which I largely don't understand as an argument. Now that you can have that argument, I don't understand it and don't subscribe to it. And at a paladie or we believe that to have the kind of norms that we want to live in in the world, there has to be parity, at least parity, if not superiority, in the context of delivering software to American its allies. Is there a country that's close to being ahead of the US or has a chance of being ahead on the front China perhaps Russia? China and Russia are both exceeding. One of the things I did this crazy PhD in Germany and one of the most important things I learned was that we were taught to take the argument that we are disagreeing with that make it into the very best argument humanely possible. So let's switch out everything and then defeat the argument. And so I think we should just because we have so many disagreements with China and Russia and so many fronts, we should not ever underestimate how sophisticated these cultures and countries are at highly technological things, including software but other things that that sometimes involve weapon systems but just involve other things that just involve technology. These are highly developed, highly capable, worthy in the sense of they can produce things we can produce or better if we're not careful adversaries. And in both cases, I would be certainly we would be remiss not to put our best foot forward. I would say in this context, one of the things that we believe I believe is, you know, in Palantir in my years of building a company and running it is you really have to focus on your own business. So it's like the most helpful way to beat our rivals is to put our best foot forward, not to run around talking about how great they are. Obviously, we have to be aware of how strong they are, but America is more than capable, especially in the software context of having a winning. But it is very much the case of putting our best foot forward. And to your point, if we do not put our best foot forward, yeah, we won't win. Have you engaged with both the Trump administration and now the Biden administration on this? Has there been a change in response? You encourage by the response? Well, you know, it's funny. We've worked with like our software has been deployed under four presidents. The level at which these things happen is like us engaging with say someone running a part of the DOD or a part of a clandestine service. These are highly capable professionals. Honestly, I wish more people had access to them because, you know, it is crisis of legitimacy that we have across the West and in America as well is in part because the people that are doing some of the most interesting coolest things and most important things that are highly competent and knowledgeable never show up in the public. But we were we're very engaged along a whole series of these issues, many of which were obviously not really allowed to say much about under the last four presidents and very helpful that we will be very engaged under under this president. I want to switch focus a little bit and talk about your work with various corporates. Of course, lots of business leaders listening today. How do you entice a company to do business with you? What's your pitch to them? Well, you know, the thing is we have a number of the more important clients, companies in the world using our products. So like in just as an example, 3M, Chrysler, Fiat, Rio Tinto, BP is a very, very long list and a lot of our growth both in commercial and in government is concentric circles of people saying, hey, why is it that ABC doesn't work? And in the beginning, in the Intel's play services and DOD and in commercials, like, well, why don't you call that Motley company we've heard of with the crazy looking CEO with the 12 year olds? Because we've heard that the software works. And enterprise software is kind of a thing that where people often struggle to understand what its utility is. We went from use case to use case, basically. Now, we have a technical thing on both commercial and government where we believe we're supplying software the way it'll be supplied in five years. So in the government context, we said we would supply instead of one off systems bespoke built with literally a million hours of human labor and at with the cost of a billion dollars will install our software in weeks at a cost often. We should say we should go to clients in the in the government space and say it'll be 1% of the time, 5% of the cost pay us when we've installed. Now in the government context, they often can't just pay you afterwards. But in the commercial context, we would say the same thing. In the beginning, we largely build our business around companies that were having a crisis and the CEO was very frustrated because they couldn't figure out why they couldn't rebuild or do A, B, C, D, why it was going to have to take eight months instead of what seemed to be something you could do. And they're very technical issues under those questions. In the commercial space, we have somewhat of a radical view. This is purely technical. This is not how we entice the clients, but our view is that in five years, a great number of people are going to buy software the same way they buy every other technical product. They're not going to, like when you're we're talking here, you didn't install the 15 things into the camera, put it together and decide that your Frankenstein monster would be a great way to do this interview. You bought a finished product. Palantir would make Palantir foundry so unique and the way we manage it Apollo is that you can buy the whole stack. It'll be installed in a couple days and you will not have to have a thousand products sewn together by a massive IT organization. However, we also believe in this is totally counterintuitive, but is it actually a trueism software that the individual parts of that stack can be sold as modules, each of which is superior to the modules that you could otherwise buy from other companies because the individual modularity is actually not in contradiction to building the whole stack. They actually reinforce each other. So what's unique technically is in both government and commercial is the way we actually deliver the software and the speed with which we can deliver it. And in the beginning in both cases, we didn't even bother with that because it was like, look, you have a crisis. We will solve it and after that, you can buy your software. And we did for years and years, we insisted in the commercial space of doing it for free. Why? Of doing the pilot for free? Why? Because people are legitimately skeptical of software. All these software companies seem to have the same jargon on their website. How would you ever tell the difference between one person's jargon and another's? You know, it's like, one of the most interesting things about software is if you're not a software engineer, it's very hard to evaluate the difference in jargon that makes no sense and there's like a largely a waste of your time and something that actually can help you. And so we we solved that by actually installing it. Now we have all these references when people now call us or want to know my real answer is like, look, it's very hard to evaluate software. If you're a software engineer, we can explain to you technically. But you could also just call these five clients, you know, pound year in all modesty. We have the very best client list in the world. And that's despite having me as the frontman. They're like, how does that happen? It's like, you know, there's like they they, it's like, so you have like this ray. So that's just, you know, the way the best way to evaluate software is say, okay, that sounds kind of interesting. Let me talk to someone who's used it. Let me do a pilot and do it on some problem. You actually care about not some air-saturac problem. And then see, well, does it work? What are the costs? And, you know, why is the thing I've invested in? And if there's only some part like we have this great partnership, great partnerships with IBM and AWS. Another thing to look at is again, who are their partners? I mean, you know, we have a list client list. I would say no other company in the world has a client list like ours on the client-destin-service company list. And then we have these partners IBM, AWS. I think those are two of the most notable, most interesting software companies that human history has produced. I know I agree. And I have a follow-up on that particular point if we get have time. But my quick follow-up on that broad topic is all of the company names you've just listed are big, big companies. Is there a risk for smaller companies out there? Even if you offer free service for a trial that they get left behind over the next decade because they're scared to deploy capital on new expensive tech. And they should have done perhaps but upfront and they haven't done. You know, medium-sized companies are going to be very, very good for pounds. So I'm highly biased here. But it's because, you know, most medium-sized companies have just enough soft money to pay for software that can be transformative for them today and no money for waste. And we love those companies. And they're going to be very happy with us, I believe. And so we look at them as a massive opportunity. And again, it's an often these smaller companies are, you know, it's like, you know, it's you really the smaller company that easiest to know exactly what's being spent and how. And so, you know, it's true. We have brand name, I would say, among the best brand names in the world using Pound here and those contracts are very, very large because, you know, like I think it's probably good for one of our clients that they're making a billion dollars a year off of using our product. And of course, they pay us sums of money a small company can never pay us. But of course, it's just it's a relatively mass portion of what they're making. However, I would tell you the other thing that I think the smaller companies just have to be very, very adaptive and hungry. You know, it's a and then software again, it's an unfair sport. You can be smaller. If you execute on software, you will do very well against people have resources there are 10 times your size. Look at our little tiny company. We started not very long ago with five people. We power, we are by far the most important company in supplying software to governments in the West. And they're really no second. And so like, how does that happen? So you can go from small to big very quickly. I think this is also something American companies are really, really good at being adaptive, changing, throwing out ideologies that don't work, working with people that you may never have worked with before. This is a this is a cultural attribute of the USA. And I think one that we Pound here are going to benefit and our band a fitting from enormously already. You teed up the IBM AWS partnership there. Some would have thought you guys would be rivals. So what exactly did them? Well, I mean, first of all, the IBM AWS need no introduction and they don't need me or Pound here to extoll their virtues. IBM is one of the, you know, is the oldest, most storied and maybe has a large, global footprint of any software company in the world. Is it just absolutely dominant in certain jurisdictions? A DAPUS is this product juggernaut run by very, very technical people. It's it's a very interesting and building partnerships that, you know, the classically Shay is you would, you know, it's it's just very it was very easy for us to work with them because we're 75% of us are engineers. The last they're 20% of Pound here are highly quality quantitative. And so these are these are great product companies. You you could say that we should be adversaries. But what I've known what we've learned in our work both in the clandestine military service and commercial is companies at their level of talent and technical acuity know how hard it is to build what we've built. And so it's very it's a very quick to sky. It's much quicker, easier discussion with companies like this and how you partner because we know what we have. We're not entering their space and perhaps they could enter our space, but they know how hard it is because building what we've built, especially the parts of the stack they want. Like an IBM's case, it's a module, they want some of our modularity a part of our stack, but not all very hard to do. And then in eight W's case, we're partnering on a number of use cases. They also know how hard it is to do. And then we respect their cultures. We work very well with them. And so if you if you meet cultures that you work well with because of deep engineering prowess and similar kind of ideas of what would work and not, then the idea then then it's very easy to sort out what here we should work together here. We shouldn't because you have a pretty clear and deep understanding of the enormous problems that IBM has solved, that Eddie of us has solved. We have no interest in trying to solve those problems. And I think they have a fair deal of respect for what we've done in a very short period of time. And so like when we make these claims that quite frankly some on Wall Street have thought have been mad, like, you know, we're providing software that in its totality, you can buy it once or its modularity is the best on the market. And that's how and by the way, people will buy software in a different way. That seems mad maybe to someone looking at this from the outside. It doesn't seem mad to the two best among the two best software companies in the world because they know how difficult it would be to do that. And they can evaluate that what we're saying is absolutely true and they can do that very quickly. Very very very clear and strong answer that. I want to ask really about COVID. We talked about the risk on data privacy earlier. And obviously there's a lot of talk at the moment about things like vaccine passports. When you consider the area of personal health data, the risks outweigh the potential rewards or the other way around when you consider the advances, the medical advances that might come out of this with the power of your data analytics and getting more of that personal health data. Well, you know, the conversation began with the failure of legitimacy in Western countries. And I think in the end, what software has to do is simultaneously increase human health and wealth and increase legitimacy. And so the big problem on all these things is people want to understand, sure, I think most the vast vast majority of people are in favor of using software to increase health outcomes. This will also in the pandemic and this will not be the last pandemic and this will not be the last time we have to develop and distributive vaccine. Those are very much things that require software. But people want to know how is it built? How is distributed? What is it? What is the actual thing we're reacting to? What is the cost? What is the science? What is the data show? And they want to be able to look into the product and see if in fact the things we're doing reflect our general views. And the general views are also very different. How Germans, French, Japanese people and Americans view data or British people as a great example. The British view of data privacy and the American view of data privacy are very, very, very different both are vibrant democracies. So these things also have a certain cultural specific specific specific nature that cannot be ignored. And this is that to use a fancy ex academic term is that dialectic between output transparency and legitimacy. And we really have not done enough on the on the interplay between output and legitimacy. And then you get these huge problems. But by the way, we're going to have obviously have to solve these problems because this will not be the last pandemic. This will be not the last time we have to distribute a vaccine. It will not be the last time we have all these discussions about who goes where under what conditions. And we're not out of it yet. And two more questions, both the audience questions that have been sent through us. We've been going. The first is what is the single best and the single worst decisions made as a CEO over the last decade? Well, the single best decision I made was hiring personally being involved in the hiring of the first 350 people. And that and then building a culture with them. And it's those people in that culture that has powered our everything good about parentheer. That I've made so many bad decisions. I mean, I wouldn't even know where to start there. But I mean, I honestly think my life was like besides starting parentheer and probably getting a PhD in Germany, it was like kind of a lot of bad decisions. But and then in the context of parentheer, we make bad decisions all the time we correct, our first commercial product was an unmitigated disaster. We didn't correct it quickly enough. We've sometimes made hiring mistakes. You make a lot of mistakes in business. But in any case, I know the best decision I ever made was hiring the first 350 people personally, instilling, helping to instill the culture that became palantir and being a shepherd of that culture. The final question kind of brings us back to probably the key topic of the first half of the discussion on national security threats. Do you think national security threats against America are currently underestimated? And what is the biggest one? Well, you already touched on this. I think just the the necessity of America to be in the lead and software enhanced systems and what is broadly called AI is something people understand, but they don't understand it enough. And that will in the end, if it's one side as a nuclear power and the other side as a dull life power or a machine gun power, the side that again, just to repeat what I said before, that that that has the essential equivalent of software nuclear arms will define the world order. And I don't think we in America or in the West will be particularly happy if that's not us. Well, right on time, in fact, we're a minute earlier, 10, 10, 54 Alex, it's really been a pleasure to have a full a full hour, just shy of an hour with you today and to go through all of the topics that we've just had and our thanks also to Margaret and Richard for inviting us. But Alex, I'm sure everyone else remotely will want to put their hands together to thank you for this this great discussion. Thank you very much. No, thank you. Thank you for the questions and thank you to your audience.
