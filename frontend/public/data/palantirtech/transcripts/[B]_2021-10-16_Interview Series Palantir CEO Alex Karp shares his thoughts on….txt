TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We've gone from a company, we crossed the billion dollar gap revenue market. There is no reason this company should not be 20 times bigger. We both overestimate and underestimate ourselves in private. But the version of Palantir IC is that when we were in Palantir in 2008, we had a half a product held together by people who were willing to live in a skiff. And that product now powers most of the Intel services in Europe and stops terror attacks that otherwise would have turned Europe into a different kind of Europe where walking and that would be very, very far outside the norm on the right side. So we fundamentally changed the history of America and Europe by stopping terror attacks. We had a failed product which we overcame. We built many products that are aware of guy and others that other people don't know exist, but actually power a lot of the efforts you see in the news. We launched Foundry which is definitely inarguably the most successful product in the world in what we do. By the way, any other company would be 400 products with 1000 salespeople on each one. We regalvanized our American image, which I think was suffering under being private for too long. We became not only neutral in America, but exceedingly charismatic. We're the only company that we're the DPO with people of its own leadership. People at Palantir, especially new people or people who are younger, which is many people at Palantir, assume that in a normal company, the people run the company, own the company and are interested in the company working long term. This is mostly not the case. We were able to get into the public markets without selling our souls to the vicious, vacuous, and otherwise idiotic forces of banking because we're not in the business of sales. We're figuring that out. I'm sure we'll talk about more. We are doing great efforts to figure that out in Europe and in America. Within the context of our Higallian culture, meaning that we're not going to have the contradiction of real product development, real imputation, and sales, not just one or the other. The thing that I'm most proud of and keep me most motivated is Palantir's culture, of course shifts and changes, but this company is not actually run by anyone individual. It's run by our culture, which still attracts among the best people and keeps among the best people. Honestly, for many of us, because we're smart enough and wise enough to know the alternatives suck, so it's not maybe that we're as good as we want to be, but the alternatives luckily really suck. Many of the alternative people, enough people have left Palantir so that one of the frustrations of building the company is people who'd gone to Stanford, my alma mater, and obviously somewhat overrated school for those of us who went to Stanford. But it only been it's heaven, Stanford, and heaven Palantir, and then left for what they thought were greener grasses, often sometimes, but found out that they were not quite as green. But in any case, this culture that we have is something we have to fight for. I believe the way we took the company public and DPO was very protective of that, but obviously there are lots of things to figure out and do better. In a normal company, people have normal roles, and that's part of the reason why it's very, it is hard for people who join here, who've had lots of other experience to join here. We don't, the higher you go at Palantir and the lower you go at Palantir, I hope, the less defined your role is. My role, the way I can see it, is to help insert qualitative variables that will be relevant, are relevant now, or are we relevant in the future before they can be codified in an algorithm across the company. So a business does not win where you are just working on things you understand. You have to work on a lot of things that are not understandable, but very simply like, why was PG better than Metropolis? Because we made a bet that the world would move towards a world where data protection and civil liberties were important. But why did our DPO work? Because we made a bet that this was the right timing. Why did, and there's lots of micro decisions across the company. Why do we use this kind of advertising and not that kind of advertising? Why does this kind of person need to get more space to work or another person needs to be moved around? Why is it that we bet, we go long in this jurisdiction and short in another district, how do we overcome the resistance of, you know, sometimes well-meaning actors institutions and sometimes quite frankly the malicious forces of laziness as embodied by the IT departments? How do we get the structure to reflect its culture? And these things end up being a rolling, cascading chaotic thing that invariably I work on basically all day. So like, you know, I think when people work with me, they expect, I don't know why, like some kind of like very normal meeting structure where we're going to sit down and go, it's one point to the next to the next to the next. I'm not denying that can work and many of you work in that structured way and it's clearly productive. But that's not actually how you get what I can help the company with into the company and not so much at Palantir. But definitely when I see too much of that at other companies, I really wonder what are they hiding with these long meetings as opposed to getting to the unvarnished truth. That's what you have to do to get to be disruptive. And you know, we should never forget we are the maximally, we are maximalist outsiders. Nobody is ever going to buy our product. No one's going to buy our shares. No one's going to actually show up and stick up for us unless we are unique, differentiated and the best. And to get that best to work, you've got to get things that don't fit to fit together like sales and engineering, like two engineers that have very different views, like even just building a product. You're going to need someone who can conceive of the product, you're going to need someone who can conceive the front end of the product, you need someone to play the bike and then you need someone who can actually make the product ship. They all just like each other. As you know from building these things or not to the point of dislike, hate, but it's like they're just, it's very hard to see the more technical the people are, the more they're, but that's the reason why we're standing here. That's the reason we get away with being unique because we've actually done this. And every normal company does this a half a time and acquires 20 companies. We did, we've done it at least five times and like the iceberg of our product development is not even exposed to what they don't even believe we're going to do it. Normal software companies produce once. So normal investors look at parent here and they see something, okay, that, you know, well no one can do this five times. And they're going to be, they're going to wake up to a world that we play a very, very big role in. If you're going to buy like some weak product that barely works that you install, you can't then say, but what happens when the product is 50 times more complex than it is now. And the complexity that we are, we are up against in the world is a complexity that parent here embraces. This is why we, we attack and structures. This is why we go after the most talented people. This is why we built the culture to make sure we keep those people because we're presupposing a radical increase. And complexity and everyone else is presupposing a Disney fairy tale that I don't think anyone ever, even believes anymore. But since there's, it's too dangerous to think of the world the way it is. People run and hide and service their institutions in ways that will not work. And the COVID institute, the COVID pandemic is just the first of many like waves we're going to see. And Palantir was built for this and it's, it would be an exaggeration to say the world rests on our shoulders. And it's by the way, but it is scary to think how much of the world rests on our shoulders. You know, the mission was why we started the company and it's, it is really crucial. But I would say the, like watching Palantirians suffer through a deployment for me the most compelling is the work we've done. Example, this is a work we've done in COVID, especially in US and Britain, just like it's so motivating. And it makes me want to also do a lot of shit. I honestly don't want to do that. I wouldn't do otherwise. I'm personally surprised, but it's like then I think of some Palantirian and all the crap that you're going through. It's certainly more painful than when I'm going through. And then I think, yeah, well if they can do that, I definitely have to show up and do this meeting that I don't want to do or fly somewhere. But it's very, very compelling and I, I know I'm very, very grateful. You
