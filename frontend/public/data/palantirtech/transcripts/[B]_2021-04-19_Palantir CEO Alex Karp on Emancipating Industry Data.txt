TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Welcome to my barn. We took our company public here. The documents that some of you have read were all written here. And a lot of our best decisions in the history of Poundture were made in this barn. Most importantly was to take COVID seriously and close our offices. I think we're the first to do it. And then to offer our product both inside America and outside of America globally, for free to combat COVID and all its permutations, including supplying PPE, rebuilding supply chains, figuring out who and under what conditions people were becoming. In fact, doing this in correspondence with local jurisdictions, their data protection laws, which are often complicated but very important and very important to the citizens of each country, but are not template. One of the most important things we learned about helping countries was that the product we had really built for commercial usage was exceedingly helpful in emancipating, freeing, unencumbering the data that was locked in silos and was very hard for governments to get access to in real time and be difficult to understand their total resources, their resource allocation, and rebuilt supply chains in a timely manner. We're very grateful we had the honor to and I still have the honor of working with countries and supplying a foundry to them and exceedingly proud of the fact that the countries we've helped are doing disproportionately significantly better in the countries that the world, especially most notably the USA and England that are distributing the vaccine effectively are heavy users of the Palantir product. In this next phase, one of what we'd like to do is figure out ways we can help accelerate rebuilding supply chains, reopening, re-envisioning industries that are now coming back online, especially in the United States of America where vaccine distribution is among the best in the world. And what we learned, the most important thing we learned and have seen around the world is that countries and institutions that have the ability to re-envision themselves have it because they have unfettered access to their data, that many countries and institutions are bound and indeed one can say chained to the mast of formatting, ontologies, and complicated relationships with companies that don't allow them unfettered access to their own greatest resource, their own data. And given the crucial nature of making sure industry comes back online in a way that's even more nimble than before COVID, because especially now the conditions are often completely transformed, we're going to go to the industries in America especially, but also globally that are employing the most number of people and offer to emancipate, unshained, unfettered, and give them their data back for free to allow these industries to make decisions that are in the best interest of their clients, their employees, and their countries. Of course, we really hope that they will see the, the powentures also in our view, the very best option for managing the data after we emancipate the data, but this is much more about really kickstarting and accelerating transformation that will have to occur in a crucial time where the quality of life of the employees of large industry may come down to the ability of an industry to re-invision itself, and it being hampered in doing this by very complicated contractual and ontological relationships with with their own data. Something that we obviously have pushed back against in the consumer internet space where you have a very similar thing where we somehow don't own our own data, this should not happen to enterprises, and it's crucial in this phase where countries depend upon industry really coming online for our health and wealth, and so this is what we're going to work on in the next couple months until the end of the year, that combined with the fact that our work in especially commercial and government in the US of A is just dramatically increasing, should keep us appellant here very close to what we like to do most, which is work on our company and work on helping institutions that help the countries we work in. Thank you.
