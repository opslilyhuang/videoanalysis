TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm Chad Walk, I'm an architect at Palantir. Today I have a conversation with Honorude. He leads our commercial and retail business at Palantir. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for having me. Yeah, so maybe you could tell us a little bit about your background. You have a very interesting background at Palantir. So I joined Palantir as a forward to forward engineer 70 years ago. I came out of college and the first thing that I was kind of tasked to do was I was sent to this region in the UK called the North Sea, which is sort of like big oil field for BP and two weeks of onboarding and then you know part of a one-person team. You know tasked with kind of solving this like maintenance problem that they had. So as you can imagine like not the easiest thing for a new grad but that's been sort of like the that was the precursor of like every other experience that I had at Palantir. And I think what that taught me and like everything else that I did after that was like how do you become an entrepreneur? You know how do you kind of solve these things? First of all figure out what is worth solving, what are the hardest things that you can actually like tackle that you have the capability to how do you kind of seek help or like seek places where you can go. And it's kind of like just build leverage and then finally like deliver like deliver the value and then kind of do that over and over again. So that's been my journey and that's led me to this place of you know now we're kind of building our retail business. Yeah I mean that's a story here all the time of that entrepreneurial spirit of like true ownership over the outcome rather than I'm just doing this thing and I think that's really where you know everyone talks about all the kind of the Palantir mafia of people that have come out and started other companies. I think there's a reason for it is that that culture of extreme ownership and entrepreneurial like I have to figure this out it's going to be painful but I'm going to get through it like that spirit is really kind of at the base of some of it. Yeah and I see this over and over again right like even you know now I'm doing this like people that are you know owning bigger portfolios than me they're doing it. Interns on my team are doing it is like everyone is kind of going through that process of like let's figure out what the most valuable problem to solve is in the context of like the things that I'm owning and then what is the thing that we can learn from that that we can productize and like solve across the entire kind of surface area of Palantir. Yeah and so you have a unique ecosystem of help and support and product while still growing this business at a pretty extreme rate like that's probably not found many other places. So we talked to a lot of customers sometimes together we hear all the time like it's really confusing like what do you really do are you software coming to consult and what do you do like what's your answer. Yeah so it's like it's not that we do everything even though that's kind of like the outcome of it. The reality of what we do is we accentuate the thing that makes a retail company unique and competitive in their industry right and that process of finding the thing that's kind of like their competitive advantage is what we spend the first sort of few months of the engagement on this could be through a boot camp or through a pilot where we say we're coming in to solve the hardest problem. What that really means is we're going into discover kind of the biggest rock that is preventing this particular company from kind of achieving the you know the next step of growth that they want to achieve and then from there it does two things one is it gives us a view of their data lane landscape their model landscape their process landscape and we encode all of that into an initial ontology and number two it gives us a view into the adjacent problem spaces that are either impacted by that bigger that big rock that we've just heard or that are causing that big rock to happen and then it kind of expands from that right so the balance your program by the end of you know year one or year two looks like an enterprise transformation program right which is why a lot of people say balance it just does everything yeah in reality it starts off with like let's find the hardest problem let's find the thing that makes either makes you unique and valuable in the market or is preventing you from getting there yeah so how do you get over that from the standpoint of like how are people transitioning like what type of person needs do you need to engage with like get that change I think so the the best sort of like partners that I have had in retail are the people who are builders you know they're willing to kind of roll up their sleeves they're willing to take a critical eye on what has not worked you know if you're building three data warehouses that are exactly the same but in different platforms like clearly something's broken so someone who's willing to kind of like take the you know red pill let's call it so I know you work a lot across a lot of different retailers a lot of different countries see a lot of different stuff what are some of themes you see across all of them so yes we worked with some of the biggest retailers they're very successful in their industry in the markets they operate in and they've been growing right they they're growing through acquisitions through just you know your share will they have amazing leadership but the way they're supporting the growth is just by adding more people to their core functions what they really need is a way to underpin this growth with technology that goes beyond just reporting beyond just you know the sort of like support role yeah so to speak like more conceptually like what's happening is kind of as they're growing they're buying more and they're selling more right and that's sort of like the the retail funnel there's a lot that happens between that and as you're growing the funnel you're kind of growing the width of it you are putting more stress in your very human driven operations yeah you are creating sort of bigger gaps when crisis happened when like disruptions happen in that in those like fragile systems and these things become very visible you know when COVID happened like we saw the cost of goods crisis yeah last year when port strikes almost happened or when the hurricane season came by you know these things actually changed the way that they retail like a retail business runs and it exposes these gaps yeah very clearly and in those moments of clarity when like the leadership's like okay we need something between our like data warehouse system and our operations that's when like we get the call so I hear a lot of these different kind of like consumer facing things but when we talk about like store operations people are the lifeblood of these different organizations like how are we helping on the operational side of like the the people and workforce management so that is you know what be all a hard problem yeah you know when you're when you're a store manager and you're stuffing people day-to-day you need to optimize for associate satisfaction so make sure your people are happy customers satisfaction make sure people coming into the store have a good experience and just you know efficiency of the workforce itself you don't want to over-raster etc and typically the problem has been like pick one you know that's what most managers is like you you know pick one out of the three we solve all three and you know the sort of like behind the scenes what that looks like is a series of optimization models that look after your demand at a store level again very very kind of a store department every 15 minutes kind of thing they look at the preferences of your associates so what are their desires shifts you know which days can they work what kind of departments do they prefer working in what is there like personal approach goal etc and then of course what are the sort of customer like what is the voice of the customer say you know when are they coming into the store is their feedback from the customers directly that we can use to incorporate into a raw string programs etc and we crunch all of that data in the platform and then surface very simple actionable insights to the store manager to say look these are the recurring opportunities that the system is identified in your store you know click these buttons and it's kind of like automatically gets all the straighter down behind the scenes again it's the systems integration problem yes as you can imagine I think that's the the part that's pretty interesting here is like that automation of my business but it's not an isolation it's not like automate and get rid of people it's about how do I help people get more things done I think that's the thing that was always intriguing to me like the customer service engine example I mean like what are people's reactions when they see that like aha like AI is actually not this chatbot it's this workflow that helps me get more done yeah you're absolutely right the granularity and the automation interplay with each other with customer service you know this is the granularity that customer service AI can deliver is something like a per customer concierge or like a little microcosm of your entire business that you can hand to a customer that they get interact with yeah and it knows the customer because it has access to the customers buying history and you know all the interactions that they've had with the business it knows the business because it has access to the supply chain and it knows kind of you know where purchase orders are in their journey yeah it also has access to the process assets the state machines the right back capabilities the ERP systems that actually execute the business and because it has access to all of these assets it can actually run business on the customers behalf yeah so it's not just having a conversation with the customer that's like a day one problem of how do you build a chatbot the real problem is the day two problem with okay how do I actually run the business yeah through AI you know without sort of a human intervention or using as much automation as possible yeah so retail consumer you get an interesting flavor of kind of that front line and I heard you a couple times already say operational maybe you give a flavor of the kind of things we're helping these different customers when we say operational how is that different than you know reporting and analytics like what do you mean by operational in that space yeah so this is I think retail is an industry where it's like quite intuitive to people because they deal with retail businesses have they end in the out so like it's quite you know like I relate with it this early every time I go to a retail store yeah you can see the operational decisions that that that's so the sales are making yeah so these are things like you know in the store operations context store manager is raw string 10 to 100 people sometimes even hundreds on a daily basis yeah how do they decide who to put on in which shift how many people to put on on a week day versus a weekend or like you know during peak hours that is an operational decision but is something that can be enhanced with data and the right sort of like intelligence behind the scenes many many folds as compared to kind of just a human doing it intuitively that isn't the store ops and then you know in sort of the overall retail value chain from procurement merchandising supply chain you know marketing customer operations there's operational decisions being made across that which we're helping our partners solve yeah it's interesting as you say that that value chain because a lot of they're not an isolation I think that's that's a lot of where we bring value to our customers is connecting that value chain because a decision over here has it impacts upstream and downstream to those decisions right and I think maybe like I'd love to hear your perspective on that that value chain and how we're like really creating that connected workflow that enables that because I think from my perspective that's a differentiator but in the retail space I'm like maybe some examples like how we do that yeah so it you're absolutely right it's like a highly connected and interdependent value chain yeah and in a business like retail that's moving so fast every day you you're selling products you're buying new products it's moving through the supply chain decisions have a knock on effect or yeah it's called a butterfly effect yeah we're working with you know some of the biggest groceries globally and they're seeing massive impact of this so we have a customer in Australia that's rolled this out to over 800 stores over 10,000 you know active users that are actively using the platform to you know manage their day-to-day rosters and then even for like the sort of like central planning teams for example the workforce management team or a finance function having that visibility into how the frontline decisions are being made how the store managers are actually allocating their stuff and what can they actually not allocate right like that's a problem that the central teams can solve so things like you know I need to hire up-skill for a specific type of job profile because that's what's lacking in the significant proportion of my stores that is an insight that a workforce manager should know that's interesting so it's really the connected bag and forth because you want to help the the people at the edge making their optimisation for them that also is optimised globally but it's an interesting thing you're saying of like that also helps the centralised teams understanding it's signal from the edge of the things they can go solve for so it's really that bidirectional communication between these organisations. Yeah and that is so sort of differentiated because that signal that you're getting from this kind of federated decision model is helping you not only make better decisions at the central level based on the signal itself it's also helping you improve the models that then feed into the frontline decisions so for example you know before balanced here this customer was using purely just a demand-focus model to focus you know what kind of like the head count per week that I need to allocate at a global level and then how does that translate down to the stores but then hearing the voice of the store manager and why that focus might be wrong is actually is like a feedback loop that's going back into the forecasting so it's you know it's like a feedback loop that's very human-driven and like part of an operational loop inherently that's kind of being orchestrated by the ontology. Because it comes back to I think a key point is really around the differential here's the goal of the ontology is to make decisions versus a KPI or a metric because I think part of this when you talk about this like thousands of stores tens or hundreds of thousands of items tens hundreds or millions of people involved in these things like it's all about the nuance and the granularity and driving those decisions across there I think that's like a super key differentiator for us that's right well honey man thanks for coming to our guests I'll really enjoy the conversation as always same here thank you
