TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

A group of corporate America's top CEOs met with U.S. Senators this week to discuss support for Israel and the war against Hamas and a push for the release of hostages. Our Sarah Eisen sat down with the CEOs of Palantir and Pfizer to discuss the meeting and how they're advocating for corporate America to speak out against anti-Semitism. In America, leaders, especially people who are leading interesting businesses, have a unique role in shaping the way in which people think and what they do. And this is an issue where to speak up is going to require absorbing inbound. And that's how you know you're doing something important. More from Sarah's exclusive interview coming up next hour. Our Sarah Eisen spoke with a few of them, the CEOs of Pfizer, Albert Borla and Alex Carp of Palantir, as well as the mother of American and Israeli hostage Hirsch Goldberg. She asked why they were in DC and what they hoped to accomplish. Obviously, lots of things we're trying to accomplish, but in my humble opinion, the rise of anti-Semitism which is often linked with being virile anti-Israel and quite frankly being virile anti-West arises because we do not have public unity around values that most of us support. And I'll just, and I think the most poignant, obvious example is we have eight Americans being abused, probably including sexually abused in a dungeon. And we have to, I think most Americans want to know that America will act quickly when Americans are kidnapped, abused, murdered. And I think one of the reasons why you see people excusing this, celebrating this, often masked and terrorizing people, including people talking about the events on October 7th is because they're dancing on a party of our disunity when in fact most Americans believe that what happened on October 7th and especially what happened to Americans should trigger an automatic response that is punishing for people that dare to touch Americans in prison, torture and rape American citizens and getting a bipartisan group of politicians, senators, which in today's landscape is unusual. Getting business leaders to speak up was basically historic and so I'm proud to be part of this. And obviously, I don't have the same role as somebody whose son is in a dungeon now, but I'm doing my best, we're doing our best to show that there's a lot of unity especially among the corporate elite. Yeah, how, Rachel, did you get hooked up with the business leaders and what was your primary message today? Well, I actually had the privilege back in January of being invited to the party. The World Economic Forum in Davos through actually Alex and Palantir and there was an event that they had one night where they opened a forum for hostage families to talk to influential and powerful CEOs of companies all over the world and that is where I met Albert and many others. And so this came about sort of spring and forth from that initial meeting back in January and I, when I went today, I didn't know what to expect and it was such a pleasant surprise to see the unity of this bipartisan flavor in the room of people coming together. This is not a right or left issue. This is not a democratic or republican issue. This is a human issue. I was at that event in Davos for Rachel, you are a force and I know you have been delivering this message far and wide. But it's so interesting because corporate America has not led on this. So I am just wondering what has compelled you Albert to speak out to this interview? Go ahead, Alex. Sure, take it out. Look, I can't speak. I'm not representing corporate America, I'm representing myself. And I speak as a human being that cares deeply about what is going on over there. Since the day I met Rachel, I have nightmares thinking about her because the story came inside my heart in such a profound way. So I'm not going to stop speaking until all 120 are free. Alex, go ahead. You know, it's a fair and legitimate critique. I think for too long, the best version of this is corporate America assumed we could outsource moral discussions and leadership unless it was an easy question. Obviously it's an easy question and you can have a platitude where people clap and you can go back to business. People obviously love that. It's a free ride. But on issues that where leadership does mean you're going to have difficult, hard conversations with people and you may lose a couple of friends and you're going to get disinvited from the family wedding. But you know, in America, leaders, especially people who are leading interesting businesses, have a unique role in shaping the way in which people think and what they do. And this is an issue where to speak up is going to require absorbing inbound and that's how you know you're doing something important. Alex, what do you want to see the US government do? Well, luckily for the world, no one's putting me in charge of the US government. But where I am in charge, I would have a policy that any American that is in any way abused, especially including murder, assault and kidnapping, you would know that you and the people involved would pay a high price. And I would begin to persecute that across the globe. And I would use this as an example. And I would make it clear to adversaries. You can scream. You can abuse the United Nations. You can undermine the rule of law, which would also push back on these rulings in the SEC or completely ridiculous. But if you touch our citizens, including citizens I don't like, don't agree with, do not support me or pounce here, we will exact a price from you and we will free them. Rachel, what's your message to corporate America watching right now? Well, first of all, I think that it takes tremendous courage to stand up and do the right thing. And I think even people who are very powerful and influential, who are in corporate America, have to look themselves in the mirror at night before they go to bed. And they know the right thing to do. They know that ethical moral thing to do. And I know that it's complicated because people have interests and people have equities. And you have to worry about what you're going to say to your board members and what are going to be the gains. But at the end of the day, you have to be able to know that you are actually answering to your inner self. Are you being brave? Are you doing the right thing? Are you saying the right thing? And I would like to encourage you to have that strength to find that conviction, to do what will make you proud to be who you are. How big of a problem do you think anti-Semitism is in America right now, Albert? I think it's very big. I think it's rising. I don't say that it is what defines America right now. But I'm speaking to so many people, but they are of Jewish or non-Jewish origin. And they have never seen something like that in their lives before. How can you say about a poster, Kirol Hostedis, outside an event that speaks about a music festival? It's unbelievable the hate that you are living right now. So Alex, my question is, what can companies like yours do to fight this, both internally and externally? We've seen so many companies rally around social issues in the past few years. What about this one? I don't know how many companies are going to rally around the issue of fighting against anti-Jewish bias. But I am committed to speaking publicly to Kajol at people into doing it. I would say that Jews are a 0.2% of the world population and a much larger percentage of people doing interesting things. And so there's a lot of vulnerability. People, what I'd say Jewish Americans and Israel stands for as different, are different. But are you allowed to be exceptional? Are you going to be punished for being exceptional? Is our society going to allow institutions to be exceptional and the people in those institutions to grow based on their talents and their integrity? And I see it as being very important to get corporate leaders to speak out about the general issue. Because anti-Semitism is a negation of, do we believe that there will be accomplishment? Is accomplishment going to be fair? If somebody is disproportionately accomplished, do they become persecuted? And we need to get everybody who's doing things that are important, not just corporate America, building arts people involved in all sectors of life who are pro-accomplishment to speak out against this regressive movement. And I'm a little more optimistic than I was in the past because I can tell you, in private, nearly everyone doing anything is a gas at anti-Semitism. And once nothing to do with anti-Semites, the key issue is can you get people to go in public? And that's what we're working on. Last hour, we brought you part of the conversation with multiple CEOs talking about the Israel Hamas War and the rise in anti-Semitism. At follow the meeting with senators on both sides of the aisle this week, this is more from Sarah Eisen's conversation with the CEOs of Pfizer and Palantir, as well as the mother of American and Israeli hostage, Hersh Goldberg. My role is not to speak about politics. My role is to speak about people and issues. And the issue of the hostages is what I'm here to talk about. The fact, as Rachel says, that we worry about the hostages doesn't mean that we are not sad and hard-breaking about the thousands of people that were innocent and also were killed caught in this war. And the fact that, for example, I'm Jewish, very well known, doesn't mean that I speak only about hostages that happen to be... Not all of them, but part of them. Jewish. I was the first one to speak about Islamophobia, and I was very vocal to speak when George Floyd was assassinated. And I will... I stand with the Asians that were discriminated during COVID, and I am going to do always the right thing. But right now, there is a very simple issue. Islam is without a hand. It was imbutated during his captive, as he was captured. He is over there in a dungeon, 266 days. This mother deserves to see all of us doing more about demanding the release of those people. And, you know, Alex, you've made the point that American hostages, right, you have told me in interviews that this is a fight for our values, for the fight for the West. And Prime Minister Netanyahu said it in an interview with me a few weeks ago, our fight is your fight. Why do you think that message isn't resonating? If you look at Israel and Ukraine, Israel is very popular with the majority of people, and it's more complicated for the elite, and with the Ukraine words, the opposite. So, I actually think the average person in this country is much more likely to support Israel than to support Hamas. And then you have a politically factored country where, unfortunately, there's a left-right divide, and many people on the left see Prime Minister Netanyahu as an embodiment of a right-wing figure. So, there's a lot of projection, but I, my interactions in this country and abroad, by the way, in Europe, are kind of, it's a little bit the person on the street and the person in academia or in a lead institution have very, very different views on Israel. So, I slightly would dispute that. I look at war as bloody and disgusting and horrific, and there are innocent Palestinians who died, and that's a tragedy, and that's very, very hard to look at. And I don't, by the way, think defending Israel or fighting to bring home hostages, and again, in my case, especially the American hostages, but all hostages, is means that you're defending every policy of a country just like that my pride in America doesn't mean I'm defending every policy in America, and there are many policies I disagree with. So, there's a lot of issues there, but I would say most of America is horrified by what happened on October 7th, almost everyone in America is horrified by the dramatic rise of anti-Semitism, which is not, it does not receive the reaction it deserves, and most Americans would like to see leadership on the Middle East, on bringing hostages home, especially American hostages. And clear statements about discrimination, even discrimination against Jews. I feel though, I think part of the reason why leaders need to stand up is this is a very, very, very small minority of America. They succeed in having an outsized impact simply because the rest of America thinks they're so idiotic that this can't actually be dangerous or true, but it is dangerous, and they do believe these things. And if we do not speak up, they will continue to tell themselves this, and there will be a sense on their side that it's okay to push the boundaries and push the boundaries and push the boundaries. And so, as heinous as what these people are saying is, it exists in part because there are not enough people saying this is really dumb, this is hatred and it will not be tolerated. Again, not, eviscerating the First Amendment, but just using the First Amendment to say, hey, this is either stupid or hateful, it's very hard to know whether you're an idiot or you're a demigod or you're just purely a hateful person, but we disagree. Even if it is a minority, as Alex said, Albert, do you worry or do you experience backlash internally from your employees, customers, partners, when you speak out? I worry more about what is going on in America and try to explain it, and the semitism is on something that it is new. We saw it in the past as well, because for different reasons, zones are vulnerable because they are small minority, but the reasons of the semitism during the Nazis are different than the reasons of the semitism during today's world. And I think in today's the message is that people is not that they hate Israel, they hate America, they hate the American way of life, they hate the values that mainly discounted projects, which is a congress, it is a democracy, that women have the same rights, like men, that LGBTQ community can be free to express themselves. A lot of this everybody can choose the religion, that he wants or no religion at all, this is what America is all about. And this is exactly the opposite of what Hamas is about, and those people are mainly hating America, and that's why they hate Israel, and that's why they try because it's vulnerable to politicize that. Even internally in companies, there's talk of discrimination and bias, and I do wonder if DEI needs to evolve, Alex. I think you will find the institutions that win higher, the best and the brightest people, and not all those people are going to be from any one population, but these institutions are highly intolerant of discrimination, and I would dare say, particularly intolerant of any semitism. So you have to disambiguate institutions that are going to do well, institutions that are going to fail. The institutions that are going to fail tend to like discrimination, malas, malays, political intrigue, and bigotry. The institutions that do well reject those things, and you're going to see that in America and all over the world, and that's good for everyone, and it's good for the fight against any semitism. Well, Albert, does it change your view on hiring? You hire from these elite institutions and colleges and universities, where we've seen a lot of these protests break out. Does it change a way you think about it, about hiring from those schools? I'm not at all. We are going to hire the people that we think are the best, and this is your element of where they study. What is saddening me, it is that a lot of these institutions are not all, and not the entire faculty, but there were very unfortunate moments in those institutions. But this doesn't mean that they don't still represent the brightest and the best. Rachel, I want to give you the last word, and just what you've made of today, and what you want people to take away of this, I think you need gathering of corporate executives and lawmakers. I absolutely agree. I think that the combination of having a room of incredibly influential, powerful, intelligent, curious people, always good ideas come about in an environment like that. My husband and I wake up every morning and we say, hope is mandatory. It's not a suggestion, it's not advice, it's absolutely a command that we give to ourselves, it's an obligation. I would challenge everybody to stay hopeful. And you can listen to the full 26 minute interview on our Money Movers podcast.
