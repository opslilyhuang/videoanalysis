TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning, everyone. It's absolutely, we're delighted. I'm John, by the way, and this is Scott. We're delighted to spend a few minutes with you to talk a little bit about our journey with Palantir. I'm going to talk a little bit about the strategy, contextualize the work a little bit. Scott will then spend a little bit of time on some of the improvements we've made in our health system. And we're really a microcosm of what's going on around the country. So our general attitude is, if you can do it in TGH, or in Florida Health Sciences Center, which is our organization, you can do it anywhere in the United States. We'd like to start with, what I'd like to start off with, is just a little bit of context. So in our country right now, quality and health care is average. Quality, clinical outcome safety, it's average at best. There are systems across the country that are doing incredibly important work and making impact in their communities, but we're not moving the needle at a national level. And when you look at cost, cost is stagnant. It fluctuates somewhere between 17 and 21 percent of the GDP. And that's not sustainable. It's a luxury that quality is on and cost is on. They're not sustainable. Something has to change. And something has to change at scale. We believe that one of the ways to do this, not the only way, but one of the ways to do this, is to engage organizations like Palantir in leveraging data and moving very, very quickly. And that's the beginning of our journey. Recognizing that what I just shared with you was sort of the backdrop of our challenges, not just at TGH and Florida Health Sciences, but also across the country, we started to begin to a journey to look at kind of ways to get after this. Health care is a data rich industry. But what tends to happen in health care organizations across the country, and quite frankly across the world when I travel globally, the problems are similar. And in a lot of data, we don't know what to do with it. Our journey at TGH is to take data, turn that into information, take that information, turn that into knowledge, take that knowledge, and then act on it. Put it in the hands of clinicians and operators so they can make decisions, they can make improvements, and they can do that in a sustainable, reproducible way, and build real resiliency in the health system, and to do that at scale and quickly. We started that journey. I shared a book that I read through my doctorate called, Competing on Analytics, the new Science of Winning. It's a wonderful book. It's a dry read. I joke with Scott. He might have been the only one on my team that read the book, Cover to Cover, besides me. But it started us to think a little bit differently. So what Scott's going to do, he's going to take us through a few of our improvements, and then I'll finish things up in a moment. Thank you, John. And I think what you can see is when you make leveraging analytics, a strategy that's driven from the very top of the organization with leading with the CEO and all of the executives, and including all of the layers and levels of management, it's extremely powerful. And in healthcare, we have this horrible habit of not doing as much as we can with data. We're literally sitting on petabytes of data. John's right. We're still figuring out what to do with it, and there's so much we can do with it for research, for taking care of people, for improving our operations. And we started a relationship with Palantir just about 30 months ago, a relationship that was led by our chief technology officer and chief data officer that we expected was going to be a transaction for an analytics platform. But what we got was not that. What we got was a partnership. When those four deployed engineers kind of came in and matched up with our team, which is a very talented team, both of engineers and physician scientists and operators and frontline team members, incredibly powerful, and then a short amount of time. And just that small time, which in healthcare is a very short time, we've managed to accomplish a lot in that 30 month-ish time span. And this is usually where other health systems, in fact, probably the industry, and these aren't my numbers. This is Gartner. 89% of these analytic programs tend to fail to execute. And I'm standing here telling you that we are happy that we are not in that grouping. We're not that statistic. We're the other end of it. In fact, we're just getting started. In this short time, we've created situational awareness for our operators that they never had before on what's going on in a very complicated health system, a very busy academic medical center. We've developed some insights for our service lines that are emerging now and growing business so that we can see more patients. There are very sick patients that can't get access. And the faster that we move, the more people that we can see, the more people that we can treat and the healthier we can keep our community. Care pathways. This is a really important one for us. Safety and quality. Very front and center to what we do. We're very proud of what we've done with monitoring the treatment protocols for sepsis, which could be a very deadly condition for any patient. And just by the act of monitoring the treatment protocol and standardizing it, we've reduced those patients' length of stay by 30% in this short time. And that's less time for our patient to be inside the hospital and then getting out of the hospital and becoming healthy. And we've also saved hundreds of additional lives through this work, because septa seamy is the leading cause of death in any hospital in America. And by leveraging this technology, we're sending people home to their families, where otherwise they might have had a different outcome. Absolutely. That's really one of the most important things that we're doing, and we're walking the value of this data. We do things in all parts of our business. We've done things with foundry that support our revenue cycle. And we've done things with our operations, specifically our post-anesthesia care unit, with predictive analytics to help them put people in beds that come out of either surgery or procedure, and find the right beds at the right time, because you can imagine at a hospital, which is an academic medical center, with 1100 beds, we have at any given time of the day, probably 12 or 1300 patients in motion, and it's a constant math problem. And we've done amazing work with Palantir, with our team, to improve the flow. So again, we get patients in the right place at the right time. And finally, I would say we've done a lot to help support our clinical staffing and environmental services, just by doing some math to help them do some things that were really kind of manual tasks before. They were long division by hand, and we're supporting our leaders now with information and insight, so that they can staff their team correctly and lower the cost of healthcare. So, looking ahead, some of the next things ahead, we've got a long list of what's next. Because we've got such a long list, and we've had really great success so far, and we've got a strong team around it, and a great partnership with Palantir, we've extended that partnership by seven years. We've just signed a new seven-year agreement to help us really kind of keep going, and work down through that long list of things that we want to do. And we are very aggressive about strategy and some of the things that we want to do. Palantir is going to be front and center for everything that we do to accelerate everything that we want to do going forward. And with that, I'm going to hand it back over to John, as he wraps up to tell you a little bit about an exciting piece of our next chapter with Palantir. Thanks, Scott. So, as the CEO of the Health System, Palantir is a strategic differentiator for us. So, it's not just improving service outcome and cost for the organization and for the patients that we serve, and that's a little over six million patients that we are responsible for in our community, but it has become their teams have become strategic, and they're helping us differentiate the work that we're doing in the community and across the state, and in some cases across the country. Not only did we sign a seven-year deal a few weeks ago, and we recently, I think yesterday, we announced it, but they're also coming into our medical and research district. This is a picture of the city of Tampa. This is a cluster of services that are represented through Tampa General Hospital in the USF, the University of South Florida, and USF Health. Palantir will have a flag and help us build our innovation center for the future, so we can continue to grow, continue to expand, continue to innovate for our industry, because what we want to also do is share the great work that is being done across the ecosystem. It's been wonderful being with you. Thank you for your time and enjoy your day, everybody. You
