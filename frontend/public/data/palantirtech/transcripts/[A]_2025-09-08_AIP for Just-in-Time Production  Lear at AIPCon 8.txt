Please welcome vice president global advanced 
manufacturing at Lear, Jennifer Johnson. [Music] All right, good morning. My name is Jennifer 
Johnson and I am here to share a glimpse into the journey of Palanteer Foundry at Lear 
Corporation. Lear is a global leader in automotive seating and e systems. Our team of 
more than 173,000 employees across 37 countries designs, manufactures, and delivers advanced 
technologies to the world's leading automakers. With over 100 years of heritage, Lear is 
the largest US-based automotive supplier, proudly headquartered in Michigan. Guided by our 
commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and sustainability, Lear's global team 
is shaping the future of mobility with solutions that enhance comfort, safety, and 
efficiency. The automotive industry dynamics and resulting operational complexities are 
endless. To assist our team in navigating through the realities of today's marketplace, 
we are working to support our employees and our customers through our Palanteer Foundry 
platform. And we haven't looked back. Never underestimate the ability of a small group 
of dedicated people to change the world. Isn't that how the saying goes? And a couple of years 
ago at Lear, it was exactly that. a small group of dedicated people who built our first use case 
with Palunteer. It's easy for me to stand here and summarize the road that we've traveled since 
that initial use case. And depending on where you are in your journey with Foundry, you already know 
it's no joke. It's not an out-of-the-box solution. It's not a flip the switch project. Value through 
Foundry is extracted through a deep relationship with the Palunteer team and a long-term investment 
of time and resources from within an organization. So back to that initial use case, it built the 
foundation of manufacturing production support at Lear. And from that initial use case, we built 
more involving our manufacturing execution system integration and further monitoring applications. 
Next, we built into our supply chain and that positions us to our current ambition, dynamic 
decision-making in support of just in time seat assembly. So, let's turn our attention to JIT 
operations to understand more about what I'm referring to for automakers to offer a broad range 
of options for customers like you and me. Their models are designed to accommodate thousands 
of end item vehicle versions. So, as a tier one supplier, Lear's processes must be optimized 
to meet very tight requirements. So, I'm talking about product complexity delivered just in time 
with the highest quality and of course the lowest cost. Lear only has a 4-hour broadcast window from 
the time a fixed customer order is placed to the time a seat must be present at the seat install 
point within an automaker's assembly plant. There are on average 350 unique part numbers that 
are picked and staged that are components within a seat. After assembly, seed is all seats are 
inspected and tested for fit and function. They are then readied for a sequenced delivery 
to our customer assembly plant. The point I'm trying to make here is that a just in time 
seat operation is a very intense environment. We're shipping seeds at 60 jobs an hour, 24 hours 
a day, 5 days a week. Considering Lear's global scale of over 175 just in time plants, thousands 
of decisions are made daily to po to both secure ontime delivery and also optimize our processes. 
So, sounds like a great opportunity for an AIP powered Foundry application, don't you think? 
Well, we thought so. So, let's take a closer look and join the team in Flint, Michigan to see what's 
going on today. Welcome to the JIT control tower, where operations teams start their day. The 
control tower is a real time bird's eye view of Lear's operation. On the left, we see the 
production line status. It's a continuous influx of orders and deliveries. And on the map we see 
a highle routing of incoming material from tier 2 suppliers located across North America. These 
are components and subsystems and route from other leer sites or other thirdparty suppliers. 
So how do we do it? How do we orchestrate the convergence of a continuous flow of customer 
customer demand with the right material and the right resources on hand exactly at the right time. 
We do this through dynamic production scheduling. To optimize production scheduling, we combine 
the expertise of our operations team and our engineering team with Foundar's AIP horsepower. In 
this view, we're experiencing the conbound board. This is a pipeline of activities and actions that 
together execute to a schedule that our teams monitor. During a shift, dynamic line scheduling 
is informed through the integration of multiple applications. If you remember those use cases I 
mentioned earlier, these applications reconcile things like inbound material availability, 
real time production throughput, and finished good inventory capacity. At the most left is our 
exceptions board and our planners spend their time there interfacing, triaging and closing concerns 
in material availability or production alerts, anything that may impact our most time-sensitive 
deliveries. And our teams are trained to react to exceptions. At times, our customer demand 
is within that 4hour window that they set. This means customers are asking us to break 
that schedule that we planned and expedite what we all call a hot job. AIP alerts us now 
of a hot job and our ops team engages to assess the best alternatives within the schedule 
to deliver. Planners run the AI agent, our scheduling agent and its power to assess our bill 
of materials and standard labor content involved. The scheduling agent offers options to allocate 
the job during the shift. The resulting impact to the schedule and inventories on hand is 
considered. So I point out a hot job as an example. It's a perfect example of how AIP and 
the Lear turn team up on the production floor. Foundry delivers the decision layer while 
the plant operations team brings practical product and supply chain and manufacturing 
know-how. Engineering assesses complexity through simulation while foundry ingests inputs, 
finds the best slot, and makes a proposal. Last, operations reviews the plan, considers the next 
best alternative, and approves or escalates if needed. When ready, the job is placed and written 
back to Lear's MEES system. As we build the JIT control tower and new AI agents, we have our 
global manufacturing team in mind. We just reviewed one line and one plant. Multiply that by 
hundreds of plants and as many operations teams making those thousands and thousands of decisions 
daily. I find the most rewarding part of deploying Foundry applications are the aha moments. And 
we all have them. It's the moment a production planner realizes he no longer must spend hours 
each day pouring over Excel spreadsheets and on conference calls reconciling and onhand inventory 
with his uh Mexican counterparts. And it's the moment the plant manager realizes she now has 
a digital assistant supporting her ability to execute more effectively in her 24-hour a day, 
5day a week operating rhythm. In conclusion, Foundry allows us to focus on what matters, 
keeping our plants running smoothly and delivering the highest quality product to our customer. And 
many thanks to the Palunteer team for supporting us along the way as we solve for our greatest 
opportunities. Thank you so much. [Music]
