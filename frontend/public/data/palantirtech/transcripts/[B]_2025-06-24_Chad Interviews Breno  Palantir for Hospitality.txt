TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm Chad Wolquist. I'm an architect at Palantir today. I've got Brenna who leads our Palantir hospitality business. Thanks for joining me in Arkansas. Yeah, thank you for having me here. Yeah, first time in Arkansas, I was enjoying it. Yeah, I know you travel a lot. You're in hotels as your perfect person to lead our hospitality business. Yeah, I mean, we all at Palantir travel a lot. I mean, I leave in hotels that's that's how I explain how what I do to my parents. Yeah. So what is it that you do at Palantir? Like how long you've been here? Maybe a little background? Yeah, I have been a Palantir for about five years. My starting Palantir is an intern. So I work it in product development actually in our Gotham product, which is our defensive intelligence product in a in a product that's called Nexus Fury. If you know, you know, kind of like I'm sure there will be a few people out there that know. Yeah, for sharing data among Gotham instances. From there, when I came back, I started working as a Delta, which we call for deployed engineers like our engineers on the front line on the business. I started working in Brazil for COVID response. And then and brother Latin America from there, I evolved into the Brazil business until I think like early last year when I started like hospitality. And hospitality can be like any services industry. If you think I really like hotels and cruises and like things related to the travel industry because I think those is a very strong place of hours. But it could be for example, entertainment industry as well is a pretty strong one or restaurants. I think like it's translatable there as well. Yeah. And they all are very operational businesses, right? And I think that's where we are really good is is operational decision making stuff happens. How do I make the right decision in this moment? I think that's where we bring all the data together to like help our customers do that. Yeah, exactly. And I like how how I make your business adaptable or our business adaptable. Like we basically connect their systems and like make them able to react to changes and react to like unforeseen situations in a much more quick care way in a much more digital way. Which allows them to like basically like focus their brand power and their expertise on like how I like serve my customer how I make them have the best experience. And like or how I make my business more money how I make my business save money, right? So like all of those you save like time from from your people to do those things as well. Yeah. And I think the the thing there of connecting the different pieces moving from local optimization each of those to that global not only for a customer experience, but for revenue and saving money. I think that's like super powerful. And you know, it's it's also super complex. And like we honor the complexity of people's businesses that are human and systems and all of these things interacting. And so like really it's like how do we meet people where they are? It's like yeah, how do I help the person, the maintenance person understand the most pressing issue whether or the customer service agent, how to best service this customer. And so it's really about enabling your people to do more to be more customized. It's not about trying to replace them. Exactly. And like when when you say about making our business adaptable like in the other day, host-fired businesses is like kind of like you're saving people and like people create them for same situations like there's several examples. So like if you think about your business, you have like hundreds or like thousands of locations is like and sometimes they are close by and sometimes they're in the same city. Let's say you made a reservation at one location and you show up at another location in the same city. Like that business happens like, okay, what do I do now? Do I receive this customer here? Do I send them back? How? Why? And like kind of like all those decisions and like kind of like fast decision making and like kind of ensuring your customer have the best experience possible and like kind of like you are serving what they need and and also like of course making the revenue you need, making the margins you need is also like part of what we can help those businesses with. So it's really about empowering your people. Exactly. Through technology. The one other way I think about this, what you're talking about is like stuff happens. And normally a person has a limited context of what they're able to see in the moment to make a decision. So I've got local context to make a locally optimized decision. And I think this is where our software really helps is how do we empower that person to make a globally optimized decision in the moment, whether you're on the factory floor, you're in front of a customer at a desk, you're on a cruise, wherever that is, how do we help that person make the best decision in the global context? And it's more context that they have the they can have access to at any point in a human context, one to essentially. And so I think that's where the ontology comes in is contextualizing what's happening on the ground in the real world so that when something happens, that is how I make that decision. And I think that's like super powerful like you're talking about is chaos is going to happen. We can't plan for everything as much we want to plan. Yeah. Things happen. Exactly. Especially like when you get humans in the way like things will happen. And the real power of the ontology, like when they talk about several different use cases, we talk about procurement, stock of supply chain, customer service and so on. If you think about the ontology is like one ontology for all of those use cases, so you can actually see your business from end to end with it. So when you think about, for example, procurement, let's say you need to buy that's the food that's the beverage that's just item for your business because like your customer everyone that and then you have like the customer service. This is all the same thing. And you want like when that customer shows up to your venue or to your hotel or to your place, you have that item for him on the shelf ready. And that matters like end to end. One example is like when you think about we have a customer that's a luxury hotel, I mean you're a spitter on that bootcamp. So you know. I know those guys well. Yeah. Yeah. And if you think about them, for example, it's in the night resorts and like they have like very high end service. Right. If a customer goes in and they always order the same champagne, right. And you want that champagne on the shelf for that customer, you need to be able to connect all those sides of the business. Yeah. And I think that's what people like when you think about the business use cases is that when you talk about connected company, it kind of sounds like just a marketing term, but truly is connected operations all the way from the demand signal of I've got a customer coming to all the way through your business operations back to procurement. And then forward to I got that now I have to have in the right place because this customer's coming. So it's that back and forth operational flow. And that's something I think we're like it's hard for people to understand is like it's a data analytics tool. Yes, we do data analytics tool, but that should be the byproduct. What you're talking about is operational workflows in the context of hospitality is this connected decision making across your business to facilitate these use cases. Like you said, they're all the same procurement is in service of the customer, the customer service engine helps people service the customer better and all these things that are connected by that fabric of ontology, right. You always need to work on the premise that the person at the front line of your business kind of like has some knowledge and you want to be able to capture that on a digital way to basically like use that edge for for your business. So what what are you most excited about when it comes to AI and hospitality? Yeah, I think like what I'm most excited about it's an industry in my view that like has has been media of tech for a very long time. You have all those underlying systems and like a PMS a great example and like you have a lot of data structure and unstructure. I think like the unstructure has been not utilized a lot. The classic example that everyone can relate to is like a review. Everyone already submitted a review to a hotel in the past and like that thing is like very rich on the data. Some people put on like what happened to their room who served them well, who didn't and like you can actually like plug that data pull that data and like utilize it to enhance your business, make your business perform better and it has been really unlocked in the past few years with AI. So that really excites me and like it can like skip the journey for a lot of those hospitality companies that that have been like with these systems for for a very long time sort of like migrating from one of the other jumping in right into like impact and results. Yeah, I mean I think it's a similar thing I see in whether it's manufacturing. I have a bunch of points, I have solutions. I try to make them work together. Human is the glue between them, whether it's emails, phone calls, I have multiple screens and switching between Excel, whatever it is back to that same concept of moving from locally optimized in each one of those point solutions to globally optimized to know that in my RAM it's connected as PMS and how those then connect. It's really about scale. It's like how do I help my people scale instead of being data gofers trying to do these things? It's like how do I help and code these? One way to simplify the ontology wording as all that I like is like the vocabulary of her business, the words. So when you think about the hotel example is like is your guests, is your property, is your staff, right? All of those things are like words of her business when you think about it. So like when you think about ontology and hostility is really about all of those. So it's the things that like your customers see but sometimes they think that your customer don't see as well. So it's not only like the customer facing part but also like the internal operations part. And we basically model that by connecting all of their systems. So we connect like the PMS, reputation management, CRM, procurement system, invoicing the traditional European, like what not you name it? Like we connect all of that into the system and it basically creates this translation of what is the vocabulary of your business. So what are the person on the front desk or the person on your brokerage or an error venue talks about things about and then we codify that into volunteer, right? But I think it's different. I just want to call this out as different than like a data warehouse. Like people think, oh, I have a data like I bring a data together and I have a data warehouse like that's very much a report to KPI. What we're talking about is it's operational. It's decision-centric system like taking actions. Exactly. Exactly. Kind of like when we model that that ontology that's kind of like as it's a vocabulary of your business is like like you can put AI and you can put AI to kind of like understand your business and ultimately you can make AI take decisions for you. So like for example, one example that I love is like we have an AI that like reads your reviews. It reads kind of like who we state and who we tell and who not. And kind of like it's just like, okay, this review cited that this room has a problem in the shower head. And like kind of like it automatically like creates an action and like sends this to the maintenance person. So the next time a maintenance person goes to your room or like the cleaning person goes to a room to clean your room, they will tell them to kind of like take a look at the shower head see see if you can fix it because like the customer's side of that problem and like the tree previous customers also cited that problem. So it's kind of like and they I can only take that decision because your data is in that format and that vocabulary right that like semantic human way of putting things. The now's in verbs of how you operate and everything. Exactly. But we've been doing this in other industries whether it's in airlines or on factory tours. Preventative maintenance is key to keep a line up or an airplane flying. Yeah. A similar kind of concept can be applied to keeping you know hotel rooms open and you know being able to be serviced for customers. Right. Yeah. Keeping them open and like also like reducing the cost of like the maintenance. Right. Like if you can tackle tree maintenance problems in one goal is like it's better than one-to-one for example and then things like that. Yeah. Being very strategic or waiting for something to break so bad you got to replace everything right. So those are the kind of things that we look for. Exactly. Yeah. And like yeah. The ontology piece is like super super powerful and it allows us to kind of like also build the the agentic action workflows and those can be like things that affect also your customer. We are talking a lot about things that like are on the back of the hotel. So like we we're thinking about the procurement or the maintenance or the revenue management. Right. So things that the customer don't see I mean the customer see the price but like you get the idea but we can put the AI stick decisions in front of the customer as well if you want right. So you can take it put the AI it's kind of like for example pick up a phone call if you wish or like kind of like answer your customer ticket like maybe the customer complain that like the about something on the loyalty program right and like you can go in and put the AI to fix that problem for him. Yeah and I've even seen where now you can you can text and the agent can understand what you're needing and actually create a work order or have something delivered for the room just via text and understanding so that like that automatic workflow then allows the human to still have the human touch of delivering or doing something but they're not having to pick up the phone call and decipher what to go do and so I think that's that a great example of the AI's doing the ordinary and the humans are doing the extraordinary. The chat is really like step zero of the thing. Yeah. Like what you want is like your AI taking business decisions for you and like supporting your business is like it's like not the support role but like the active role kind of like driving your business forward and and that's what we really are about. Yeah very cool. Well thanks for joining me here in our zone. I learned a lot about what we're doing hospitality. I love that it really is just a different flavor of different pieces that we're doing in other business so thanks for joining me. Yeah I mean thank you for having me in Arkansas. Yeah post-todd is like a great business for Pondter. I bet like every also Pondter engineer is a super user of like hotels and loyalty so like it's a good point to hotels for deployed I leave it for months in hotels for why I've been deployed in the Pondter and like transforming those businesses nowadays is I would say super rewarding for me. Yeah I love that like you know as engineers have volunteered like we see all the different customer workflows in our daily lives and I think it's pretty cool that you're like staying at hotels that you're helping optimize the user experience. That's a pretty cool feedback loop. Yeah it's a cool feedback loop and I always like learn things so sometimes I've arrived to a hotel and like oh what system are you using like does it work well does it does it on what we should have like interacting with people I always learn so I also love that. That's awesome that's key to being for deployed is always learning.
