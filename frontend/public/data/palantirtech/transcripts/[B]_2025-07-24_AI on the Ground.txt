TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

My name is Laura D. Cardenas and I'm a registered nurse here at Tampa General Hospital. The last 17 years I've been able to serve the neuro intensive care unit where we care for the most vulnerable and critical care patients. So before utilizing AI, it would take hours to gather information, looking in chart reviews, talking to nurses, talking to physicians. We relied on paper, pencil, a lot of papers stapled together with sometimes outdated data by the time I was done going through 32 patients. And this is how we would try and give reports. Having me in AI, it has significantly changed the culture on the unit. I had a charge nurse who never gave a multidisciplinary round or report out. She came on a board, said, this is an amazing tool. Look at this. It has all my information already gathered and collected and she was able to report out on the patients. It was completely user friendly. She's like, Laura, what is this? It is creating excitement throughout the nursing community. Using AI has provided more time to be with you or your loved one at the bedside where nurses should be. We are the heart of healthcare. Matt Trautman, the vice president general manager for PRL Industries, supplier of components for nuclear submarines. Out of service men and women, lives depend on. We are a fully integrated foundry, boring metal all the way through Finnish machine components. Two months ago, we weren't getting after any of the problems on the shot floor. Engineering director told me all his team was doing was quoting a three day process to quote apart paper files, old archives, data tables, emails, side communications, all this which ends up getting lost in the fray. Now using an AI tool, they are getting halfway through that process in minutes. We've got to freeze them up to get back out in the floor and do it an engineer does best, which is solve problems. To provide the Navy with the best quality products in the shortest amount of time, this is what AI is going to help us do. Understanding part location and status, that is a game changer. We can now talk very clearly with the customer. If that part is now to become the primary focus of the business because it's a critically need to part for a ship construction, you get notified. It's an automatic notification. We can see the exact status here is the impact. How can we be better? How can we do more? And this is how we were answering that call. With AI, we match the speed of the quality management process to the speed of the workforce and the machine capabilities. And we will truly see a multi-step change in the amount of product that can come out of any company in this supply chain. More jobs for American workers here at PRO. My name is Julie Nordberg. I'm a registered nurse leader here at UP Health's Simmar Cat, from the heart of Michigan's Alpha Peninsula. And we are really the only game in town, as I'd like to say it. The next closest hospital to us at Conservasos is downstate, which is about a four hour drive. Prior to using AI, it took a lot of time to go through the patient's charts to see what they need to be. It took a lot of time just to try to communicate with people. I think that's a fear that everybody has is that AI is going to replace people, but AI in the ways being used here could never replace our frontline staff. You know, the vibe is, I think it's just one of excitement that everybody's just proud to be part of this. And to say that we're doing it here, and we're honing it in and tweaking it and using it to enhance our care and using it to help our staff having this kind of communication hub and facility snapshot has helped, has helped everybody. For the nursing staff, I think being able to see everything in one spot is just revolutionized kind of how they are able to provide care. I don't think anybody is sad to get rid of a meeting. The impact on patients is earlier detection, which means earlier treatment, which is a better outcome, life saving for some of them. That's where I think this is going to help us a lot is because we don't have as much manpower as those big academic centers. But having the AI in the background doing some of that like work for us is huge. I joined Pecknut in 2018. We have built over 11 billion batteries in the last eight years. I walked out onto their massive production floor for the first time. I knew right then and there. I wanted to make this technology accessible for anyone who wanted to learn it. People coming from the tourism industry and the hospitality industry, quite a few technicians that have fixed slot machines in a past life, people from automotive companies, people who are used to repairing cars. However, have never seen equipment at this scale and with this complexity. We don't really have to pick and choose what people's backgrounds are because we do have this very powerful learning tool that makes it easy for anyone to be able to enter this industry. It is taking our historical maintenance records, pairing it with our machine data, and as now starting to understand early warning signs of a breakdown and deploy our technicians to equipment before it ever actually breaks. This helps minimize our production losses, keep our technicians safer, we're taking reactive events, turning them into predictive events. We used to honestly lose a lot of technicians because they would lose their confidence, think, hey, maybe it's isn't for me. I pulled the supervisor off the floor and said, hey, you gotta come loose into this idea. And you have to help us make it better because you're the one who lives it every day. And they immediately started suggesting new features. They were telling us what was wrong with the old systems and we were coming up with solutions on the spot. So this is really helping people feel like they belong here. We don't believe AI should replace human talent. We believe it should elevate it. Our workers are very excited. They have a tool that they can turn to to help them learn at their own pace. It really puts the power back into their hands.
