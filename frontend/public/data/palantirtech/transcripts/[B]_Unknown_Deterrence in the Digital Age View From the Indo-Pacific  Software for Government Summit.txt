TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Well, it is a real treat to bring three people that both personally and professionally really admire on stage with me to have a discussion. But before we kick off, I wanted to tee up a quick video because we all, you know, we've heard a lot of talking and it's time to watch a little video sort of get us into the mood for the discussion we're going to have. So, so maybe over to the video. There is a growing consensus that the people's Republic of China may try to use force against Taiwan in pursuit of its one China policy. A massive military modernization program, access to cutting-edge commercial technology, more realistic training, advances in artificial intelligence, and territorial expansion in the South China Sea has made China a more technologically advanced and capable adversary than ever before. In just a few decades, Taiwan's semiconductor years, Taiwan has lived under the threat of us military would be called on to defend Taiwan. While some of these actions may be symbolic, they carry significant risk of escalation. These developments put enormous pressure on the United States and other countries that seek to deter China's aggression in the region. Software has a critical role to play in fielding a complete picture of the battle space, facilitating collaboration on complex courses of action with mission partners, leveraging commercial and national satellite constellations, unlocking AI-enabled decision-making at the edge, and breaking through the noise to extract signal, and disadvantaged, disconnected, and degraded environments. Software can help deliver decision-making advantage to deter and defend. All right. I'm going to first start off with my good friend, Rihanna. You just returned from Beijing just very shortly. A group of discussions with the People's Liberation Army. I wanted to get a sense of sort of from your perspective, what is Beijing trying to achieve? What is their intent? What do they want to achieve, particularly in the Western Pacific, that we should be concerned about? So, I think for anyone who looks at China, studies, China, speaks Chinese, reads what they write, listens to what they say, they've actually been extremely clear about what their intentions have been. I think probably 15 years ago I started giving talks on stages like this, that the Chinese want to be the dominant power in Asia, and they want the US military gone. And when I was in Beijing talking about these issues 15 years ago, I think most of them felt like, what a waste of time to invite this professor, because she is telling us something that we all know. Like coming to the United States and being like, they have three branches of government. It's like, okay, they pay you over there for that kind of analysis. But I think generally speaking, this idea that we could convince China, they're better off being number two, because we provide some public goods that never flew there. They really want what they call strategic space, which is the ability to make decisions that they feel are best for them without having to worry about how other countries respond. And part of that is what we see as deterrence is constraints for them. And so they want that gone. Now I think we can open it up to the debate about whether they want that level of military power globally, of which I personally believe they want to rely mainly on political and economic tools to achieve their goals beyond Asia. But without a doubt, they want to be the dominant military power in that region. And so how would you evaluate sort of the military balance, looking at it from the perspective of Beijing? What do you see as the military balance? And to what degree is there sort of mix of both sort of hardware and software play in the way in which they approach this? So I think that the number one thing with the Chinese military modernization is besides it going extremely quickly, it has been really successful in a number of key areas. So when you look at the hardware component of it, when I first started looking at the Taiwan straight balance, for example, my first job out of college, I co-edited a book on the topic. And this was in 2004, 2005, where their invasion plan was to come and dear a bunch of ships and try to paddle their way over. One of the first papers I presented was on their destroyer. They got the first ship base defenses. So back in the day, there wasn't a lot of concern, but the Chinese focused very heavily on modernizing their forces. So their services had about 0 to 4% of modern equipment. Now the majority of the equipment is modern. Then they focused on building a lot of it. So now we know they have more ships than the US Navy. And in the last 10 years, the focus has really been on this soft component. So it's not just the equipment they have and how much of it they have, but Xi Jinping did an evaluation of his forces and came to a conclusion that probably Putin should have come to before he invaded Ukraine. He said to his military, you guys have a lot of fancy stuff. I don't think you know how to use any of it. And a big component of that is what the Chinese refer to as sort of informationized, informationalized war, depending on how you want to translate Xi Jinping. And so they then wanted not only the capability to impact US forces, but the capability to project power themselves. And a big component of that was building this C4ISR structure. The soft and digital aspect of this is really key from a perceptions, deterrence, and escalation perspective. I am not someone who has an expert in technology, more of how technology impacts decision-making. This modernization process was largely geared to making sure the military could conduct joint operations. And the only thing right now that is keeping China from using force against Taiwan is that they don't feel that in the soft modernization sense, in terms of the caliber quality and training of their military, they're ready yet. They don't feel like they're ready to execute a joint operation. A big component of this has to do with the lack of faith in decision-making. There's a number of reasons for this. The system is very centralized. They used to do a paid-of-promote situation, which made it seem like you should listen to the person above me. But they've always been very focused on centralizing control over ISR strike and support functions. They want that human machine interaction to make it so they are confident in decision-making. While the United States, we want people in the loop. We feel calmer and happier when people are making the decisions. The Chinese are really excited about the prospect of software machines making those decisions for them. They don't have to rely on their people. The concern is as they go more in that direction to digitize their military, regardless of the actual capabilities, they are going to become more and more confident in their ability to execute the types of operations that they might need to against Taiwan, which will make them harder to deter. That's pretty concerning. Scott, I'm going to turn to you. You've spent a career sort of looking at these things. From your perspective, first of all, what is the United States trying to achieve? Are we prepared to deal with the kinds of challenges that Oriana has laid out here? We've got a couple of hours. We've got 37 minutes. It's complicated. It comes to where you start and answering a question like that. I think where it starts is where you sit. One of the advantages that I have now being out of uniform is people expect me to bring a military perspective. I actually try to diminish the military perspective and talk about how critical it is that we look at this competition that we're having with the PRC from a whole of government perspective. It was interesting. I paused when you asked Oriana the question about the balance of power of military power. That's important to keep track of. I think it's more important to keep track of the balance of power between U.S. national power and PRC national power. On the discussion of how do we manage our power? I think we have to do better. This is the first time that we've truly been in a peer competition with another country. I don't think that we're being thoughtful enough about it. I guess an answer to your question. What is the U.S. strategy? My answer is I'm not sure. It appears to be a strategy of knitting together a bunch of actions and tying those into a broader strategy. Oriana's point, I really think this competition is really about the international rules based order and the mechanisms that we use to manage power across free and open Pacific to Channel Prime Minister Abe and as liberal democracies. We have our differences, but we have a rule set to govern how we resolve those differences on the national stage. As I'm channeling you a little bit, I may be misquoting you or giving you words that are not directly that you commented on. That is that the PRC is not comfortable with that. It's a control mechanism. I'll use AI as an example that Oriana again touched to. It's a really interesting debate that we're having in the United States back to your question of what is our strategy. I do think that the PRC is embracing AI as a critical tool to help them get after the objectives that Oriana spelled out. But it's a control tool. A comment that I made to someone earlier is that PRC thinks of AI as a way to control the force if you're talking about a military perspective or control the people if you're talking about a civil perspective or to control the government if you're talking about a government perspective. My view on AI is part in answering your question of things that we need to do. We need to think of AI as a way to free the force, to free the people and to free the government. That's not just a turnkey. You don't just go do it. When I think the debates that are going on in this town are critically important. But I think our approaches are very, very different. In the interactions that I've had with PRC counterparts, it is all about control. The ability to comment that you mentioned decision advantage is baked into liberal democracies and more so of the United States than anywhere else. Our ability to delegate authority comes naturally to us. In our academic institutions and our government institutions and our military institutions. But more than that, our ability to delegate authorities while retaining responsibility for the decisions made, that was my fault. I shouldn't have delegated those authorities to you. It is antithetical to how the PRC thinks how the PLA operates. So I think it's a great question, but I would be careful about rushing to an answer. I think there needs to be a broader debate not only with this country, but with our allies and partners in the context of what is it that we should be doing to counter the threat to the institutions that have been established for so long that is brought by both Russia and the PRC. So Kerry, you've been looking at this stuff for years now. What should be some of our priorities as we are looking at this interplay between both Beijing pursuing really a set of objectives that fundamentally threaten the way in which we think the international system should be ordered and the way in which power should be shared. And what should be some of the things that we should be wrestling with here in the sea? I know you certainly look at this every day in your think tank role and you certainly got to wrestle with it inside the department. So some of your thoughts? Well, I'm a little worried here because we have the retired admiral that talked about policy strategy and now you're going to have the policy won't talk about military issue. Of course. I don't know. But back to your earlier discussion with Orianna, from everything that I've seen and from the scholarly work that she and others have done, I mean China, they do want to win without fighting. Nobody wants to have to make that decision to send thousands of un-thousands of young men and women into battle to die. China is, they believe they are in catch-up mode. And so you see language coming out of their documentation. We want to match. You know, we want to surpass. And I do agree. I think there's a military component there, but they're broader global ambitions. They are very much economic in nature. And so we now have this challenge, I think, unlike we did in the Soviet era where it was much more of a military competition now. We have this nexus between the military, national security and economic security. However, if Xi makes that political decision, he's not going to go in with what Arm Tide behind his back. I mean, he is going to want to maintain that battlefield advantage and keep the United States out. So it's things like countering our C4 ISR, countering our mobilization and logistics abilities, perhaps targeting our critical infrastructure to degrade our will here at home. So those are the things that I would be looking for. I think from a US perspective, some of our priorities, we need to be able to keep that state of deterrence, deter the conflict from happening. I really liked Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks. She gave a speech a couple of weeks ago where she basically made the comment today is not the day. And this was something that we thought a lot about when I was in the department as well as what's in your toolkit to get Xi to wake up every day and think not today. I can't take on the US and its allies. They're too strong. And my forces aren't ready. So what are the things that we can do there? And I do make a bit of a linkage here and we can probably talk about it later between what's happening in Ukraine and Taiwan. Is it is important for China to see Putin lose? It's important for them to see the cost of the smaller country can impose on a larger one, especially when they have a will to fight. It's important for them to see degraded. What happens with the, you think it's a vaunted military and it's much less than what was thought. And then I really liked the comments earlier on control. I mean China has a system where it's very rigid in their command and their control. And what you're seeing on the Ukrainian battlefield is much more operational adaptability and flexibility. One of the things that really weighs on me is it is just the urgency. And whether you believe 2027 or not, I mean there is an urgency here that we need to be more prepared. Again, show that strength, get G to think not today. What I'm struck by though is that largely means you're fighting with the toolkit that you have today. I mean our systems just take so long, the hardware takes so long to develop. So that's really where I focus more on the integration and the software piece. How do you stitch together those capabilities that you have today, including commercial? And how do you automate those really manual processes? And in the ISR world, I mean I go into different op centers having the project Maven team which was superb under me. There were a lot of manual processes that we still undertake that software automation, machine learning could really speed up and help us in a time of conflict. So I think you're absolutely right. This sort of belief of how do we persuade Xi Jinping that today is not the day to roll the iron dice. It sits at the centerpiece of where the United States is. So maybe, and I'm going to change this up a little bit, Orianna, what would convince Xi Jinping that today is not the day? I mean, so I think we've all been searching for this. What is sufficient deterrence? What does that look like? And how do we do that? Particularly when they are certainly out producing us in the number of ships, they're certainly out producing us in the number of aircrafts. So if we think about sort of the hardware that makes up military power, it seems like we're not necessarily on track to persuade them that today is not the day. Well, I think the important thing here is about sort of risk acceptance and risk aversion. My assessment of the Chinese system is actually they're quite cautious. I mean, we look at it from the outside. We see that control. We see a heightened sort of willingness to use violence. I remember when I was in Beijing during some of the Hong Kong protests, some of my Chinese colleagues were like, why don't you keep on saying that Xi Jinping was so brutal in Hong Kong? He didn't kill everyone. Like he could have done that and he didn't. Like why isn't that the news story? So it's like they kind of look at these things slightly differently than we do. And so when it comes to Taiwan, I like to say that the war is inevitable, but we can delay it forever. Along those lines of today is not the day. I have no brilliant ideas of how to solve it. But in my assessment, what was really the main pathway to war is that once the military is ready, it is possible. It is not a miscalculation. It is a calculation that they could potentially take Taiwan very quickly before the United States can really mount a significant defense. And then we're in this political space where what's the US president going to do then? Once the Taiwan president has capitulated as a US president, going to declare war in China. So there's really these distinctions in our system between operationally what is possible and like politically some of the problems there. So I see that for Xi Jinping, if it looks like he can't have that quick victory right now because internally they assess they have serious disadvantages in protracted warfare. And there are the costs associated with a protracted conflict with the United States are too high and could potentially undermine what they referred to as national rejuvenation. So if they don't have that quick victory option, I don't think they're going to do it. Now slight caveat, as Matt mentioned, I just got back from a week of meetings in Beijing. And it was interesting because the party in the military supported my trip. So I got some really great meetings and access. But you always have to think like, why don't they do that? What is it that they're hoping that I get out of this to keep in mind how I value it? No, trying to watch your ever thinks. No one is ever suspicious of the... I'm like, what do you want me to get out of it? Besides, I'm supposed to come back and tell everyone don't worry, they're not going to rest you and throw you in jail. They're like, you want in jail, everything was fine. You know, go tell your friends. The other sort of message is because I write about this likelihood of war, it was very clear that they wanted me to believe that they would never use force. And they wanted me to come back to the United States because they're like, Chinese people don't kill Chinese people. And I'm like, what was that whole civil war about? And I'm like, oh, not that one. But in the end, what I took from it is... And this is somewhat of a new idea, but I'm going to express it publicly anyway. There is another pathway to war that I haven't given a lot of thought to. It makes me very concerned. And that is, when Xi Jinping has said that he wants progress towards reunification, I had a lot of discussions with people about what that means. I always thought, as long as Taiwan doesn't declare independence, or the United States like, doesn't put nuclear weapons in Taiwan, or something like that, you know, China's not going to use force outside of the scenario that I laid out. They're not going to risk a protracted war. But what it seems to be the case that they currently believe US policy is what it says in the communicates, which is that we support whatever happens as long as it's a decision made across the street. And they're starting to get suspicious that the US actually prefers the current status quo. Taiwan's the fact of independence. They don't believe that yet, but they're starting to get suspicious that the United States prefers for Taiwan not to be a part of China. Now I don't think it's controversial to say, and of course I didn't say it in the room that like, I think they're right. You know, when they lay it out, they're like, well, you say it's an unsinkable aircraft period. We can threaten you in the Second Island Chamber. That would be the case regardless of it happened peacefully or not. So are you saying it would be a problem if Taiwan was a part of China? You know, and I'm like, well, that's kind of a problem. So when we talked about that, then they started to say, well, if it were the case that that was US policy, then there's no level of military power that will deter us. Then I had Chinese counterparts be like, you will lose. We will fight until sort of the end. And so this has made me start to think that we need to, you know, I believe the military deterrence is very important. The Chinese don't mention that at all when they mention all the things that they're upset about. When I asked them, like, you know, why do you think we're changing the status quo in Taiwan? They list all the political stuff. And they're like, oh, you know, Congressional visits, passing of these laws. And I really have to directly ask, like, what about the new base in the Philippines? What about the additional forces in southwest Japan? And then they're like, oh, yeah, I guess we don't like that either. But it's not the main thing in their mind, which makes me think we have a lot of space to really enhance this military deterrence, which will help us. We always think military's provocative political is not. But in my view, it's actually the opposite in this scenario that we need to build up our military in the region. And we need to tone it down on trying to expand Taiwan's political space. Which will be very difficult given an election season in Taiwan and everything else. And in the United, it is a politically fraught situation. This is one of the great things about being a tenure track professor. Is that like I can say to policymakers, you know, like President Biden, you should really make a statement that you're not against peaceful reunification. I think he should do that. Is the US president going to do that? No. Which makes this alternative way of preventing this war happening? I don't know. More difficult. I just haven't come up with the pathway to peace in that scenario quite yet. So what you're saying is we've got a difficult job ahead of us on maintaining deterrence. So maybe Scott, from your perspective, you've talked a little bit about how, from a US perspective, how we view artificial intelligence and software, and certainly a long experience on the hardware side of this. What's the sort of mix that we should be thinking about from the capabilities that we have coming online today from commercial industry and the existing capabilities we have? What does that look like in being able to be able to sort of maintain the perception, the minds of our potential adversary that this will be extremely difficult for you, and therefore that military option is something that you should be looking for other ways to be able to resolve this problem. Yeah. So let me answer that question first by answering your previous question. I think Xi Jinping gets up every morning and says today's not the day. How do we get him to keep thinking this? That gets to the deterrence piece. If they decide to move, my bet is the trigger will occur in turn to either internal to China itself, or they will take advantage of an external challenge that the US and potential or allies and partners face, and choose to move not necessarily against Taiwan, but perhaps in the South China Sea as a test of commitment and resilience before they actually moved on Taiwan. But moving Taiwan is all about the stability in my mind of the Chinese Communist Party in that system that they've established to further their power. So the term in directly answering your question that comes to my mind is relevant. So there's two sides to the deterrence coin. One side is deterrence, and the other side is relevant. So we don't do enough assessments of deterrence. We say these things, and we do these things, and we put them under the rubric of deterrence. And we never go back and do the assessment. Does that actually deter them? So arguably, arguably the US has stepped back from allies and partners in recent history at least in their perspective. And the result of that has been, I think, fairly positive, perhaps not in my design, but we've got the free and open Asia Pacific from Prime Minister Abe. We've got Australia that stepped forward in reading meaningful ways and making a difference to sustain the stability in the region. It certainly is a deterrence factor. And it's relevant because the PRC is reacting to it. You've got the rejuvenation of EPCA and the Philippines. I mean, I could go on and on these various efforts, the Japanese budget and what they're funding for their own national security. The measures that they're taking and the tools that they're putting into their self-defense force toolbox is significant. They're partnering with Ukraine in meaningful ways. I could make the same comments about Korea. These are impactful. These are all beyond just the military component. I think Kerry mentioned this about how critical of sense of urgency is. I'm really not interested in 2027 because it could happen sooner. I've owned a house in San Diego for 35 years and I've had fire insurance. I can't wait for that thing to burn down so I can get a return on all that fire insurance that I've paid for it. But I pay my taxes so the fire department is ready to respond. That's what the military does. It's that insurance policy that if we get it wrong. So the way to get it right is to get engaged back to your question about strategy and to leverage as was commented in the presentation just before us, just before us, is the commercial sector because the commercial sector can move fast. The first solution to reach for is the software solutions and the optimized systems that we have now to your point, we're going to fight with what we have. We need to look further out as well. Ask those systems to how we fight collectively. When I talk about we, I talk about allies, partners and friends now, Secretary of Defense has been beat up over integrated deterrence. I'm a believer in it. I'm not sure what it is, but that's okay because I think there's great value in talking about how we can partner with like-minded liberal democracies to counter a threat that's common to us all, that all of us bring various tools. The software piece of this is absolutely critical. It's built in the context of how we fight collectively. I mean, it's going to be different than it was in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it's going to be the same. Iraq and Afghanistan, the successes there, was based on this ability to delegate authorities down to the squad level and have them operate without direct oversight of exactly what they were doing day to day in the field. Broad oversight of objectives and effects that they're supposed to create over a two-week period, software can speed that up. It can eliminate those things that are not worth dealing with, giving us critical insights of what to focus on. And it can say, these areas have the highest level of return. This will be in a symmetric fight. I think Matt mentioned this. One of our greatest challenges is logistics. We have a huge exposed logistics train to support a fight in the Western Pacific. PRCs, logistic lines, they're all internal lines. And they're all very short, very difficult to get after them. This is really about leveraging software to optimize the systems that we have now and inform the acquisition process for the systems that we should be pursuing in the near-term as well as the future. So Kerry, you've got to work with some of these sort of nascent systems as they were coming online. Can you describe a little bit about how you've brought some of those things to bear and where you think some progress is coming along that's going to help us with this? So I want to hit that, but I've got to go off the terms. Yeah, please. Question two is, I think of it in terms of what are our competitive advantages and how do we play to those while minimizing our vulnerabilities. And so I would maybe offer three thoughts on that. One is, we still have exquisite capabilities. I know they're expensive and they take a long time to build, but I want to keep Beijing second-guessing on what we can really do. And we have some pretty phenomenal capabilities up there. I think the challenge going forward now is trying to figure out that mix between the really exquisite expensive and some of these newer kind of mass volume expendable capabilities. But then also, how do you integrate both together? And then the second piece for me is, is it's the adaptability as the innovation piece. Back in 2018, that National Defense Strategy, there's a line in there that says success no longer goes to the country that develops a new technology first, but rather to the one that better integrates it and adapts its way to fighting. So whether it's your existing toolkit that you're just using differently or putting new things out into the field quicker, it's a mix of the technology and then the con-ops piece. And then the allies and partners piece that Scott mentioned, they are expanding their capability. I was just in Japan last month. I mean, there was a phenomenal, well, opportunity right now is they are on the space front. They're talking about space and security in the same sentence, which they hadn't done prior. They're increasing their defense spending. They're emphasizing counter-strike weapons. I mean, this is a very different kind of Japan policy strategy than we've seen previously. And it's being driven by China, by North Korea, by what they're seeing Russia due to Ukraine. So there's a great opportunity with the allies and partners. On the kind of what I saw, and first I have to say, I mean, I was the first person sitting in the e-ring. I mean, it was the team. It was Jack Shanahan, Drew Kukur, others that did Project Maven, and their team that they get all the credit for it. But what I really liked, and I'll use that as a particular example, and I know Pell and Tear was heavily involved in that, was they started with a problem. Like, what is just a burying your behind that you really need to solve that's consuming just manual labor hours? And the problem that they started with was full-motion video, these young men and women stare in 24, seven video screens and manually classifying what was in the screen. I mean, God, what a perfect thing for machines to do. So starting with that operational problem, and then going out and seeing kind of who can best solve this problem, and not going and picking one, but setting up these six month sprints, bringing in a variety of companies, kind of letting free market and free competition play out, and the best ones that can actually deliver a beta product that we can get out of the field, that's going to play. Which we couldn't have predicted from the get go. But the last thing I'll say on that too, what really struck me is, it was less about the code. I mean, what, 5% of the problem with Department adopting AI, it's not the algorithms, it's the front end, it's getting access to the data, cleaning it, training it, figuring out how you bring in unclassified folks to train on classified data sets. It's the security piece of it, and then it's the back end is once you've got it in place, how do you integrate it in your weapon systems, and your workflows? I mean, even the... That functions. Yeah, I mean, it was still a sidecar for a long time, because they culturally just couldn't get it integrated in the workflow, but that's where it's really going to pay off. Yeah. So, Oriana, Kiri brought up Japan's innovations, and I maybe wanted to touch real quick. What does that doing to Beijing's calculus as Japan makes really very significant moves? What is that play...how does that play out in their minds? What does this look like for them? Well, I think if you look at sort of the Chinese military calculus beyond the Taiwan problem, they are much, much less confident and rightfully so in their military capabilities at any other contingency. They can't really project power effectively against the United States and the South China Sea, one given that they start, you know, the farther they move away from mainland China, the more they have some of the same vulnerabilities when it comes to logistics, reliance on space access and things that we do. So, I think it's not that military capabilities predicts everything. That's why I look a lot at Chinese behavior discourse as well, but it can tell you a lot. We didn't have an issue in the South China Sea with the Chinese military before 2009 or so, because they couldn't really operate there before. So, when I was in China, they loved to say, well, we've never used force against Taiwan before. It's been, you know, 75 years and we've just been hanging out over here and I'm like, well, you never could before. Can we all sort of admit that? So, if you get into, like, what Japan is doing, I think we are definitely in a very stable deterrent scenario when it comes to China and Japan, for example. The Japanese, I was there meeting with their leadership a couple months ago, are very concerned about a Chinese attack on the Tsingkaku's, trying to take Okinawa. I personally, you know, the Tsingkaku's, if China takes Taiwan, the Tsingkaku's are gone. I mean, China's 100 percent going to take the Tsingkaku's. But for the rest of Japan, I am not concerned. I mean, I've never heard or read or anything about the Chinese deciding that, you know, they think that they really are going to take Okinawa. But it is youthful that they have these concerns because it is making them invest much more in their military capabilities to defend themselves. And this is indirectly useful. For one, the United States can focus more on some of the contingencies we need to focus on and rely more on our Japanese partners. Two, there is no doubt in my mind that if we do get into a state of conflict with China, the Chinese hit our bases in Japan. 100 percent Japan is in. And even if they don't do that, if there's a conflict between China and the United States, 100 percent Japan is going to let us use our assets in Japan. So those are, that's the good news story. But the slightly less good news story is that what Japan is doing is all about the defensive Japan. They are not interested in defending Taiwan. That seems like a nuanced point. And it might not come out in a lot of the statements because they'll be like, we're all behind you, United States. And you're like, what do you mean? And they're like, well, of course, when China attacks Taiwan, they will at the same time attack this in Okinawa. And so then that will trigger our involvement. And I'm like, there is no way that China is going to do that. So then I sort of qualify. And I'm like, so if they only attack Taiwan and they don't attack this in Kakao's, well, you know, then Taiwan's on its own. So I kind of am concerned about some of those scenarios. But all else being equal, having the Japanese improve their capabilities, same with the Australians, the more integration between our militaries, and going to what Admiral Swift said, this is not just military focused. But the Chinese care first and foremost about economics. The reason I don't talk about economics is because I feel like it's very hard, even if a president have control over everything, like what'd be great for the United States to be the dominant economic power in Asia? Yes, do I know how to do that? No, so I kind of stay in my lane. But the Chinese are number one trading partners or US allies and partners. Europeans. If the Europeans would just put some costs on the Chinese for their relationship with Russia, for all the stuff they're doing, China wouldn't do it. The problem is we have a collective action problem in the economic realm that's making that difficult. But you know, it is good. The Chinese are paying attention. They see our allies and partners getting on board. When I was in Beijing, I asked, why do you think this is the case? Hint, I think it has to do with your lack of restraint. But they're like, no, it's because of the United States. You force them to do these things. And so then I say, you know, we tried to force the South Koreans and the Japanese to meet and coordinate for decades. Why do you think we are so successful now? And we weren't successful in our hegemonic policies before. You know, you kind of have to use their language and go with it. And then they're like, oh, I don't know about that. But it does show that China is creating an international environment that makes it maybe more difficult for us in some ways, but increases the value of the United States as a partner. So maybe real quick, what do you suspect that they view as being our vulnerability? And Adam will sort of talk a little bit about the sheer logistical train that this looks like. There is these seams between the US and its allies that could be played upon. So those are two of them. Are there other vulnerabilities that they see from us that we should be having in mind and the kinds of things that if we demonstrate the ability to shore up those vulnerabilities, presumably it adds to deterrence. Is there anything on that you can think of? And I kind of open up that to anyone. The American people. Absolutely. Is the number one vulnerability they see. They'll be like, the Chinese people, we can sure cool, we can eat our bitterness all day long. You guys are going to last five minutes. And what I try to explain also to try to enhance deterrence, but what I think is true is in a war over Taiwan, if the United States does successfully engage in a timely manner, and then the Chinese kill Americans. Like this isn't about Taiwan anymore. And the American people resolve about stuff, you know, changes depending on the scenario. But I think it's that combination of US resolve, democratic, and this goes to the geography. It's not only that it takes us a long time to get there. It takes a long time for our decisions to make it for our leaders to make decisions. So they think they can confuse, to delay the decision making calculus so that once we start deploying forces, and then we're really slow to get there, and then all of our allies and partners value for the most part economic engagement over security. Some of them are coming around to the security side, but most of them, you know, have these strategic partnerships with China, which they've signed saying we won't let the politics get in the way. They all have a policy that Taiwan is a part of China. Very different than Ukraine, because even Japan will say some of their laws of defense don't apply to Taiwan because Taiwan is not a country. You combine all of that, and they basically think they've got some political wedges with their allies and partners. They've got the military superiority in terms of a quick conflict, and then in a protracted war as the American people. So I'm going to ask you all to kind of give some of your last thoughts before we turn it over to questions. But I wanted to maybe sum up a little bit here. We've got primarily a political deterrence issue that we're talking about, not necessarily a military one, right? So when we find ourselves in a position where we're having to deter, we're really deterring a political decision, and that encompasses all of the sort of the national security power or all the national power on either side and that calculus going in. That fundamentally, if Chinese leaders decide that they feel they have to do this, they will have already made decisions about that they feel that they are in a good enough position militarily. So maybe I kind of open up to some last thoughts that you'd have to share with the audience before we go to questions. So maybe carry out good to you first. Any last things you'd like to sort of communicate to folks? So this may be more of a question than what Orianna gets to as she can tackle it as well as you know, I'm struggling right now because the trend lines for China in terms of the military capability are all going up. The four structures, you know, more exercises, you know, air maritime incursions, you know, building more infrastructure, you know, kind of R&D infrastructure in country. So they now have this sustainment challenge. We've got to sustain this increasing military growth. At the same point in time, the economic and domestic headwinds that they're experiencing right now are tremendous. So are they going to continue to prioritize this military growth? Or are we going to see that dial down in some respects? I think that's an open question. But then in terms of conflict, is that going to curb their appetite on potential, you know, conflict scenarios in the near term? Or, you know, if they look things going kind of downhill in country, I'm going to divert and I'm going to do something before it starts to deteriorate too much. So that worries me. You know, on the technology front, I would say I would like us to elevate our discussion on technology to a more strategic level. And you obviously, you know, clearly technology support mission. But when I think about kind of the broader stage here is the diffusion of technology, the US isn't the only ones anymore, whether it's an AI computer, whatever that has, you know, this kind of advanced capability. You know, many of these commercial companies are going to third parties and trying to sell it and they're up against Chinese and other competitors. So it's not a sure thing that our companies will be able to win and be successful there. We still want to be the partner of choice in our technology. We still, you know, we want to have a robust industrial and innovation base and that can't just be funded by taxpayer dollars. So, you know, we need to have that broader app to clearly protect technology, make sure it doesn't go to China. But at the same point in time, I think we need to open it up and we need to take a hard look at our export policies because this is just a different era and set of conditions than we had 40 years ago when we first created things like Eitar. Absolutely. It's got. Yeah, so quickly, I want to go back to stress that it really is the will of the people. I mean, that's what we should be most concerned about. I look at how critical software is. Cyber gets top billing. Interesting to me, not fascinating. I think cyber is a vector to get after software. I look at colonial pipelines. So think about it if China moved on Taiwan and their first action with counter the United States was to shut down gas flow from fuel pumps all up and down, just up and down the East Coast. We had Russian hackers that did that. Where would the will of the American people be at that point before any American lies were lost to say, why is Taiwan so important to me? I can't get enough gas into my car to get home from work or to get to work. So we need to broaden our thinking about what the challenge is. I'm an optimist. I don't believe in 2027 because it could happen tomorrow and we need to have a sense of urgency. It's what does tomorrow look like if that turns out to be reality. Allies and partners are stepping up and doing an incredible job. Japan is deterring China. Period. Taiwan is deterring China because of the things it's doing but very limited. Australia is doing the same. Germany is back in the Western Pacific in a meaningful way. They've got issues with the EU and some limits as to what they can do. But they are back sending messages. Queen Elizabeth deployment from Great Britain into the Pacific. These are military actions but with them there's a strong diplomatic piece behind this to say we are supporting the international rules-based order and the Pacific is the free and open Pacific. The power of that statement is it came from Prime Minister Abe. It didn't come from the United States. So I'm optimistic but I still got fire insurance on my house. We need a sense of urgency about this and we need to take a broader look at it than just the military piece. And we're stressed on the military side and not diminishing that like it's a siam dunk and they're strong deterrents there. The last thing I'll say is we have to do a full assessment of the actions that we're taking that we think are deterrent. Are they deterrent in the minds of the PRC and on the flip coin are they reassuring to our allies and partners? There's a lot of things that we do in the name of deterring the PRC that our allies and partners would rather not have us do. We need to do an assessment of that impact because are they as willing to support us if we're taking these actions that are counter to their own national interest? We can complicate it like I said. All right, Ori, I'm going to go to you but folks in the audience get your questions ready? So last thoughts before we turn to questions, Andrew? So I mean the thing about the sense of urgency I have to say that I've been working on China for a long time and I know we talk about China a lot but when you actually look at what's being done it can be extremely frustrating. I mean I can't tell you obviously I'm here in my civilian capacity and only you know I do not speak on behalf of the Department of Defense or the Department of the Air Force but 14 years working in China in uniform. I can't tell you how many times I'm like this is an idea I have and they're like great great great well we'll have it ready in 20 years. I recently had this conversation about certain planning in which I was like okay I think we need to put together this different plan and they're like oh major you know what do you know about life? You know how long it takes to put that together and I was like I don't how long and they're like about 18 months of the whole planning cycle. They said okay what if China does this tomorrow how long would it take for you to put together the plan? Three days. Well then just do it in three days right? So the frustration of the sense of urgency is really there and part of this is cultural. Part of it has to do with I know we talk about software and it's very sexy and like weapon systems and equipment but it's someone in the system I mean the first place I want to see this is in the personnel system and some of the largest costs for the Department of Defense where all of our money is going is on like personnel issues you know on how we deal with veterans how we deal with education how we deal with child care. You know I am taking over command of a new unit the Pentagon which I'm supposed to come up with ideas of how to reassess all these policies and it is it is hard and so the bottom line is yes technology is really important but given what said here it's also the quality of our people or quality of the people and recruiting retaining and training the best people to get at these problems that's what we need and so we need some new arrangements to help people who are really good at technology to be spending more time getting at these problems to help people who know a lot about China overcome some of the security barriers so they can help the US government in these ways and so I also hope that to see some you know besides obviously the technological innovation which is very important the organizational innovation that might be necessary for us to succeed in this area. Very good. All right first question who's going to be who's going to be up first sir right here. I have a question for you Dr. Mastro you mentioned at the beginning that the PRC would think about another alternative to war you think is that strategy that they may want to break society in Taiwan so you will just implode and take over. So it seems that a lot of people in China are very confident that economics is more important than political freedom. There's a lot of reasons for this but whenever they evaluate like the issues in Hong Kong won't have you they're like you know if we could just solve the housing crisis in Hong Kong we wouldn't have these political problems in Hong Kong. In their mind when people have the choice they will choose economics over politics. Now from the American perspective that's hard for us to understand like we look at the progression of how things are going in Taiwan and it's hard to envision that the people of Taiwan decide that they want to be under the PRC without any sort of threat of kinetic action right. So when I think that like peaceful reunification is impossible that's why I think that very really do populations decide to give up those freedoms once I have it. From China's perspective like you know they really think that if given the chance they could sell this you know and they'll often bring up for example like why if it's not true why are they so afraid to talk to us. If you think it's impossible for us to convince them through negotiations then why are they refusing to even meet with us. So on one hand to this reassurance component it is useful for us for China to still have faith that they can achieve their goals with Taiwan without using force. I don't think they can but as long as they are confident in the power of their system and persuasion they think they're going to be so great that like everyone's going to be you know want to be a part of that party and they think the only thing standing in the way is that the United States is encouraging the DPP and Taiwan you know we're the ones causing the people of Taiwan not to want this right. The trends show actually the opposite that the less people have confidence in the United States the more they identify with being Taiwanese versus Chinese but the thing you know I like to say in Chinese language there's only two words that I know of that are directly translated from English because there's no conception of them in the Chinese culture and one of them is logic so like as long as they remain convinced of those things I think it's better for us. Yeah but I share your concern that that that that that them being convinced of that is beginning to break down that they are seeing many of those things in which it would appear that the Taiwanese people have made their own decisions and that that that is that sinks in that'll be very difficult and create real problems. If I get to say that a quick thing which is I identified that before that they are losing confidence in peace or unification but it wasn't until this visit that I realized that they think the reason peaceful reunification won't happen is us. I just thought it's because like I mean of course it won't work who wants to be a part of China but they think it's because of us. Next question. Alright come on folks so we've solved everything. I know that's not true. Sir. Mark Adams from Pereton. I have is more about us and less about China. I have two kids that are in their 20s and early 30s and most of us live through the Cold War, Cold Wars whether you want to call it one or two it was continuation and we all were pretty well convinced that to be on board with the whole idea that we needed a peaceful strength right Ronald Reagan my favorite president of all time but I don't think that our younger generation is quite on board. I'm quite frankly and I think that my question to leaders like yourself is what do we need to do to help our younger generations understand the dire state of what this could mean to their future to their kids' future to the future of our republic and also convince them that there are alternatives but that peace through strength is actually part of that deterrence. So that's just my again and those are sort of my thoughts but I'd love to hear what this group has say. So anyone want to take that one start with? I'll jump on it. I think Oriana may have mentioned it maybe it was Carrie but I think your comments are reflected in the challenge that the military has with recruiting right now and so I would turn that around. How do we I think what your question was how do we help young people this nation understand how dire this is? I want to understand what they think about the situation and what is the situation is it just Taiwan that's why I say it's not it's not about Taiwan it's about the international rules based order. So if the international rules based order gets flipped and international rules based order it broadly is about discourse and dialogue to resolve differences as opposed to force and coercion. I think there's some strands that could be pulled with COVID and what the PRC response was to COVID both when they shut the nation down and then when they rapidly opened up both of them had huge consequences both of those were made from a nationalistic political position. So if that's what your vision of the system that governs the world of the future then you should be careful. I think how we tell the story to young people is really important. We need to be talking about this in universities we need to be talking about it throughout academia we need to be talking about it in the military but unfortunately our discussion internal to the United States at least is so polarized on this dimensions it's very difficult to have these conversations within our families much less within our society. This goes back to I think the thing all three of us agree and our greatest vulnerability is national will and I don't know what the answer is to your question other than then do acknowledge it that that is the primary question to ask it's going to be too late if the bubble goes up and if attack happens on Taiwan it would be too late that Japanese people have the same Japanese government has the same problem with its people. Korea has the same problem Australia has the same problem why is this so important to me we have to be able to answer that question. Yeah I mean I this is ultimately a fight for the what world we want to live in it is it's our values it's the international order and yeah I've got young kids myself and I don't know how to get the message through I don't know how to really communicate that I mean a world order run by China's approach and they're kind of system of governments is a hundred and eighty degrees from how we approach things in terms of you know repression of of you know freedoms individual rights expression justice surveillance about 400 plus million surveillance cameras all over social scores if you're a minority forget it you're going to some internment camp I mean I just don't think that they fully understand really what we've lived in such a a period of freedom and relative peace that they just don't understand what that alternative could look like maybe we need a tick-tock video to explain it and put on tick-tock I would say at Stanford I teach this intro to the international security course right so I have all these 18 year olds and we do this simulation before Ukraine it was basically what happened with Ukraine it was like a country country be exact same scenario and part of the scenario you ask the students like what are you going to do this other country has invaded your church or what are you going to do and they're like I'm going to condemn them on Twitter and then their social image will be you know and I'm like they're like still invading you like are you going to move any forces and they're like maybe it was a misunderstanding and we should just see like if they're okay while they're invading us I'm like what is going on you know so on one hand you know I understand that that kind of frustration and the other when I hear senior military leaders talk about some of the difficulties with like recruiting retaining I do think that a lot of our organizations are outdated and completely have failed to adopt you know the military still 99% is like situated for 1950s lifestyle in which like a man is the military member and they're followed around by their wives you know the fact that like women have to like fight to be able to have like breast pumps on military bases is absurd so I get the senior leaders always like toughen up this is about international ordering everything the other hand like when you know I went through two pregnancies in uniform is really frustrating that you don't have the support that you need and so I know of all sorts of people who are committed to the country that want to stay in but just like can't make it work so I think there has to be a balance and and of course telling people how important it is you know good relations with China the way I think about it is you know I I like going to China the world is a better place because our countries are interacting with each other if we fight a war besides the fact that it will be brutal after that war we will have no interaction between our two nations for the rest of my lifetime if not lifetimes to come and that is a fundamentally just sadder world for my children to grow up and then the one we currently do but I think there has to be a give and take among the generations like while while there has to be a greater sense of maybe purpose and responsibility put on the younger generations there also has to be a greater sense of adaptability that you know we live in a different age and and they have different expectations of what they want to do with their lives and how they want to live their lives and we need to be able to to adapt to that well I would like to have all of you give a round of applause to our our three panelists with a real treat thank you so much
