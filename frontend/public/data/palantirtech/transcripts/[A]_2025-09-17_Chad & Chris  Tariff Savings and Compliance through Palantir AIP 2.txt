TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

[Music] Hi, I'm Chad. I'm an architect at 
Palanteer. Today we've got Christopher who leads some of our manufacturing work. Thanks 
for joining me. Thank you, Chad. So, I know we were going to talk about a lot of different stuff 
today. One of them being bombs or bill materials. Pretty central to manufacturing and kind of 
the trade compliance and how do I make sure I'm following all the rules and regulations with trade 
across the globe, especially as things are rapidly changing right now. how do we how do we manage 
through that? So maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're doing in that space. So a lot 
of when you think about uh bills of materials or bombs and how you you frame that um we're really 
focused on taking actually what goes into the three sort of like silos of the business. So in 
engineering data you have all of your bills and materials you may have in that PLM system drawings 
or other information that can tell you what you're actually building. But then you often like cross 
reference that with another system such as an ERP. This is where you're actually seeing what's going 
into the products. What's my customer orders that then in the trade compliance world also kind of 
like starts to look at um what are the HTS codes and how how do they apply to those products. So 
typically those teams are super super siloed. So when you try to do different use cases, you're not 
necessarily getting the benefits. But via the AIP platform and using the ontology, we're bridging 
the gaps in those worlds. And that's what's leading us to a lot of different workflows. Very 
cool. So yeah, bringing the data together between the kind of the contextual engineering specs and 
components that are in a lot of different places and the actual context of transactions in real 
world combining that to understand like where is their opportunity. So it's very cool. I I so 
I'd love to just actually see what you're talking about here because I think it makes more real when 
we talk about bomb. It's very kind of opaque idea. But why don't we just take a look? Awesome. So 
if we look at the screen over here, this is Onyx, which is our notional medical manufacturer and 
distributor. So they have some different bills and materials of some assemblies that they're 
building. They build different syringes, which might be available, and they also build more 
complex uh products such as T99 ventilators. When we actually go into this ventilator, we can 
see here via the ontology that we've pulled up all the subcomponents that that are coming 
in. And through that combination of ERP data, uh, country of origin data from trade compliance 
and engineering data, we can actually come here and see, okay, what are the annual volumes 
on these components? Which countries are they coming from? What's our spend? And so all this 
together is because we have the ontology that's bridging the gaps between these systems. So we 
can have one view of all this data. We can also actually look more on like a hierarchal level 
of like what's actually happening. So here we took that ventilator assembly and we can take the 
top level components we can see like what are the mid assemblies and then what's happening at the 
bottom. And so again where that uh ontology really comes into play is if we zoom in on a specific 
component and we kind of like look around we can see all the different objects which might 
be related to that in the ontology. So a bomb component is going to have its parents. It's going 
to have any recommendations on what might be the materials. You're going to have some drawings 
other metadata or maybe even the supplier. So if we look at something such as a drawing, 
we then start to bring that out into our view and you can imagine that we're going across many 
many different systems which are typically siloed. Yeah, that's neat. So, so really the ontology 
is mapping out the not just like here's what in a bomb, but actually the hierarchy, how they fit 
together, the materials, suppliers, everything. It's like it's the data, the logic, the action 
that makes up how I actually produce a product. Exactly. And while this looks super simple, a lot 
of companies have multiple PLM systems, which is where the engineering data comes from. Maybe 
even multiple ERPs cuz perhaps they like grew by acquisition. They might have different types 
of components that way. And just bridging beh and some of it's very unstructured data too cuz we 
get into the engineering side. Sometimes it's the the drawings of it uh of an actual subcomponent 
and the materials and like it's not always nicely in a in rows and columns. So sometimes this 
is very unstructured m or like mixed with very structured data from like ERPs and that that's 
where I think really a lot of the complexity comes in is is bringing all of that unstructured 
and structured data to get the real view of what's going on. Exactly. And then typically where 
customers like get started is they're attempting to go into in into these drawings and like writing 
down different elements and it just it's it it's super super complex for them. Yes. So looking 
into like some of these bills of materials, this like actually then starts to bring a 
lot of workflows to the forefront from a found foundry and AIP perspective. So you might 
be using these to do something for let's say obsolescence management throughout your bills of 
materials. So let's say you have a a company and these guys are switching um in their ventilator 
assembly, they're switching the PCB supplier from one co company to another. So if you actually 
think about that, you need to be able to say, okay, from an engineering perspective, I validated 
this and I'm going to swap my PCBs, but then when I have different plants, um it's like, are those 
plants actually on that revision of the bomb right now in their ERP system? And then when's the right 
point to do a cut over, right? Because if let's say you decide to cut over the product and start 
using the other one, the other the other elements that are left over might need to be scrapped 
because it's no longer in your as per like your customer specifications, right? So that's one 
point where you can actually capture a lot of value from this type of workflow. Yeah, especially 
in the manufacturer space. Like I always love to see customers starting at the bomb because you can 
get to cost of goods sold, engineering standards, engineering change over, you know, inventory 
levels, procurement, like it really is the center of of the business that is so powerful 
and unlocking use cases like this. Exactly. Even even sales when you think about it, right? 
Because if when you're quoting a new project, what did it cost before? What was the impact? How 
do I try to pass that along? Right. Exactly. So, what we're going to look at now is actually how we 
can use this in a different realm which is more so around trade compliance. So, there's been a lot 
of different changing regulations towards trade lately. Um, we have tariffs that are coming in 
for different reasons such as steel and aluminum tariffs, IPA, etc. And so, we really want to 
see how can we use this data in the platform to make sure we're compliant. And then through 
compliance, we can actually reduce our exposure to the terrorists themselves. Yeah. So what you're 
saying really is it's not only just that like, hey, these things are changing, but it the bombs 
can be so complex and subasssemblies and you know, how much aluminum does that PCB board have on 
it or whatever those things are that it's not that like I'm trying to skirt anything. It's 
actually coming back to like how do I make sure I'm compliant and not overpaying, I'm not 
underpaying, that I'm doing the right thing, I think is really what this comes back to. 
Exactly. It's completely about doing the right thing because if you actually see how some 
of these uh HTS codes are structured which flag for these you do have material specific ones that 
yes this comp this component is made out of steel or it's made out of aluminum. You then also have 
functional ones. So this is a propeller blade and a propeller blade is going to flag potentially 
for a steel tariff, right? But if you're an engineering company and you use different types 
of materials etc. Maybe your propeller blades are made out of plastic. And so the only way you're 
going to know that is being able to actually go through here to either make sure that you're 
being assessed on the correct content of steel and aluminum in that item. Yeah. Okay. That's Yeah. 
That adds another layer of complexity to that cube of trying to figure out like what am I supposed 
to, you know, do for this compliance uh is very complex. Exactly. Right. And then what you're 
typically going to see is that customers don't even know where to start. So maybe they have tens 
of thousands of parts in their like subasssemblies and components in their part catalog and maybe 
they want to start on like okay maybe this was the one I imported last month but that's not 
necessarily forward looking either right so that's where that ERP data is really important because 
you can then start to get this intersection of um where what are the parts that I'm going to be 
importing the most of based off of my forecast etc in the next few months and then how do I then 
go through the bills and materials of those and prioritize is which ones do we need to update our 
documentation to make sure that we're compliant and reduce our overall exposure. Awesome. Yeah. 
So, let's see how we do that. All right. Perfect. So, if we look at the screen, imagining I am 
a trade compliance uh manager in the Sterling Heights uh department. I'm looking through here 
at some different proposals that have coming out from the AIP system and they're making different 
recommendations to ensure that I have the optimal uh trade compliance amongst my components. So, 
there could be a recommendation that's coming through because I historically put all of my 
RFQS into the AIP system and it realizes that I'm getting uh hit with a tariff on a component 
that was actually cheaper from a vendor in the United States who originally bid on the project. 
So that's a type of recommendation saying, "Hey, maybe we should go look at that vendor again and 
see if they could take over the volumes." But there's some other aspects of this as well. One 
of them is for USMCA certificates. So here we can see a different part number that's being flagged 
saying that we had a USMCA certificate in 2023, we had one in 2024 and we should reach out to get 
the one for 2025 to ensure compliance. Um, these are yearly renewals, so you really need to be on 
top of that in order to capture all the value. The other more kind of like interesting one is 
that we see some flags for some components that potentially have no steel or aluminum content 
in them or partials. And so because this has now been flagged by the system, we're going to 
look a little bit further into what we can do um to assess this. So moving to the next screen, 
um we have now my action queue where the AI has queued up different actions for me to look at. 
I'm going to focus on specifically the section 232 content analysis. And I can see I have two 
potential assembly parts that I'm bringing in um that are being hit with steel and aluminum tariffs 
and the system is actually recommending to me that they may not actually have steel and aluminum or 
maybe partial. So how that kind of like works is we go through these different steps. So there's 
a component flag for section 232 from the live broker data. We then have different components 
that are analyzed in that bill of materials and then the entire assembly is being analyzed by 
AIP. So, we see here this enclosure. Um, it's an enclosure that's coming in from Mexico. The annual 
volume is 100,000 units. We're spending 410,000. All from the ERP data. We know this. And then we 
have a potential tariff impact of $100,000 that's coming through. Um, but when we actually look 
here, AIP has flagged this as having no steel and no aluminum content. So, that gives us the ability 
to start to then go to the subcomponents in this bill of materials. We have some parts drawing 
from our engineering data. And we can start to see here, okay, this is a plastic feet standoff, 
different card slot brackets. Um, if we want to, we can pull up the spec sheet as well to see this 
is actually a text spec sheet for for a polymer. So that makes sense. And then we have the ability 
to accept or reject these recommendations. Uh, typically when we look into something like 
this with trade compliance, you do want to have a human in the loop who's making this final 
decision right before you you file these. Um, so the importance here is that AI is being used 
to prioritize these based off of impact. Kind of like the 8020 rule of saying 20% of the parts are 
going to have most impact. Um, and then you have your trade compliance team actually do the final 
assessment and collect any documentation they need in the platform to actually go take action on 
these. Yeah. Cuz the inverse of this when you don't have this is you're opening up specs, going 
through PLM's, emails, spreadsheets, trying to find all the complex subasssemblies verse here's 
the one that we think has the most impact and all the information about it. We think this is 
the right call. Yes or no? I think that's like a distinct difference of the before and after. 
Right. Oh, exactly. You could be spending like one day just trying to analyze these parts if you're 
just looking at the drawings and trying to move through that on your own. So, I mean this is cool. 
Like this is a notional example. This makes a lot of sense from like this plastic. I have aluminum 
tariffs and I want to go through and as your bombs get very many levels deep and they're super 
complex with thousands of items. It's hard to track. Like how are customers doing this? I guess 
this is inspired from customers. Yeah. So a lot of customers are actually doing very similar work to 
this. And it's funny where they typically start is um I'm just going to pull up all my PLM systems 
and go into spreadsheets and just attempt to do this. And you see it taking like days to even 
just process one part, right? Wow. Um Yeah. And that's got to be hard because if it takes you a 
day as things are constantly changing and moving, knowing that kind of impact can be very hard. 
So every time something changes, you have to kind of reassess those impacts. And I think that's 
that's really the power of AIP here. Exactly. And even just in the ontology of storing these parts 
because you could be assessing the same components and the same assemblies over and over and over and 
you wouldn't know that if you're just working in spreadsheets. Oh wow. Oh yeah. Cuz the the sub 
assembly that goes to multiple different parts, you could be reassessing all of those as you 
go down the tree could be very difficult. Interesting. Exactly. Yeah. So, so from an impact 
standpoint, like you know, doing this at scale, it's not only just the the human component of 
like I'm not spending a day doing each one, but it's the I'm in compliance, not getting fined, and 
two, I'm saving money because I'm in compliance, I'm not overpaying. So, I think there's like 
three big wins there. Not only beyond just the kind of the the human piece of it. Exactly. 
Right. It's being in compliance so that you don't have to pay these anymore. and then also 
actually going back and saying now that you have all your documentation together in one in one 
place can I go back and recover these right so there's actually potential on both sides very cool 
if we take a look further actually just wanted to zoom into a specific example here so more complex 
than a component that may not actually have steel aluminum in it but was flagged is when you have 
partial steel and aluminum content so in this case it's another type of uh enclosure that's coming 
in from Mexico and It has a a lower tariff impact, which is why it's kind of like below the other one 
on the list. It's flagging as no aluminum content, but it's flagging as it does have steel content. 
And the reasoning from the model is that there are these three specific components in it that 
are explicitly described as steel, right? Um, so when we go through here, we actually see, yeah, 
there's a lot of different plastic housings. There might be a washer that is made out of nylon, 
but there is a steel screw. We may have some different information that goes through such as 
like a drawing where hey this actually if we zoom in here in this little block we can see that it's 
stainless steel. And so the key is is that we need to be able to process through all of these very um 
quickly and efficiently to even know this in the first place so we can bring this up to our teams 
to accept what we're looking at. And that's where uh AIP logic is really coming into play. So that 
way we can have an AI agent which is doing a lot of this pre-processing to make sure that our 
trade compliance teams are just focusing on the real impactful work of actually putting the 
package together and closing these out. Very cool. So you said AIP logic. What is that? So AIP 
logic is one of the tools in the AIP platform that allows us to orchestrate LLMs to be able to work 
throughout the ontology. So I'm actually going to pull one of those up right now. So this is 
the tool we're looking at. Um, and this is where we're starting to design how we're going 
to have our AI agent, which is moving through these bills of materials. I'm going to open up 
a uh test case for us so that way we can see um exactly like what we're looking at. And so 
I'm going to run this on one of the components as an example and then walk you through exactly 
what we're seeing. So the first thing that we do is we start at our bill of material component in 
our ontology and we use the linkage between that and the part drawing to go see do I have any part 
drawings? Do I have any other documentation that might be in my system that's linked to this 
component. After I do that as an assessment I say actually I do have a drawing. I'm able to 
pull one model ahead to actually take a look at this and to see u what it thinks. So in this case 
we have a prompt which is going to our model and it's saying you're an expert in interpreting part 
specifications sheets and mechanical drawings. So given this image of it um can you extract and 
list out all the materials for this part and pay special attention to steel and aluminum and 
you could easily modify this to include copper etc in the future. And so what's happening if we 
actually track this through in this panel here, uh, if we open up that step that's equivalent, we 
can see, okay, here's where the model went to that drawing we just looked at earlier and it's pulling 
out stainless steel. Yeah, I think important point you're bringing up here because like we're now 
talking about LM's reasoning, doing retrieval, augmented generation across the ontology, but 
also multimodal like we store multimodal data in the ontology to to represent how this is really 
happening. But that becomes very important on the on the agentic side is now these agents are 
accessing via either vector store in the ontology for semantic search to find things or they're 
going and looking at the images that are stored as part of this so that one semantic object can 
have this rich representation across all of those different media types. And like this is a great 
example why that's important when you're doing the agentic flows is now it can also reason 
across the different medias that we have too. Exactly. Yeah. And what's even more 
interesting about that too is that it leads to even more use cases. So here's something 
we're looking at materials for trade compliance, but a lot of customers actually do workflows 
where they do material harmonization where they're kind of looking between um all of my 
drawings in my engineering database to say, could I be buying the same part under different 
part numbers in different areas? Right. And so that's like using the next use case that you build 
on top of it to get even more value. Yeah. Yeah, and I think that's the power of the ontology is 
really the high level reuse, the malleability to your use cases. Um, but you know, injecting that 
extra layer of things on top of it. It's like, no, I already have the ontology 90% there. I just 
need some more objects. Let me go build that. Um, think about it differently. And I think that's 
where also then um these agentic workflows come in as well is now I can start to string those 
together across business processes to automate more and more of a business. Exactly. And some 
businesses may say, "Actually, I don't exactly have the drawings readily available." But that's 
okay, too, because that's where you can start to use more of the reasoning parts. So, we actually 
take this information and give it to a second uh model a little bit later. And if there's any 
drawing information available, we tell it to take that into account. But it can also use things such 
as part descriptions, some understanding if you give it maybe the HTS description so that it can 
kind of like do its best guess in the absence of some of that other data to at least help you do 
that prioritization workflow. So in this case, um, we have a second model which is now assessing 
based off of the description of the part, the part number, and anything it was able to get out the 
drawing. Does it contain steel or aluminum? Yes. No. Right? And then at that point that's what's 
then given back to this action in the ontology. And then we're able to actually write this back 
against the specific um component in that bill of materials which is what was showing up in our 
application. Yeah. So the other thing I noticed here is you're using multiple different models in 
one agent that flow too. So I saw Gemini 2 flash uh for the kind of image extraction piece and 
then now I've got GPD40 for reasoning pieces. Uh I think that's pretty cool from a standpoint 
is I can mix and match models for the right size, the right use case even in one agent. Exactly. 
Yeah. And I think that's like that's important. You're also showing the test components and 
evaluation like how do I evaluate this at scale? But the last part I would call out here is like 
these are actions defined in the ontologies. The ontology is the guard rails for getting access 
to data, the logic of the different components, but also the actions because I want the agent 
to take an action. And sometimes the agent says, "Hey person, you need to review this." Other 
times it's I write back to your SAP system, your PLM to make this real. And so I think that's 
the other piece here that's important is we can drive those actions on guard rails through the 
right security primitives back to source systems to make it like you know scalable across hundreds 
or thousands of these different use cases um very quickly. Now let's go back to the application and 
see the next step so that we can close this out. So going back into the application, we can look 
at where our component is and we can see we might need to collect some supplier information now 
because if it's partial steel aluminum, we may not have that in our data. And so we want to go 
to that component specific supplier to figure that out. So if we click the take action button, that's 
actually going to open up another window for us. And here we can see that there's a proposed 
supplier who's related to this component via the anttology. And then we're going to ask a model 
to actually start to generate that out for us so that we can reach out to these suppliers. It's 
put together this information. It's now going to request the steel content, the weight, the country 
of pore or smelled in the case of aluminum, etc. So that way we can get all this information 
together and we can send this out as an email to the supplier. In this case, we actually already 
got a response. So the system can actually now use another agent which is actually going to read 
through this and check, did we get the right information back? If we didn't, we can request 
further clarifications. But the other thing that we can do is accept that supplier response. That's 
going to show us that we parsed out the values that they've sent back to us. And then when we 
click submit, we can commit that to the ontology and then now put together the entire package. 
So we have all our supplier communications. We have all our drawings available. We have the 
bill of materials for the parts. Everything's logged in and auditable in terms of a package. 
And then we can see that while originally we were getting tariffed on a $36 60 um unit price 
of of a component, we've actually reduced that because only $2 of the components um constituent 
materials is actually steel and aluminum. So when you're actually now compliant with the tariff um 
it's actually reduced it by 88,000 $88,000 for the year. Oh wow. Okay. So that that's cool that now 
I'm simulating out finding solutions simulating out the impact and then can make it real like and 
understand what that impact is before I make it um all with human and AI working together. 
That's that's pretty cool. Exactly right. And it's um if you just think about the scale of the 
different systems here communicating to brokers communicating to suppliers super super difficult 
unless you have a platform like AIP. Yeah. and and it's like it's easy to understand and one off. 
It's but okay now go do this for 10,000. Um right that's that's when you really need a system like 
this to prioritize facilitate bring all the data together and everything like that. Um that's 
cool also because now I can track the impact and success of these things. So from like an ROI 
perspective for people to take on projects like this you know having a hard ROI of the you know of 
the money saved by being in compliance um that's that's pretty powerful. Exactly. And it may not 
even be with in terms of your filings. Perhaps you have customers who have more control over their 
supply chain and they might actually want to know like when you're passing on potential tariff costs 
on to them, how are you accurately passing those costs on to them, right? Oh wow. Okay. So you're 
that that facilitates the conversation when when a tariff has has forced us to increase the price 
to our customers to be able to say actually it's because of these components. Here's what that cost 
differential is to be fully transparent when you have to make those changes. Exactly. And let's 
say if you're making a sub assembly for a bigger uh equipment manufacturer, you have to make sure 
that you're properly allocating which tariff goes to which manufacturer. Otherwise, like one 
may say, how come I'm paying the tariff that is on components going to the other guy, right? 
Yep. Yep. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, cool. So, that was awesome to see kind of in 
action the flow of how things are integrated. And I love always that when we talk about AIP, 
it's not AI in your face. It's actually in the background automating really that that autonomous 
enterprise. But speaking of that, like what are you seeing across customers and like what are 
they looking for in the space? Why is this moving so quickly? Good question. So because the 
regulations are changing so quickly, um you have to be very agile in order to adapt your system 
so that you can respond to that. So, for example, some of the other tariffs, um, if you had a USMCA 
certification, you would actually be exempt from them. But the problem is a lot of companies don't 
necessarily manage their USMCA certifications correctly. They expire every year. So, you really 
need to have a helper, in this case, an AI agent, which can actually run through those and say, 
"Hey, like you're going to be importing a lot of this part number, and you had a cert last year, 
but you don't have one now. So, let's go collect it." Another case is also in terms of just um if 
you're creating new components because you're like having revised products, you may not necessarily 
be importing the same products this year that you did last year, right? And so if you then go off 
of historical lists, you're not actually going to be seeing what's ahead of you and prioritizing 
yourself correctly. Yeah. Yeah. So, and all of this is moving so quickly. like how long does it 
take customers to get spun up on something like this? So, a workflow like this um typically takes 
a couple days to get the first version set up and then they can be off and running within about a 
week, a week and a half. And that's also really important because while going forward you want 
to be compliant so you can have correct filings, you do have an opportunity to actually go back 
and correct your filings, but there's sort of like a cliff that it approaches at which point you 
can't actually correct anymore. So, the faster you get going, um, the better that you can, um, make 
sure that you're being correctly charged for your tariffs. Wow. Okay. So, being able to set this up 
in a few days to be able to start to recover these things, get in compliance, it's never too late 
to get started, I guess. And so, that that's a it's a pretty good story across a lot of what we 
do at Palanteer, but specifically in this where, hey, things are just happening. I need to adjust 
to my business. There's nothing else I can do besides move quicker and be compliant and agile 
with what's happening. And so I think that's a pretty powerful story. What's the bigger vision 
now that I have this bomb and I connected all these system? Like what other things can I do 
with that? Mhm. Well, that's a good question, Chad, because it's really interesting that once 
you've gone into your your engineering systems such as your PLMs and your ERPs, put that 
together. This is a really good uh starting point to be able to do other use cases. So, for 
example, back to the obsolescence management, that's very valuable for how do you make sure 
you're not sitting on different inventories, doing the material harmonization where you're 
analyzing across your spend potentially, am I buying the same thing in multiple places? 
And then even when we think about when we're doing RFQS for future procurement needs, um 
maybe now you can properly assess a vendor in the United States to be awarded business in the 
future because it's actually going to be cheaper. Yes, it's that it's that balance and way off. 
I think similar like cost of goods sold and understanding really there all the way to sales 
and supply chain. I think the bomb is really the center of a manufacturing company. So it's 
that that bleed off to other use cases that's so powerful. Mhm. Even think production scheduling, 
right? The only way you're going to know if you don't have components to to actually build 
that product on the line is if you can properly traverse the bill of materials and go check your 
inventories. Yes. Yes. So definitely it's cool. It's a cool motivator to start with the bomb. I 
think that leads to a lot of other use cases, but you know, it's really about how do we help people 
um move with what's important in their business right now and it's everchanging. So, thanks a lot 
Christopher for showing me this today. It's pretty uh insightful to see this work and how do we do 
these things cuz it on for surface it doesn't seem that difficult but man in the details in at scale 
this is very very hard. Exactly. Thank you Chad.
