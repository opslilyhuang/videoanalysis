TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hello everyone, it's an honor to be here today at this incredible event among so many amazing people. As title suggests, I'm here as a relevant and new customer to volunteer to share with you who we are at Integrity and why we chose to volunteer in our journey to digital transformation. A bit of a me quite honestly, I'm a pretty simple person. Two things I've adopted and I'm very proud of in Integrity. If people at Integrity and they're a drive to the dedication of each one of the years, is what drives me to push the boundaries of our data to push forward and accomplish things. I'm also a huge form of the one fan, which is why I was while catching a flight out of the Shreddera port last year, caught my eye. Palantir saw for our scudier for our to make split second seasons a split second faster. This sadly spoke to me because not only am I a fan of all the customer rooms at Integrity or decorating with front form of the one champions, but it's much more important than that. I see so many parallels with the F1 industry and the customer manufacturing that we're in. This message in the ad, deeply relates to our vision of Integrity. It's the passion and drive to seek perfection through data analytics that really inspires me. And it's sent to my director of operations, which hears me today to look into. At Integrity, we design a manufacturer custom plastic injection most of the automotive industry. We build over 500 molds a year for over 60 different customers. Our molds that we produced are including parts from front head lamps, front and rear faces, all the interior parts, and all structural components within the vehicle. The molds themselves are very complex. As you can see behind me, this upper scroll mold is made up of 300 major components that we need to manufacture in-house. In 1300 smaller components that need to be purchased and managed to road our supply chain, all these components need to be coordinated so they arrive ready for final assembly within six to 18 weeks of design completion. To add to that complexity, the molds we build each year, all varied, they're completely different each one. So the different in size, complexity, functionality, as well as customer requirements. The second tool is the facial mold made up of 294 components that need to be manufactured and in our 2000 components that need to be purchased. And finally, the last one is the bezel two shot mold that contains over 411 manufactured components and 2700 purchase components. So while we build over 500 molds per year, as you can see, we're a manufacturing approximately a hundred and seventy four thousand unique components and all of them are supply chain and fresh approximately one point two million components. Each with their own specific timeline and all are trying to meet the demanding timing and pricing pressure from our customers. Along with our very talented team, we use highly advanced five-axis CNC machines to produce our molds. Over the last 20 years, in business, a key factor in our growth has been our ability to always push limits of what these machines can do through technology. But what five years ago, we realized that we had to change the way we worked and managed our company. Well, we already established ourselves as a leader in the industry. When you were in order to sustain the position, you are more importantly, go to the next level with the work on our entire operating system. The next system is to provide better user experience for our team while providing more accurate data for analytics and decision making. We have been able to make city gains throughout the box software, BI tools, our talented health developers. We weren't seeing it progress as quickly as we wanted to. Norby Conf and our current path could take us to the game change results we were aiming to achieve. Which is why Palantir was so important to us. For me, our team, integrity team works so hard every day and what they do and the dedication they put in. I had to make sure we made a big leap forward in Palantir to team them up with a company like Palantir that could help them maximize their potential. I have to say, it's been great. At one point, if any of the process, Kevin mentioned to me that these guys will be integrity speed in four months in, they're continuing to do so. Behind me, you'll see how a foundry is able to complete the capture that complexed and rolled in the process required to produce it. Through our merging digital twin, we're able to accomplish this in 16 weeks and we'll have plans to connect all plants in all three countries within the next three years. I have to say, even though we are a small company compared to Palantir's main customers, we've never treated this way once from this communication to the custom demo they put together for us all the way to the early days of implementation. The Palantir team to help achieve our goals has been extraordinary. Knowing this, we expect this software to be impressive, but the passion the team has shown in helping us achieve our objectives have been incredible. Not to mention, they are great people with values that align with ours, which is really important to us. On top of all of this, before committing to working with them, Dr. Carb, the time to travel to our city and meet and listen about our company and also share those ideas, thank you again, Dr. Carb. It was truly appreciated and very impactful. So everything seemed to be aligning that was the right direction to make. It wasn't a decision we'd take lightly. This is a very large financial commitment for a company about our size. It's currently the largest investment we've made outside of the physical infrastructure, but in the end, we've always believed that in order to be the best, yet to partner with the best. So the decision was easy and we haven't looked back. We now have a solution and partner in place that provides us with limited potential. So it goes with those saying, we truly feel fortunate to enter 23 knowing that anything is impossible. Thanks to the Drive from Integrity Team, combined with the Drive from the Polyntyr team, and with Foundry as our platform. Thank you for listening and have a good day.
