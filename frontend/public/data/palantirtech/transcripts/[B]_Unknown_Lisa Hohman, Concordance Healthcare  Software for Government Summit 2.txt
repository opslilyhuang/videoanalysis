TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Thank you so much for your comments and I've enjoyed the commentary that we were able to have right before this and I just want you all to know I'm going to let all of my children know that I got play in music like I got walk on music today so it's a first for me. So now I'm just super excited to be here. So I come from the commercial market and I'm the CEO of Concordance Healthcare Solutions. We are a distributor of medical supplies. Let's see if I can get this to go. Perfect. So just by way of level setting, we are one of the only agnostic distribution companies in the country, most distributors manufacture their own products. We are an agnostic distributor so we buy from manufacturers and suppliers and we distribute to healthcare systems across the country. We have 20 distribution centers across this great country, a billion three in sales, about a thousand employees so just a level said you we are like that mid-tier and all of the rest of the guys are like really big. So I only tell you that because throughout the pandemic we really worked to ensure that we had a voice at those conversations. We are the largest VA contract holder for distribution and so we thought really hard to make sure that to your right to equity, equity goes all across this organization right. It's all across the country right. It's those hard to reach, those hard to serve. It's the VA's and there's a lot of things that go into that. So we really wanted to make sure that there was a voice for all of those entities as we face the crisis. They asked me to come and talk to you about the challenges of the pandemic and I only have 30 minutes so I don't know that I'm going to be able to cover much of that but I really appreciated General Pernos comments. If you can't see yourself you cannot be successful. And just a level set because most people look at healthcare and say high tech right. They have some of the best robots right. They're doing robotic surgeries or so much innovation. In supply chain, just a level set, it is in the 1980s. There is no connectivity. So if you look at a hospital, a hospital has all of these disparate systems. They might have inventory management systems. They might have procurement systems. They have epic. They have revenue generations. None of those systems talk to each other. It's insane. Then you have distribution that sits in the middle and our system sits here. So information comes from the hospital. We get information from the supplier but all of that information sits in distribution. So you heard Dr. Rousseau once we move pharmaceuticals which is not our hospice, we're on the med side. But once you move pharmaceuticals back into commercial distribution, that visibility goes down. You don't get to see where that product goes until a 60, 90 day later they send sales to the market. They're trying to produce product for this end user over here in the hospital and they have no visibility. There's no forecasting. It's insane. I was at a gardener presentation and the guy from Coke, I had to have a conversation with him. He's like, you're a medical. You have to be so much farther ahead than us. No, no we're not. So through the pandemic, it became a lot of things that I didn't know. So through the pandemic, it became really apparent that the whole system kind of in that is broken. Historically, we've always just done what we could. You just throw more people at it. You have excelsheets going back and forth. You have EDI, cutting it at GDI. Nobody was talking about APIs. So we just dealt with it. When the pandemic came, it was just so glaring that it was not acceptable and it wasn't, we weren't going to be able to survive. Some of the use cases that we saw, we are a provider into the tri-state area. As product came in from the federal government through SNS or other areas, it would get shipped into hospitals. We would help provide that shipment in. Except for the fact we didn't have, was H-POP. So they didn't know if you had a health system that needed gloves or if you had a health system that needed masks or if they needed tubing for their machines. We had no visibility. So what we did was being better spread it. Everybody got a little bit of everything. Except for the fact they didn't know what was coming. There was no bill of materials that could check in against. And people were donating product to the health systems. Literally we'd pull up to docs and you couldn't offload. Because there's just stuff. And nobody knew what this stuff was. Some of the stuff wasn't usable. And so you just had this backlog and we're like, this is crazy. Like we have got, this is 2020. We have got to have a better system than this, right? You just can't believe this stuff happens. So really some of those things just continued to happen. And so I'm super excited about H-POP because that was one of the things that we said. People should be able to request what they need from the federal government. We should be able to ship exactly what they need over. So other things that happened through the pandemic was really just taking first, making sure your employees were safe. And so those very early days, we had to ensure that we had a safe employee base. Because if we stopped shipping product, the question from HR was, if we get a case, we're going to have to shut down. I'm like, there's no shutting down, right? It's like shutting down a hospital. You can't stop medical supplies from flowing. So many more people would die. So our first priority was really getting our employees safe. And then really trying to understand where the product sat in this country. And we had no visibility. We worked closely with our federal partners. We developed relationships pretty quickly. I'm always a proponent to have those relationships built before you need them. We had a few. We didn't have enough. But really to say, OK, how do we get information from the federal government? And how do we provide the federal government information? And so Palantir and the partnership with the federal government created the supply chain control tower, all six distributors put our data into the control tower in about two and a half, three weeks. Give or take. And within two and a half, three weeks, they had it normalized. Now in healthcare, they will tell you that we can't standardize because there's no unique identifier per item. Pharmaceutical? Absolutely. There's a unique identifier, right? Everything has an NDC. Medical supplies? There is not. So in our industry, we have told ourselves four years that we can't do this. We can't normalize. We can't connect this data because there's no unique identifier. But we've proved in about five weeks that that is not a true statement. And really through technology and partnership with the federal government, we were able to say, OK, here's at least where the product sits in the country from distribution. And here's where we're sending it. But the challenge was, is they didn't have the provider information. So the providers were very reluctant to give, like, hey, this is how much I have in a warehouse. This is how much I'm using on the floor. And so you really had to build that trust within both your employees. You had to build trust with your suppliers. And we had to build trust with the providers and the federal government to say, OK, we all are better served if we provide this data so that we can better serve patients across the country. So the supply chain control tower was set up. And we were getting back from the federal government. In 96 hours, we got the top 100 counties in the country that were affected, which is great, unless that county happens to be like New York City. So that's not so helpful. If it's middle America, it's perfect. There's like two hospitals, right? You can figure that out. But really trying to get that data out of the health systems on, you know, how many patients they had, what they needed, how many masks they were going through, how many gloves they needed, all of that stuff was just super, super clunky. Then you layer in supply and allocation. So you immediately went from managing 200 at most allocated products and then get one time we were at 13, 14,000. No technology to really do that, trying to be equitable and fair where you were sending product. So that became a huge hurdle and how you managed all of that information and who got the product. But a government was helpful. They gave us priorities, right? This is the, you know, health systems are first, emergency, long-term care. They gave us priorities, which was helpful for us in those kind of throws because in those days, there was just, there was not enough product. And if we would have been able to see like where all of that information sat and be able to connect those data points quicker, we would have been able to allocate the product much more efficiently throughout the healthcare supply chain and had a much better response as we walk through that. So I go over the whole trust and during the pandemic, health systems had no idea who SNS was, how it worked. I mean, I was on calls with all the leading health systems because I sit on a board and they're like, what is SNS doing? They're not helpful. And I'm like, I don't think you actually know how this works. And so I'd know I knew it was like local government, local, the public health, that the hospitals did not understand how it worked. And so getting those people on calls with the health systems to say, this is how this actually works and how we can utilize this. And really getting that better understanding and connecting. And we've actually done some workshops and we did one in North Carolina to connect all the health systems, all the public health. And so that they have a plan moving forward and then we're utilizing that in different areas of the country so that other health systems understand that playbook and they have the connections to their public health so that the next time they need something from public health, they have an understanding of how that works. So you go into allocation, we have no visibility, we have no idea who needs what. And then the government comes in and tries to help by procuring product. So and that's awesome, right? Except for the fact they were procuring product, we were procuring product. The health systems were being very emotional, everyone was being emotional, it was crazy. People were buying products, sourcing product from all over the world, right? And it was emotional, it was reaction and basically it drove the price of products through the roof. If you had a glove that was worth two cents, we were paying 36 cents. I mean, it just was insane. And people were told the boards of hospitals were telling health care, supply chain, buy whatever you can and whatever cost. So that drove up, right? And the federal government's bidding on products, we're bidding on products, everybody's bidding on products. So it just drove that up. Now why do I bring that up? Because had we had the visibility of what true demand was, we would have known, we really don't need how many millions of, oh, anybody needs an N95, I'm your girl. We got plenty. We will not run out. But we didn't need millions and millions of N95s, right? But nobody knew and everybody was trying to do the right thing and everybody was trying to react to a market but we had no demand signal, we had no idea. And people got burnt. I mean, I know distributors that are publicly traded, we are not. But some of the publicly traded hundreds of millions of dollars that were wasted. Sometimes every health system I talk to has warehouses of stuff they will never use, right? And this just drove inefficiency and costs throughout the system. And so that's really why it was driving us to say, okay, enough's enough, this is crazy, we cannot sustain this. So we partnered with Palantir and they don't give me very many slides because I can never follow them. So that's why I just get good bullet points. I know my strengths and weaknesses. So we partnered with Palantir to say, how do we solve for this? Not, how do we solve for this? For Concordance Healthcare, the distributor, but how do we solve for this for the nation? Because it's just not acceptable. And if we don't learn from what happened, then we are, it is awful, right? We have the knowledge today in industry to solve for this, right? I've been in industry a long time. Going on 36 years, something like that. There's a lot of smart people in industry. They know the challenges that exist in the commercial market on this side. We now have the technology that connects the data easily, rapidly, layering in AI, layering in large language models so that you don't have to be an expert. You can just ask it, the question, and it will tell you. So we have created with Palantir Surgeons and it is an ecosystem for healthcare. We're having really good conversations. We have a few health systems fully connected. But basically that ontology that he showed you is very similar to what we're doing. We are connecting all the way down to par unit location, which is in the hospital systems. They have these par rooms. If you've ever been on a floor, they have these tiny little rooms with a bunch of product. We're going all the way there so that we know when that's actually used, that's the forecast. It's not when they issue a purchase order. So if you think about it, if our system accidentally orders five cases, very simple. It's about the nation. Five cases and they meant five order, five boxes. They don't return those. They keep them. But distribution and the suppliers go, oh, five cases, that's the new demand, right? So we build up supply and then they don't order forever because they're trying to use up five cases. And so we dwindle and then they order five boxes and we're like, who, we don't have five boxes, right? Because there's no line of sight to what they're actually using. And so this solution will provide industry that insight to what they're utilizing, how much distribution has. So everyone has full line of sight. The hospital can now see exactly what's sitting in all of our distribution centers that serve them. We can see what they're using every single day. And then we can take that demand forecast, push it back to the supplier and say, hey, this is what you need to, this is what you need to manufacture. And so we are going to take waste out of supply chain, which is huge today. So many items that are wasted today. We had one example from Rush University up in Chicago and they looked at their inventory and they were like, hmm, we're going to run out of this item. So it panics people, right? We're going to run out of an item. They asked the system what to do. They're like, you've got 46 days sitting over here in three west that nobody's using. They simply went over, grabbed that product, never ran out, supply chain reacted, and it was fluid. On the reverse side, you have suppliers that have no visibility on what we need and where we need it. So if I have 20 distribution centers, I place 20 POs with, let's say, 3M. 4-3M even delivers those. We're ordering another 20 POs, right? We're constantly ordering. So now they have visibility to say, hmm, not first and first out. It's instead of PO number one going, it's PO number 32 because if I can send it here, I'm going to leave the eight supply chain challenges in those warehouses. So those are simple examples of how just utilizing data, we can utilize supply in our country better and we can provide a much better outcome to patients and allow the healthcare professional to really truly provide care and not have to worry about supply chain. So how does that interact with all of you, right? So my thing is, and we're having a great conversation, it's like, how do we tie this data then eventually into the federal government? How do we use information from the CDC saying, hey, there's, we can see the outbreak coming, right? We're monitoring all this. We can see the outbreak coming. We know we're going to need more needles. Why isn't that demand signal going back through industry to say, BD, you need to start uping your manufacturing on needles today so that when this outbreak actually comes to the United States, we're prepared. That information is out there and we just need to connect it. So those are simple examples of how the public private partnership in my opinion can continue and it needs to continue because there's expertise on both sides. You guys have the public health data. We know how to get product where it needs to go. We know what shipping lines are available, we know what the docs look like, we know how to get product there. So it's really, how do we partner together to overlay the information that public health has of which you guys should have and that is your responsibility? How do we overlay that into the public market so that we can create those demand signals and make sure that our healthcare supply chain is more viable? So that is my ask of you today and I thank you all for your attention and all of the work you do every day to ensure that the American people really get the healthcare that they deserve. So thank you and I've got a couple of minutes for questions. Yes. Hi, thank you so much for the presentation. I'm Adam Friedlander, I'm with the FDA, I work on the food traceability team and I'm just wondering, so you mentioned earlier in the presentation, you know, back in 2020, there was a problem with the unique identifiers. Have you seen that, you know, issue resolved or has the industry coalesced around, you know, certain global trade item numbers or other unique identifiers and how is that information being standardized in the industry and also transmitted, like are you using like an EPCIS supply chain visibility standard or like I'm just curious about the role of unique identifiers now. So I'm going to ask you a question. So, and I don't remember whose presentation it was earlier today, but they said we do not need data standards. Right? So what I've heard from industry again is that we can't get there because we don't have them and they're like, the federal government needs to come in, we've tried, you know, G-tons, we've tried unspec, we've tried, I mean, the industry has had tried to normalize this data so many times in my tenure. I'm like, guys, if we wait for this, I'm going to be dead by the time we actually solve for it. What we were able to do with Palantir is really use AI to do those connectors. And so we don't need the data standards. We're actually able to pull the data, compare the data, and link the data pretty quickly. So are you using like purchase order dates? Like, I guess I'm trying to understand how you're connecting. I guess I'm just trying to understand, like, how is that connection being made? Like, if you're leveraging AI, like, how are those tools able to say, yeah, this product went to this facility, which went to this provider? Oh, okay. So, so when I say data standards between organizations, so everybody has a unique identifier, right? Like, I have an item number, 3M has an item number, BD has an item number, you know, on down the list, right? And it's the same item, but we all have a different item number. So those are the things that we haven't been able to connect yet. But through AI and taking the data attributes of each organization, you can mirror that information. And then to understand like where that product is moving, yes, we're using all of the data, right? We're using purchase orders. We're using ship dates. We're using Sends. We're using invoicing contract rebates. So all of that is used so that we can show where that product was shipped. And then from the hospital, we're utilizing either like an inventory management system, like a PARX, which would control kind of that end use data, or if they don't have that, we're using minmaxes. So, and once they replenish that minmax, we're using that as forecasted data. Does that help? Yeah, absolutely. Yes. So, love the idea and concept as we were discussing. What are the industry incentives to move in this direction? And is there anything the federal government needs to be thinking about to help drive those incentives? Because it's not something I think the federal government certainly is going to be able to do on loan. It's got to be driven collectively. Yeah, so it's an interesting question. The incentives really for the industry are taking just a fundamental financial model is taking the waste out. So we're able to through data and visibility identify the waste. And so that's something we've never been able to get after in this industry is really identifying that. And there's such a ton of waste, whether it's recall management, I mean, I can go on to how recalls are done. But whether it's recall management or just expired product or the manufacturer makes too much and then they want to discontinue items and they don't know when to discontinue items because they can't see this blow chain and they don't know the timing on it. It goes on and on. So really, the evidence for the industry is to reduce waste and to really get that visibility. So we've talked about this for a hundred years and this industry is getting that visibility and that's how you build trust because nobody trusts anyone in this industry because they don't have visibility. And so that's really what we're seeing now. You're seeing, and there's always first movers, right? There's people that are innovative and say, look, I'm diving in. This is what we need to do. And I think over time you'll see that more and more as more people jump on. I think you'll be able to prove out. We were able to, at rush alone, they were able to eliminate two FTEs in just back order management. And that was just one use case, right? And so they went from having two FTEs doing it full time to one FTE 30 minutes a day. Just with the visibility because they knew what was coming, what we had, what the supplier had, whether the POs, the, whether there was any variability on the POs, actually, reaching us with the due dates. So all of that information plays into how variable is the item and do they think it's going to be out. So eliminating waste is the number one goal. Connecting trading partners to have a better experience is number two. How the federal government could play a role? I'd love to have that conversation because it really is about how do we utilize the best of the federal government and the best of the commercial market to improve population health, right? I do think that there is definitely a play and how we get there. I know that at least during the pandemic, the providers weren't really excited about giving the government data. But we are the, and people ask me all the time why you, like, why did your organization decide to take this on one? We met Palantir and realized we could do it. To, I love challenge. I love it when people tell me it's impossible. So those are reasons, but we're also the trusted partner in the industry. So we were just named on Gartner's top 15 collaborative companies in our space. And we're the small, people tell me I shouldn't say small. We're the midsize company, right? So for us to make that list, I mean, the other people that make that list are the people that you always see, right? But for the first time, we made that list. And we are the trusted partner. Our Montreas were going to do the right thing every time. It doesn't matter. Always do the right thing. Good eventually wins. But we really want to solve, solve for these issues. And I think the federal government could weigh in on this and provide help there. But I think that's probably pretty, it could be a broad conversation that we would love to have. All right. Anybody else? All right. Well, thank you guys so much for your attention.
