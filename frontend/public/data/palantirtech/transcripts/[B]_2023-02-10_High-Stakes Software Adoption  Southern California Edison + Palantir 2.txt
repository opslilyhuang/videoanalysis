TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

So, let's see, recap from the morning. Alex's hair, awesome. Real, by the way. Supply chain, AIDS pandemic, pretty serious, JD powers, cars and trucks, awesome stuff. Now, you're going to hear about wildfires. So welcome to California. So you're going to hear about wildfires from not just me, on the Chief Information Officer for Southern California Edison. You're also going to hear from PG&E. So you're going to hear a lot about wildfires. And in our environment, wildfires happen since, I don't know, about 2017 is about 8,000 wildfires a year, pretty significant damage in the billions and significant loss of life. So I'm going to talk a little bit about Southern California Edison. I'm going to tell you a tiny little bit about myself. So I work for a public utility. We are 135, over 135 years old. I'm not over 135 years old, by the way. There's a lot of ingrained process. And there's things don't move quite as slowly at a public utility, let's say maybe as a volunteer. So I started my career out. I was thinking about the ambassador talking about the federal government. My very first job at a college I worked for NASA. I was a flight structures engineer and it was the coolest job in the world, except for it was super boring because I worked for the federal government. So I left because it was way too boring. And then I was thinking to myself, I think my career went terribly awry because I went from the federal government over 25 years ago to now working at a utility with a similar reputation as the federal government. That was a joke audience participation. Okay, thank you. All right, so what I want to talk about is we are not our great grandfather's utility. They were actually doing a lot of really cool things to help the citizens of Southern California prevent the spread of wildfires and save loss of life and property. So we have a very ambitious set of goals in California, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by, I think it's 30% by 2030. That means we are committed to electrifying all of California. That means, to talk about cars again, that means more electric vehicles, more electrification of buildings, getting rid of gas appliances potentially, you may have heard a little bit about that, we did not start that rumor. But that is what's to come for the future. And we cover 50,000 square miles. Our power lines actually can be wrapped around the earth four times. Nobody has ever tried that, but I'm interested in doing it. So we are heavily regulated industry. Everything we do, the way we make money is we don't make money off of selling electricity. We make money by investments in infrastructure. The way we get approval for these infrastructure is we go to the public utility commission and we make a four year rate case and we ask for money. One thing goes for wildfire mitigation. We make a case for all the things that we are entertaining to reduce the potential spread for wildfires. We make a case for that and we get money to support it. So everything we do is heavily regulated and you are like boy, your job sounds really boring. And I promise you it's not because I'm going to tell you how this old utility accomplished, pretty amazing things in just a couple of months. I know for many of you a couple of months sounds like a really long time, but for us, where we are very focused on projects with very long cycle times, which are not months, but years, a couple of months, a couple of weeks is pretty amazing for us. And then the other concept that I really want to talk about is we have a lot of mitigations in place, but one of those is sort of the tool of last resort. So if there is a spread of wildfire, we've done everything we possibly can do to mitigate it. We have this thing called public safety power shut off, which you'll probably also hear about later. It's sort of the tool of last resort where we turn off people's power. Which doesn't make us really popular, especially if it's Thanksgiving, and we turn off your power and your refrigerator doesn't work. So we see a growing trend with wildfires. Like I said, 8,000 a year, billions of dollars of damage. We have this other concept in California. It's called inverse condemnation. If say somebody is driving, drunk, they hit a pole. The pole goes down. Pole catches fire. We're liable. So the burden of proof is on the utility to make sure that actually it wasn't our fault. Right? So it's less about worrying about our reputation. It's actually a lot more about protecting our 15 million customers in California. So anyway, keep going. Like I said, long decision cycles, things typically take a longer time, but this is an example of what can happen with severe winds. Now in California, this is about as cold as it gets. I'm in Southern California. So if it's anywhere below 60 degrees, I'm freezing. I grew up in New Jersey. It's all over for me. So like I said, what we do is we file not only a rate case, but we also file a wildfire mitigation plan. There's a series of things we do. We look at these things like a layer defenses. So installing thousands of miles of covered conductors prevents the potential of a spark. Making trees is basically eliminating the potential that will fuel the fire itself. We've done almost $2 million, $2 million trims over the last year. We're trying to reduce whatever the potential is where there could be a spark. Like things like even mylar balloons, which we can't outlaw in California because people still do it. Those things also can drive a spark. We have thousands of weather stations. We have one of the largest weather forecasting, weather predictive capabilities in all of California. And we're doing these things because then we could have a better weather model to predict whether there might be a high potential for fire. So in Southern California and in Northern California, it's not the temperature itself, but the high winds themselves. And if there's a spark, can rapidly spread the fire. So we have all these things we do. And like I said, the last resort is this thing called public safety power shut off. So unfortunately, this is the devastating damage that can occur. Now in a public safety power shut off, what might happen is we run all these things. There's this kind of period of concern where we see the high winds. We're looking at all the forecasts and we're thinking, uh-oh, the fire predictive index is telling us that we may need to shut people's power off. So then what we need to do, we need to leverage the data because we have to make sure that while the big data is super important, the small concrete data is even more important. Are you on a circuit that's in an under a period of concern? If the data is wrong and we tell you we're going to shut your power off and we don't, or we tell you we're not going to shut your power off and we do, right? So we can't afford those consequences. We owe it to our customers to do better for them. So data is a big challenge. It's a super important, I mean, with bad data, people could die. Like that's how severe it is. We need to make sure we preserve the lives of our customers. And then the last thing we do is we need to communicate with them. So when we looked at it, it was like, hey, we have a big data problem itself. And so we were using, which we were all fond of, using Excel spreadsheets. And we had very much, it was a people-centric process. If you knew about the process, you understood the process, you were obsessed with Excel, which a lot of us, I actually was a great pivot table person back in the day, but no longer. So not a lot of great repeatability there, right? Like very dependent on individuals and the process was slow and error prone and took a really long time. And you think about minutes and hours really matter and wait for Excel spreadsheet or somebody that has the data to update, it's way too long. So we had to change. And then, so what we did was, we looked around, there's a variety of systems we need to change. We need to look at the data. What is a combination of things we could have? Where it's going to improve the accuracy of the data. The data is going to flow. We need workflow. We need to connect it to all of our other systems. And so that actually led us to balance here. And balance here, I would say, was among a portfolio of technology changes we made to improve the overall process. And then here's our sort of obligatory architecture. It just shows you there's a variety of partners. I saw somebody raise a hand earlier from Microsoft. There's Microsoft, Google, GE, SAP, and of course, Palantir Foundry was right in the middle of this. And so for us, a very quick release process. Within three months, if you think about the millions of potential data sets we had and just converting all that and building out the ontology, making sure we had that firm platform in place, we rolled something out in three months, initial release, another release, three months later. We got it into production. For us, super fast. We saw successful 12 different use cases very focused on PSPS. And that was in 2022. So it achieved a lot of objectives now. Some of the challenges people, like data is great. I think Ambassador also talked about people and politics. We don't quite have the political issue. Well, we do in California. But specific to Southern California Edison, the challenges people get married to their old processes. And so we need to get people excited and motivated to change. We had 400 people that we need to educate. There's thousands of people at Southern California Edison that were myopically focused on mitigating the spread of wildfires. So we need to include just about everybody in that process. And we iterated on this. And so we had this kind of hybrid thing where I look at it like an old Viking days where they would burn their boats so they made a commitment to move forward. Well, we don't, well, first of all, we don't like to use the word burn. But burning our boats, which we probably should have done, and just getting rid of the old process, probably would allowed us to move forward a lot more quickly than we did. But even with that, we've iterated. We educated people. We trained them. And now we have a new robust process. That's part of our daily operations as we enter into wildfire season. So a really great level of improvement. Obviously, we've got the ontology, reduction in inaccurate and mis-customer notifications. And we were able to integrate various weather forecasting models in a very quick manner and adapt the software. So one of the things that I heard this morning was, what was that the minimum viable product that we use? I guess we throw that out now. It's not an obsolete term. So that's the process that we use. Apparently, we're going to have to change that. But one of the other things that we did was, again, ultimately, it's about communicating with our customers. So not only did we have the Foundry platform in place, we also had to rapidly change our maps, improving the user experience for our customers, making sure that the Foundry platform could ingest thousands of points that different weather models. So we had to do all those things. And that all happened really, really quickly. So some data for all of us, 60% reduction in mis-customer notifications, making a difference in hours and minutes for us was very significant. And you could see how much data we had to ingest in a very short amount of time. Imagine doing all that within Excel spreadsheet. It does not scale. It's not repeatable. It's also not reportable, which is really important to what we do from a compliance perspective. So what's on the horizon? I'm going to move pretty quick because I think I'm kind of out of time. So here's our ontology that we built that. We're going to leverage that as much as possible in future use cases. Obviously, we're going to use that for a level of regulatory reporting. There's a series of use cases. They're all related to how we better leverage our data. And then for the utility, I would say in our industry writ large, it's a pretty transformational time for us. So historically, I would say our grid was sort of a modem would be an exaggeration, but very serially connected. Right? There's a lot of disconnected assets. What we see is this large convergence between IT to OTS. We're taking hardware assets that were disconnected from the grid and we're IP connecting them. We're building this massive network of networks. And so we're moving from kind of hardware to software to find. And that means the potential is unlimited. We're digitizing the grid. And as we're digitizing the grid, we can use a lot of other tools, including Foundry, but also with drones to do inspection. We could put more artificial intelligence and machine learning at the edge so that before a wildfire actually occurs or even well before that, we'll fly drones to do inspection. We're using LiDAR. So all these things aren't sort of being dreamed up. They're actually happening right now. And so that requires to us is more engineers, more data scientists, more people that understand the value of data. Because the data ultimately will set all of us free. And I think for us, hopefully I've conveyed to all of you that we're not a sleepy utility, but we don't adapt practices at 135 years old. That it's a very exciting time to be in utility industry. So our time has finally come. We're at super exciting. And I look, I say to my team, it's sort of the rise of the, I was an engineer. It's rise of the engineers and the geeks and the data scientists. So thank you all for your time and attention. Really appreciate it. So have a great rest of your conversation.
