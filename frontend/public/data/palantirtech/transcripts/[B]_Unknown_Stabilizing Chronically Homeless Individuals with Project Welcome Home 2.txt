TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

The current state of homelessness in the U.S. is pretty bleak. On any given night in January 2015, there were about 600,000 homeless individuals. It's down to Clara County each night. There are about 6,500 individuals who are homeless. That includes men, women and children. Twenty-two hundred of those individuals each night have been homeless for many years, sometimes decades. A lot of chronically homeless individuals, especially, have not only chronic medical conditions, but also behavioral health conditions like mental illness and substance use. We found that homeless individuals and families utilize, on average, $520 million worth of services each year. Generally, the county is trying to get homeless individuals stabilized and in housing. In the traditional fee-for-service structure, the service providers are incentivized to provide a lot of services, but aren't directed towards specifically meeting those wellness and cost reduction objectives. And so one of the challenges has always been, how best can we align our incentives as the county with our contractors? Performance-based contracting is a new concept where governments really look at the services they're providing and really focusing on outcomes and only paying a provider if those outcomes are achieved. When we first looked at pay-for-success, we were trying to identify the programs that really were going to apply and where pay-for-success was going to be a vehicle that worked. And we selected homelessness because homelessness is an issue that is one of our most difficult problems and one that's very important to our community. Well, at a boat, we've known for years that we have an intervention that really works, which basically is housing with wraparound services to keep people housed. We saw the opportunity to enter into a project where we would be paid adequately to provide this intervention and it would be measured so we could actually see our success. So the role of UCSF in the PFS program is that we help design the randomized control trial study design and we're the program evaluator for the 6.25-year project. One of the challenges in working with administrative data is that data are often siled from one another. So healthcare data don't speak to behavioral health data, don't speak to data from the jail system and often those don't speak to housing data. And especially for chronically homeless individuals who are interacting with all parts of the accounting system, you really need all those data sources to get a complete picture. One of the biggest challenges that we face in trying to better utilize our data is complying not only with all of the legal protections that must be complied with very thoughtfully in order to utilize that data and that's been a consistent challenge that we face, that other governments around the country have faced and we knew we had to figure out a solution for. When Pallantair was approached for this project, we knew we had to do it. It was right at the intersection on types of projects we like to work on. First, there's a clear need for data and better data infrastructure. Second, it's mission oriented and socially impactful. Third, is that it really values outcomes which is core to Pallantair's philosophy and fourth, it's right in our backyard. Pallantair built an integrated data platform that links across key social services databases to provide a holistic view of homeless clients within the county. So now a boat, UCSF and the county can all log into the system and see not only real time how the program is tracking, but also be able to look at trends and do analyses on how to make social services better in the future. When I get in the morning, the first thing I want to do is to see where all my clients are what services they've utilized or if I'm trying to locate a client. So I'm going to directly go to the newsfeed and there's a feature on here where I'm able to just show my clients. I'm looking at my clients and I can see that a lot of my clients have appointments coming up so I just want to make sure that they're making it to their appointments. One of my clients was just permanently housed this week. That's good. And then I'm going to go over to Trend Explorer and I'm going to click on my client load here and I'm able to see who has been utilizing resources most recently. So I can see somebody's had a larger amount of utilizations. I'm able to know like, okay, this person's maybe even used like resources. Maybe they need a little bit more contact or see what's been going on with them. So I'm able to check in on them a little bit more. Hey, good morning everybody. As you can see, we've got slate pulled up and so we're going to go over some of the trends we've been noticing. One of the things I want to highlight is we do have a couple of clients that you can see here that have been using their in-read. They've been using a little more services than we would like. So we want to make sure that we are connecting with those folks and having them high on our radar. I also wanted to point out sometimes that we get caught in the work and we forget about all the good things that we're actually doing. This graph here at the bottom, everyone can see it every day, but those numbers before the zero, the zero right here, those numbers are the amount of services that our clients were using before we housed them. And those little, intermediate graphs, such as the right of the zero, that's all the services they have been using since we housed them. That shows the dedication and the hard work that you guys have been doing. So I really want to acknowledge that this is a big deal. But let's really drill down into some of the clients that we've been working on. So I know Jesse, we wanted to talk about Robert. Yes. So let's... Robert was a client who, as a team, all of us had a lot of difficulty locating him. So when I went on to Palantir and I looked at the trend explorer, I was actually able to see using the utilization tab. Exactly what he was using, which was the emergency department. And so using this, we noticed a trend that started happening. He was there if you can see almost every day. So we actually went to VMC to try to see at the hospital if he was still there and he had already been discharged. So we went and just walked around the whole hospital just on foot. And we were able to locate him. There across the street at the McDonald's. So our team now actually sees in real time the differences in behavior and differences in seeking out of services that is happening with each of our clients in real time. That's very powerful. I think governments can benefit from this type of project because it shows that researchers can really work with people from government and kind of really work together to bring the resources that researchers often need, like these disparate data sources, but don't always have access to together so that we can actually do research the generate outcomes that can inform policy and that's really evidence-based. There have been so many hurdles that we've had to deal with in terms of privacy and civil liberties in order to really effectively leverage our data, but having Palantir as a partner in that work has been really exceptional because they themselves are on the cutting edge of figuring out how to use data while staying in clear compliance with all of the restrictions and protections that need to exist. So right now we're going to go visit Robert at our cost of the Nova location that Abode just currently took over. We put all of our clients in there who are waiting for their permanent housing. Robert is a veteran. He was in the United States Navy for 17 years and he was also a Navy SEAL. So we're going to go meet with him and he's going to talk a little bit about his experience with Abode and now being in transitional getting ready for his permanent housing. It's like hell week. That was an old chair talk. But yeah, limb from capsule from doing this and doing that. It was drunk. I don't, well not drunk but I was drinking. Full of one alcohol look and you guys helped me taper down and I am tapered down and almost done. You guys give me a place to come to and I respect you because you guys respect me and I think you guys are the greatest people in the world. Our paper for Success Project is nine months in and we're above the metric. Successful. Very chronically homeless people who are living on the streets a year ago are now in their own homes. And they're doing quite well and because of data we also know that they're utilizing a lot less very expensive services that the county and others provide. I think that other governments really have been paying attention to what we're doing here in Santa Clara County because the idea of really focusing on outcomes and measuring outcomes is really a direction that all government has to move in. Being located in Silicon Valley we always pride ourselves even in the government sector on doing things a little bit differently and a little bit better to the extent that we can. One of the things I'm most excited about regarding this project is that our work with all the different entities involved including PoundSeries really allowed us to actually leverage that data in the way it can be leveraged to make a meaningful difference on behalf of clients and a better spend taxpayer dollars. We know that permit the support of housing is an effective strategy. We know that we need to improve it. We know that we need to make it sustainable. And if we can make it sustainable then we can really expand this and serve not just 100, 200, chronically homeless individuals but we can serve the 2200 that are still out there on the streets. The end of the day it's easy to forget that the intervention is about people who without our assistance will have a very miserable life and or die young. So I'm most excited about the fact that we're transforming people's quality of life on a daily basis, say they're on homes and they're able to start to think about the other things they want to do to have a quality of life that the rest of us expect. Thank you.
