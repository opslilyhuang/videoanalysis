TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I'm going to jump up here to make this introduction because it's so important to me before stand and Alex come up here. So for those of you who don't know Alex Karp and Miss the 344% rise in his stock this year to date, your to date, it's more as paying attention to this guy and all that he is doing in the defense and intelligence communities. And I think this is probably even if you're not a stock owner, one of us important conversations, I'll come for you. And to have all of us listen to and long before the stock won up 344% year to date, Skandrick and Miller was his original investor and we couldn't be more pleased than Skand also took the call to say, could you please make this conversation? It's super interesting between the two of you and I don't know which one should interview which but hopefully it will be an unresettered and open conversation that goes wherever it goes. Stan, as all of you know, was one of the most successful investors actually of our time, 30% compounded returns of Sauros, just a legend, beyond legends and so we're so lucky to have them. But before they come up, I was able to see here 150 copies of Alex's book that doesn't come out until February, so we have bootleg copies and it's about the technological republic, hard power, self belief and the future of the West and he's going to go a little bit into this. But Mr. Isaacson said that it is one of the most important reeds that we will have and so I think it's important that we get it inside and look and some of your fellow palitarians are here Alex. I didn't know the word palitarian until I discovered that they are both existing employees as well as former employees and it is a fault that is what this is all about and it's a very important cult that has changed in the shape of the world and controlled it much of how the world order is going to happen. So with that I really, really appreciate both Stan and Alex joining us today. And I think that's one of the most important cultural Americans running one of most cultural companies in the world and sometimes it's better to be lucky than smart. In 1976 my boss at Mentor in Pittsburgh told me there was a man coming in the next day and that no one had ever heard of him but this man was going to be a force election state close to the rest of my career. There was 48 years ago in the next day at my kid lane gone and for the first 15 years it was kind of my little secret not many people knew kid lane gone and then he became I think why I think recognize this as an actual treasure. 15 years ago Peter Dillon drew us we another man. Most of you probably didn't hear of 15 years ago Alex Clark and maybe for the first four or five years people had not much about Alex Clark. Again I thought I could have seen her not most of the public but I'm delighted that the email has become a national treasure and recognized figure and both these men are the same men that I've met before they were famous. They have more morals than anybody I've ever met and Alex is the United States citizen who we're so lucky to have you and it's not an end to you today so I do have a question for you though. I think the budget software engineers you want to have for college, philosophy major, then you get a lot of green and you have a PhD in nail classical. There I think it's called nail classical social theory. I don't know what they all that is but it does sound like a software engineer. Peter Dillon has been amazing at picking leaders of companies. Why do you think you picked you and can you just tell us about how it all happened in the beginning? Well first of all it means a lot to me I'll say it with you and I don't think Stan needs an introduction to this audience. But I really keep profiting a lot in many ways from many many interactions and there's the moral force that you are. There's also the cognitive force and the kind of outsider person you made it very much related to you. Thank you. Yeah I have no mercy clue what Peter picked me. I thought about this a lot. Peter and I were sparring partners and friends in law school. I needed every minute of law school. I thought it's like moral sophistry in the service of prestige and I understand both but it's just not my thing. My only finishing was my grandfather was basically an immigrant and I figured I couldn't really bring in any past away in my first year of law school. But I couldn't really bring telling him I was trying to be at school. But if I had to surmise it's like Peter and I very much disagreed on the outcomes of the suppositions of our arguments but we very much agreed on what it meant to make a strong argument and the suppositions that went into a strong argument and the level of rigor you needed to be plausibly even wrong. And we would battle over political use then more kind of as now or in the right I was at the time a classic progressive I still am unfortunately. I was at the part that part of America has been turned over to a big religion that is not in a way chained not in a wrong way. And I think culturally why did I was very honored when you asked me to speak but I did say just move you ask me to speak then you know you ask me to speak so I do think my father's on my family is German Jewish Peter is German you cannot. There was a cultural affinity that's definitely true. There are some very dramatic aspects of Paladir I can go into. But the end of the day I think all great great great this is artistic I think Peter is an artist in picking town I think if you asked him he would give you an answer but the real answer is he recognizes an artist from the season artist and we worked very effectively together. And by the way it wasn't just the thing it wasn't just no one else would have picked me to run anything. And I mean I said but I think there's picking and promoting and giving you know operational authority to all of which Peter has done very very unusual. And I would say our dialogue one of the things that has made us around people fall or company maybe you should have followed his closer but hopefully you've enjoyed us I wish you had a very good holiday if you did. I would say the rigor of our dialogues where you can have I'm not really trying to impose why opinion on him and even though when we started the company there was a massive statute difference it really was about having a very rigorous opinion that you could defend. And inside Palantir you know we've there's lots of things about us but I think the thing is the thing that's special about us is the platform that changed the course of archivist you and terrorism that was built by us the platform that changed the art of history on the battlefield the first actual use of the eye on the battlefield the first actual most attacked for you today is not largely controls was built by us project even. The way in which software is managed in on trend will be managed by us the most useful most impactful by any standard in US gone commercial platform in the world foundry was built by us the platform that ended up being the only thing on the market useful for managing large language models is built by us. The view that large language models would be the management of the resource as opposed to the resource itself was a radical now everybody that I want to copy it the way we organize almost every defense to extort up is an expel. I don't think you can even get investment in enterprise software at this point without any kind without an expel. I think we're trying to copy what we're doing and the idea to organize a do a TPO and engage non professional investors in essentially army was I'm proud of organized by us and me. The death and pain that is brought to our enemies mostly not exclusively brought by volunteer the more opportunity to stand up for Israel when on October 8 was done in great part by us and some others but we lead into that battlefield using large language models moving to small to large devices powered in the operating system by us. And it goes on and on and on and on and on and the best talent organized talent in enterprise software in the world is far not talented and that's been true for 20 years. It's one thing to have a startup where you have the bias speak of the parent of town but we're 20 years in and if you ask any venture person people who do whatever they and some of them have liked me do like now actually I'm pretty popular but in more aligned actually venture community because it's newly. And actually I would say stood up when the Israel was under mass of assault and it was popular in especially Europe where it's been in my life. Play more problems on the juice or innovation does work. Our software is she doesn't work our tech industry doesn't work but we can go to an international court to pretend human race abuses are happening where they're not and. Complete other intellectual. Gringe level BS work you know universities dedicate themselves to being anti prejudice except for when it comes on and on and on very proud of these things. We're very very light with Western values even saying Western values are superior and obvious I think this is an obvious fact but certainly it's an obvious fact if you're religious racial minority or you're on the. That was somehow controversial I think still is don't know why. It's been kind of we're very familiar to see no one about here cares where you went to school your parents is what your background is it's the next pound chance here. They won't test to we've been saying the same thing for 20 years. And you're saying it's honestly one of the weird things about how it here is I am saying the same thing for the last 20 years but in any case it's the fresh and new. I don't know if that's a long we did answer your question. I talked about the Ontario's term of her for many years being called. In the talent that you saw as come on there is still me what was your. Because where I get no sexual benefits but it just be clear that's a weird call with no sentence and very little drugs and we're not poisoning anyone but. I don't want to tell what I was. What I heard was some of the best talent the engineers come out of these schools when they go to the. That's always a good sign what was your. How did you get the kids and then in the period where there was maybe a whole all in perception about your company. Well first of all the talent I think it is an individual fact we we were the best in the fair and I in our town acquisition. In fact that's the only thing that anyone ever believed where we were out what is that you know I mean it was you start with the founding team it was Peter me Joe Stefan Nathan. And all of us called our smartest friends and said we're going to change the world. I mean we were maybe looked like hyperbolic we're basically saying we're going to be the talent here today. In fact we would send out these offer letters with you can pick high cash or high equity and and high equity was we'd get to $20 million people could so angry. This is a total ripoff and we call it something I would say and then I was H.O. use I think pretty famous now. Bob McGrill went on to the one in the founding fathers of our language models and I were very very focused on hiring. And it was like compounded quickly because if you're being Bob McGrill is one of the more talented people of the planet and anyone who comes into his presence who's talented just like wow okay I'm going to work with you know. And then this went on and on the second you know and then we went from one person to another. There's so many funny stories but Bob McGrill came to me one day he's like hey Alex I mean you're viewing this guy right right is the smartest maybe this one as far as human being I've ever met. And he's like what's it like to me and someone smarter than you. That was the premature culture of something to be do honestly it was not a social benefit. But and and then it was like very high mission very high-bringer very low pay very high equity we live together. It just was a really cool vibe and there was nothing like it it was like and then people who came in the contact with it knew it. Now the outside mental role needed us but on the inside it might it also reminded me a lot like my parents were like this very unusual couple. And on the inside things were very happy and on the outside everyone thought we were freaks and there was that kind of made us even happier on the inside. And our parents are truth seeking justice seeking fairness fanatics that are snobby justifiably about their intellect but not based on where you went to school or there's a new push responsibility into their area of expertise and take and take over. And and are addicted to the culture the negative side of expo interiors as they often don't want to work for anyone who didn't go to and they're not convinced by workers like I mean that's platforms I mentioned my success is getting to believe that my ideas are theirs but there is no way no volunteering I can't like a real order like a IP which is our thing I launched there are very many things that they will not just fall over. So if you develop a vector to be if you have a right track record of being right especially where they thought they were wrong I think in that way they would be classically good investors the classic good investors I'm down with an almost sleep incredible investors like you. If I tell you something and I come back to you five years later especially if you thought I was stupid and I was right that's the present. So and that's how the parents are it's like yeah that's really stupid and then if you're right they listen to you. There's no there's but you really struggle to get lateral hotters we have a couple like Gallagher joint is working out but then you have no ability to do a volunteer until you've proven yourself from the battlefield. And I bring people into my office and let them prove themselves but that's it's very low authority very high I decide for myself. I would say from a kind of military perspective people make fun it's very hard to get these consensus things to work but once they work they people take on responsibility and you would not believe we're 3600 people and name them. The name back we have it's only 3600 and we're not planning to be 10,000 because organize directly and I was with the leverage that we now have in our products and with AI you can power all industries with 100 people. I had the prevention of reading the typo on the court public as we can. Alex is not the evidence when they've stuck in 73 dollars but it's one of the most important books I've ever read and I would urge everyone to get the chance to read this book and they can act on the alert and done. I'd like to delve open into one of the big themes of the book. There was a real, this should all I met with you is government and our nation. We're defense industry with our space in the street and that to things like GPS, salt and milk internet and then somehow over the years that bond broke and the industry started to get launched to them. The questions that advertising and very important concerns like group on tickets or things as opposed to the original state. It feels to me though like Alex now that it's become clear that the next phase of national offense and down one or half a series of software and AI, it feels like there's some momentum for the family to stop projecting US defense. And work with the government potentially going forward to claim some of the advisers to the new administration. How do you feel about this whole topic and might be overly optimistic that things are turning with regard to the new government. And we have a turn to come up on this whole line of the street. Well, I mean things have come a long way. We have project made in which is targeting apparatus of the US government was going to be covered by Google. My version of how it happened was somebody on the search team. It's a little bit of a character but raised her hands and said well, if you know if helping the US government is part of my job, I'm going to leave. And they're like screw that and they pulled out and they pulled out at a particularly painful time and AI was a complete joke at the time. We thought it might not be a joke someday and then we built. The DUD by the way has made a huge mistake and I've told them this private a thousand times but they should expose aspects of private project made into the US population. Not the parts that are obviously you know, but because one of the big issues we have in society is obviously in the generation crisis we spend all this money on things and people perceive the none of it works. So, but at the time it was a few lessons and student support the US government or say anything through US. I think that I do think it's changed quite a bit. I think it's changed for good reasons that you've always said I support that but also quite frankly because the values realized you just cannot play key. The anti-intellectual left and don't destroy your business and and then I think that view was accelerated. By the way, I don't mean the progressive progressive like I view myself and I think some people are probably where you believe in fairness, but I think that the inputs even across society you accept that the outputs will not be evenly distributed. The basic things that I think most people believe. So, I think and I think that got exacerbated quite frankly after October 7th. I think Silicon Valley has been the most rational in response to. The greatest hero attacks and where almost everyone in the valley even if they don't speak publicly was very much on the side of defending the West. I think that did. There's also the negative we just can't partner with these people. They will destroy everything they touch and there's no rational conversation. But then on the positive side, I think a couple of things have happened like one. Whatever venture community bless their souls is a physical community and you know, the challenge is that we should just change things. So, like, you know, people are like, wow, it can make a lot of money and it is much harder than it looks. But it is getting easier every day because of reforms and because of the level of talent that is coming into things or government. I'm very supportive of this. I am much more optimistic than most people that there will be at least some monochrome of change. As you can see, there's kind of a view that will make a difference. I think people just as a construct. We were managing software and software systems 10 years ago where the criminal lift was just nothing. But it is now so big that you just have to get pockets where you succeed and almost have to size. And I do think you'll know that there's no succeed at that. And then I think our society is just crying for things that work. People are really disgusted with my version of it. The instruments of measurement have been corroded everywhere. It's like pick your favorite instrument of measurement. It's been corroded and politicized. And then it does not work. And Western societies are tired of this. Everyone is pretty much across our whole society. It's just sick of... But wait a minute. My school is in a school. My border is in a border. My United Nations is not the United Nations. My government is doing X, Y and Z. But it's all influencers who are outflow. And then the other side is more now, like the side. I do. And again, I've been a classic kind of progressive. I probably have to be independent now. But it's like the alternative is what things that obviously don't work. Like no one believes they're ever going to work. Most of it, many people, but too scared to say, hey, that doesn't work. Eventually, I think there's just a tiredness with this. And then we have really ruthless, cunning, long-term thinking adversaries. So it's not like you get a chance to rest these things will be contested. And you see them. And then there's labs, like you see, everyone in military tech, so it happened to New York and worked. Everyone saw what happened and worked in Israel. And then there's US commercial, which is the most dynamic interest in things are just blossoming. So Alex, there's a troll in the Wall Street Journal swine, admitting the fact that an extra, I can't remember, 35 or 40 billion, has been taken down the defense budget that would have been put in. There's all this excitement about those. And regard to defense is the issue of cutting programs, reducing costs, or as an allocation of resources in your book, you talk about, you have 35, close to 2 trillion. And that's how not worse you're going to be. That's not going to be the important way to fight our adversaries in 15 or 20 years. So is it more important to reallocate departments in some way today? Or look, there is everybody in the attention you spend an output or anyway, correlate it except for it in person. So like obviously you begin with how do we spend less again more? And it's very self-serving for me to want that because that's going to be an answer for counter. But it's also a trip of, you know, it's like we need things like, you know, we usually look at what's happening in Israel, Ukraine, or in general, ask the simple business question, where do I have an advantage, where adversaries are bad with what the world's best to solve for, the world's best in AI, and we're fighting with hardware, which of course there's some amount of hardware we need. But then if you look at the battlefield in Ukraine, like you know, with jamming devices that are now everywhere in the battlefield, a lot of that hardware is hard to deploy, so you have to deploy basically software control, many hardware devices with payloads, and that's all software plus large language models, plus smart people, plus drones. Now that doesn't mean the total number of budget has to go there tomorrow, but it does mean that that's where, and also, then you get to the ethical dimension, when you're putting someone on a human being or thousands of human beings on a hardware device, you're pretty supposing that they may die. But what if you know they're going to die, that you deploy it. It's like saying, a lot of this stuff also, you could even forget the price, just like if our ability to scare enemy is obviously less, if we're hampered by our own morality, which is like, of course, Americans are not going to allow 10,000 people to die on the battlefield as easily as our adversaries. What if it's not 10,000 adversaries? What if it's 10,000 drones powered by Mountain? And that's something we happen to be the best at, so there's the moral side of it, which is we do not work at parity technologically, but we're not at parity morally because Russia, Iran, China do not think about human rights that we do. And then you get to the cost and the legitimacy of it, which is, I mean, I'll give you a different slightly more philosophical riff. I would encourage everyone to think about each ridden, which I've added, articulating, which is in general technology, in three on a softwares of enterprise, where you're supplying parasitic technologies to enterprises that pay you because they have to, and they don't like you. So, and consumer internet, which is a similar form of parasitic, you are the host, and you get slower and dumber, but the person running it gets richer and smarter, that we're in a different phase now, where institutions are essentially becoming essentialist, which means they're actually going back to what is the institution. I think one of the reasons why Trump has been so successful is, it's something on the back of a philosophical movement, which is that, the industry actually has to go back to, I build tractors, what is the cost of the tractor? You're not in the industry of building tractors to hire a software company that has a higher multiple, you've got to get, you've got to make your tractor company, or your drone company, or your military. The purpose of a military is to scare the adversary and make your troops safer. But then we have this massive institution, and it's like, well, is the purpose of the military? That is to create revenue for every sting. Is the purpose of the military to build technologies with the past that have, and then you have this huge problem that is very hard to solve, especially for Western Europe, which is the primary purpose of many Western European defense budgets, is to provide their citizens with income. That's not the purpose of a military, but that is the purpose functionally of many of their military purchases. So we're regressing or reminding you going forward to every single institution is going to have to say, this is my purpose, this is what we spent, this is the output, and the output has to be greater than the input. And that sounds simple, but it's very hard to do in scale, and it was not possible to do in scale, but it is now. And because it's possible, people are yearning for it, and when you see people do this, I mean, look at Israel's success on the battlefield. That's part of the reason. It's like, because they are not conflicted, it's like, our job is to win on the battlefield, while maintaining our own ethical standards. Look at the impact. So it sounds like Ukraine was about a moment of something you had figured out ten or fifteen years ago for the US government. And so that accelerators are just like a recrosser, recombinant of the legacy. So I mean, figuring out when the rate of acceleration is, I'll leave to greater lengths. Like, I do. I think the interesting thing about it is, to your point, ten years ago, these were like getting me out of the office kind of discussions. And like, I would meet people quite literally, and like the sub-basement, double-stubbed old basement, but the road building, because you were allowed to be seen with us, that are also supportive of them. Well, yeah, but, so it's now moved to, we know this is true, or we believe this will be true. How can we implement it, and what are the hurdles to stopping us from doing it? It's interesting because our system can be, or we don't want to talk about the safety of AI. But, if we have this big advantage of AI, or the battlefield, and we need to have a big advantage, because they don't have the moral restrictions we have, it kind of makes sense a little bit absurd about the safety argument, because trying to approach our own, like, bad, I'm going to have the service, they're not going to slow down, AI being, because of theirs, and if we let them catch us, I'll be surprised. Well, I'll give you, not, I'm not here to push my book, I don't know if you're probably somebody here, okay? Thank you, but I don't have a peer-to-peer phone, but I'm not trying to add it to your page, so if I don't know you, the small one, or the book, I appreciate it, I appreciate it, I'm a delusion. I did my PhD in the University of Frankfurt, and I said, basically, I had this job, or I was basically the classical immigrant, I went to papers, I did all the work, I got a new credit, which I was very happy, but, and so, one of the things I came to believe that is the Genesis of a lot of ideas in the book is, we always believe that our ideas of democracy were accepted in Saint Germany, obviously, of a high opinion of Western Europe and Germany, particularly, but my interactions with people in Germany, especially people who are older and in the countryside you were very, very, very, very young, was much more like, all this stuff seems crazy, we didn't believe it, but it didn't leave to a higher standard of living, and therefore we adopted it. As opposed to, we adopted it because it's obviously more really right, and I think those people, that are deep inside and don't know, they need human mind, works, and so, it's, it's, it's, you have to deliver benefits, and you can think of the wonders of our constitution, and it's obviously correct, and, you know, I kind of see it that way, but I think, for the outside perspective, it's much more like a backdrop protection against a regression into non-working things, the positive thing was not the American spirit or constitution to them, but it was, our standard of living was better, our quality of living was better, we didn't have horse, people were happier and wealthier, and then I tend to think a lot of these things come down to, you know, if you want to make people believe in whatever you want, whatever you want to, a constitution order, that constitutional order, that better deliver value, and I would say, you know, get to the A, I think, that one of my biggest grissisms of the elite educational institutions I went to is, that best is a dogma, but you're not delivering a country that's safe, where there's a future that's could be better than the past, that can even define itself as a country where basic things like being legal or illegal or viewed as taboo subjects, don't be surprised when people get off the ship and say, I'm not into this, and that will happen here, it will happen everywhere, and then the A.I version of it, I would say, is, first of all, on the military side, we have no choice, we cannot slip down, we have no other adversaries, we're not going to slip down, we have an advantage, and the way of all the way to dominance, and the dominance that they own pose, we want to like it, it's because, you know, we got, you know, we got people to adopt the American way, probably speaking, because we were exporting well being, and we had the bomb, and if we insert like A.I. will allow us to raise the G.E.P. of America dramatically, and help our allies do it while essentially creating the functional level of a nuclear bomb before our adversaries, and then you do have an issue of how to regulate it, and that's a very complicated issue, my version of it, it should be thresholded with like teams that kick in, depending at the level of like, it's closing, the closure gets A.I. and honestly, I don't think China or Russia, or anyone want complete A.I. and then you have the issue of course of like, who's running these companies, and you know, do you trust them? Because a lot of these technologies are quite dangerous, even what we're doing, and like, you know, if the person has a, you know, a history of being completely untrustworthy, maybe that's a problem, we're not alike with America, and those are very hard questions, I don't have any answer for it because none of us want government intervention, partly because we haven't seen a record of those people being competent enough on technical decisions, but, and because of rampant politicization of every issue, but there's still going to be very big issues. I realize our technologies, but different, given the senior in, again, they don't ask to just look around the world at the most, but, do you see potential threat upside in the Middle East? We've opened up the Dell side there, for the less, 30 or 40 years, and terrified of it. I think we can all still see it's a lot better, and we can see things that come wrong, and so some government won't put what I've been saying to us, here are the things that could actually go right there. Well, you know, I mean, I'm talking to these three people now, and the US is ridiculously pro-Israel, and I'm proud of that. But, I do think the fact it's been a long time since the Western government won a war dramatically, and we need to take heed of the law, how did they win, why did they win, and what does it mean? So, it's not even because I spent a lot of my life, we have a large, very large clients in the Arab-speaking world, and I built that business, and a lot of you learn a lot, especially I dealt with very powerful people, and very non-powerful people. And winning is what people care about, and I'm here, but I never, I never told people, but the fact I was always very open, that I was looking for a big pro-Israel. I didn't, certainly, private everyone, people, especially appreciated the honesty. And it means a lot to the forces of God over there that Israel is doing very well, and I can see, I can see it very diminished, Iran, I mean they're already very diminished. And I feel like you have the impression that every smart person is working for Israel, you can take their smart person. And the thing we just, we've got to get past, whether it's the bush version, they're going to be both Sony and Democrats, or the Obama version, that the partisan laws love us. We just have to pass this stuff to middle east people, middle east, understand, and manage that vision a lot better than we do. And I can see if we're willing to, I'm super, we have to focus on our own morality, but it's barely working here, I don't think we should be exporting all our standards, and they really have an idea. And that's that stuff. And we might see, we might see a lot of goodness. I'm very low in the US, and I can see that we're doing much better than people, people expect. And certainly, I think they're hopeful. Sony was on the agenda to feeling that every Gulf state was putting for Israel to post some assumptions kind of, because it's their fault and the law I know of this is willing. I mean, if you, one of the coolest things about my business is idea with important and unimportant people, the unimportant people being very important for what they're doing, but now I've spent a lot of time in the Arab and Middle East and lighting. Obviously, they're varying opinions, but they very much were rooting for Israel to win. But I think it's important also for just the West to general, and if you look, and you know, you spend every week in the world trying to explain to the world why they're bad, they're largely, as a proxy indicator, I don't mean one-to-one. People doing that are mostly running failed institutions and failed countries, and the Arab Middle East is not interested in that kind of failure. They're run by competent people that want success for their country. They're not interested in being told they're morally superior from the birth, player, or Yale faculty, while running an institution that barely works, that subsidized by every, still doesn't work. Despite the fact that it's tax exempt and subsidized by the US government, and so I was like, they're just not interested in that. And by the way, they think people talk like that or go, which is, like, a game isn't a game, which is why we have a successful business. They're the product plus, now they're not interested in being, they're very smart people. All of us want to watch your human history just go up to fail them. They've got these shirts out, they think we all know the reason. But there's the Middle East version, and then it is very important that people who are smart and have integrity and are willing to fight with. And, you know, it's like, and as a part of now, it's super important to stand up. You know, it starts with Fudzee, Fudzee, you know, Pagan religion, protesting in front of everything, where people are just trying to go to school and were protesting against Israel or not having an interest in defending the US. And it ends with people justifying murder or grantees. They're completely linked, and that's why you just have to stand up and fight the stuff. And in every turn, when people are asking you to get money, they're playing Fudzee with our destruction. And there is no alternative to America in the world. It's like, it is the only thing that works at the scale. It's the only place where people actually are marriage-ocratic and fair. It's the only place where they don't steal your job, or after you make it in general. It's the only place, if you want to take classic progressive lines, where we integrate people from all backgrounds. You have to do it gleefully. There's only one place like this, and the people who are yours to be yours, and they begin with one issue in the protest. The size is two. I mean, if you look at people on TV, whatever you think about our health system, you have people on TV joyously pardoning the guy who is assassinated on the streets. And these people are just going around, and we shouldn't either. I think we're out of time. Questions from the audience? Alex, Ron and Matey from Tumet. I think it was my first external investors, and I've been following you for quite some time. So you talk about your view on the evolution of the military, not only with an ex 15 to 20 years, but over the next three to five years. I'd love to hear what so many conflicts in the world going on, and with which you've empowered. Our army and our defense, like what happens with an ex three to five years away from the much longer term picture? Well, if you look at what happened in Ukraine, recently the Russians integrated jamming devices, and it went from a classic hardware large object or to a small object or powered by software, with varying weak iterations, where the products that were, especially the art were products that were useful last week aren't useful this week. And that's just going to go across every institution and defense world. So you're going to move from large to small hardware to software, hardware is going to become the powered more by the American context. You're going to have to start showing this software works, that the hardware works. And this is going to just accelerate, and that's going to happen over the next 18 months. I think some of it depends on what level of threat there is. But how does the army, how do all the joint forces do that without the technology community side by side with them, unless they're recruiting all the technologists to quickly enter? Well, there's going to be some of that. But I mean the short answer is yes, they're going to have to do that. But then productized things have to be productized, so if a piece of software is productized, the final mile does not have to be done by somebody who is usually technical. Can be done by, you know, I mean like our product is used by people who are smarter with high school degrees, people who went to MIT. And it really comes down to how good is the product, the floor is installed. And you can productize a lot of things that in the past were required technical down, many you could sell 200 people. A lot of the things they need exist in the commercial community are already existing in the battlefield, quite frankly, a big issue for the US military and other militaries is just buying the stuff they know that works instead of the stuff that they know doesn't work. So a lot of it's just contractual, like they're very basic things that would transform America, like there's something called a commercial preference meaning. I mean it's obvious to any commercial entity I offer you the cup. And this is sold at Walmart for a dollar. He offers you a cup and it's sold. It's handled here and it's built for a thousand dollars. But without a commercial preference, you might be buying this in the US government. And so a lot of it comes down to, not running around Congress all the time saying, move the budget to, and now I say more, but at the beginning it was like we need 1% 0.2% of the US budget goes to defense budget 0.2%. And if you said 1% goes to products that are software that if you've been used on the battlefield effectively, a third party validation and the roof and sold commercially, it's probably in the 2% reach. And so that has to change to like 20%. And these things will, I mean they're going to do it. And the way you're thinking this happening now is when you talk to senators, congressmen, generals, everyone is saying the same thing. And then you, to your point, you do have an influx of people that want to help the US government over very technical. But it is a combination of pressure from the top internally, pressure from our adversaries, budgetary pressure and productization. And there's a huge difference now, again with these, I'm not trying to hear to sell my product. What would have taken us, we had this deployment with a very large retail company and we did the same thing two years ago. It took us six months now. And that would just, we know it's a lot of life for the customer, but not enough to really force the CEO to engage them into six days. These things are like, you know, it's like you can take large language models. So, large language models, as you may have noticed or a science experiment for you that you're paying for because you have a board they've told you it's important. But you can actually manage them so that they're before targeting like, where does the drone go? How does the drone get there? Who just the drone kill? Like for example, if you're Ukrainian, you want to kill this smart unpopular general, not the eating popular general. But you said there's a lot of, a lot of thought goes into taking people out to kill the person near hospital. And do you kill them near school? Is someone in the car? Especially you let's start getting, there's a lot of things embedded into how this happens. And that's complicated technically because, say, you know, you guys are a car and you are in the terrace, you're going after, but actually your phone is compromised and because of your phone we know everything is happening. But that can't go into the overt targeting package because most people in the room don't know your phone is compromised. It's a very complex technical thing, but you can do the lower end version, which is what the fans did, pretty, with the hints and the stuff within weeks. And that stuff, then it actually, the other thing to your fans have done, which is not sensitive, but there's something you take in software called branching, which means you can, but you can do things at different parts of the software without sharing. So let's say, something in investment, ideas, stands, managing five people. One of them is really the best at making a lot of money, but also the best at losing it. So how do you control where they experiment, how much they invest, what rights they have to invest, what rights they have to not invest, what is the asset class they can invest in, what asset class can be not invested. So if you don't have to get authorization from STEM, this is exactly what happens with Battlefield. But if you have the branching, if you have branching, technology like that, you can also invest it. So let's just say you think your general is an idiot, and you actually know what's going on, and your technical, they're not, you can often get battle plans to work, that meaning they wouldn't have exactly understood. So there's these things actually are available, and I think because they're available now in a way they weren't, they get adopted because it used to be in the past. It was very, I mean what happened was everybody in government, and sometimes companies will say sure we'll do that, but the bureaucracy can slow you down to the point where it wasn't clear, the alpha was great enough for engagement. But now it's just, the alpha is great enough so that you won't overwhelm you. And you just need less technical talent also because the large language models allow you to augment the technical talent that the people you have, who are not technical. And retain their knowledge, which tends to be a big issue in US fighting and industrial US government, and companies because you have US as a transient workforce unlike say Germany. And Japan, so managing a transient workforce is difficult where you have technical specializations. Thank you. And I would like to thank you for helping the good guys who helped me record more and do it in the future. And thanks for helping me, and I wish you have a good day.
