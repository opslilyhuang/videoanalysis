Please welcome corporate executive 
officer, corporate vice president, COO in charge of solution services and head of 
global solutions at Fujitsu, Yoshinami Takahashi. [Music] Uh hi everyone. Uh my name is Takashi 
from Fujitsu. Um basically I want to talk about what we do with Palantia um in Japan. not only in 
Japan but also like um across the globe we work with trying to uh provide transformation to all 
the industry countries. So Fujitsu is a Japanese one of the largest tech company. We focus we built 
like a supercomputer a quantum computing not not air conditioning by the way. Um we're known we're 
like a big one of the largest system integrator. We focus on the mission critical either it 
may be healthcare like a finance but this is very important. So uh through our global brand 
called Fujitsu Yubas, we're committed to kind of solve the society issues and again turning 
data in AI into better decisions and real world outcomes. This is very important. So again with 
Palantia we focus on the mission critical again very critical to Japanese competitiveness. So we 
focus again in like uh enterprise customers but like a manufacturing, automotive, energy and also 
like uh healthcare and these are really important. So this uh many of these sectors do face a lot of 
change challenges not only unique to Japan but I'm sure all these multinational companies outside of 
Japan do face similar kind of um problems like in Japan by 2045 there's like a reduction of labor 
force by almost 30 30%. That's a big number. So we're going to face shortage of labor as you know 
we have an earthquake in Japan. So that's pretty immense what's happening in the earthquake all 
the geopolitical issues that's happening across the globe that's another issue. So in this kind of 
uncertainty we are leveraging Palantius technology and also Fujitsu's technology to kind of mitigate 
all the risk. Uh since um how to say uh also one more point this is very important uh we've been 
using palantia for almost five years. So we have like a 60 siloed system in Fujitsu. So we all 
integrated the data through ontology making sure we can make a right decision a global deci making 
a right decision for business. So this type of practice internal practice we take to our customer 
as a firsthand experience. This is very important. So last year in 2024 AIPCON my colleague has 
talked about like the supply chain. So this year we have moved this dynamic supply chain 
management oper operating system using embedded AI more into like advanced level. So what I want 
to show you today is a live demonstration of what we have right now and also what is coming up with 
the new uh AI agents. So this is kind of a typical uh example of like a Japanese global manufacturer. 
They have like a 3,000 suppliers, 18 factories, scattered system around 20. So they have obviously 
issue around data fragmentation 200,000 SKU. So basically the company was struggling with the 
inventory management. So what we did is basically um in two weeks with Panantia without shutting 
down the existing uh system we built this global supply chain system and also made the data into uh 
visi visible so that the company can engage into the transformation. So now they almost manage two 
million parts simultaneously with Palantia Foundry with our AI platform Kosichi again auto machine 
learning we built a connected supply chain system with 30 integrated application across inventory 
forecasting and production and planning. So in just two months kosuchi is again auto machine 
learning the we built like a 300 demand prediction for 300 SKUs. Because of this the company was able 
to reduce the labor force by 50%. And now they have this annual cost saving of over $10 million. 
So how is this basically possible is again uh this we did not base it on a single application 
not a dashboard but also like this is like a truly integrated dynam dynamic supply chain management 
operating system. Again we think um uh solving this kind of a impact in societ um in resolving 
this social issues but also business issue is very important. So let me kind of show you how this 
is in placed in action. So when we talk about the dynamic supply chain management operating system, 
we do not mean just like a visibility. It's about how much the company can take quick actions 
making or like a taking every um decisions in a right timing. Address the risk before it happens 
across like a production, logistics and customer and consumers. Again the inventory control many of 
the large Japanese companies still use spreadsheet which is again an issue. So with this uh operating 
system the entire process is automated all the supply chain data flows into one connected 
environment optimizing operations cutting cost and also maintaining resilience. This is kind 
of very important and today this automation is evolving further with AI agents. When a shortage 
risk appears, specialized agent for procurement, inventory and sales each will be proposing a 
solution. An orchestration a agent will kind of select the best option and an evaluator agent will 
validate the option. Then the human beings upon necessity they will make decision collaboratory 
with the AI agent. So again we think dynamic supply chain like a 90 more than 95% of the task 
should be automated. So this is not really in theory but it's in practice right now with this 
Japanese large companies right now in Japan. Uh this capability and speed are only possible 
because it's not a single application but a fabric of over 30 interconnected applications 
built on the same business ontology. Once the ontology allows every new 
application to reinforce for the others, accelerating development and creating a shared 
foundation where AI agents and human operators collaborate seamlessly and result is not uh 
just efficiency but also the resilience. So as you as I kind of may maybe mentioned before 
like Japan is like a country of earthquake. So when not earthquake hit u uh in January of 2024 
this company was able to kind of uh mitigate the all the risks associated with supply chain. So 
within like one day they were able to kind of define what is the possible impact and they they 
made a decision to reroot kind of change supply on the spot. Usually it took like almost like a 
four to like seven days. But through this kind of ontology data integration and and leveraging 
the AI they were able to do to to do this type of um um crisis management. So again the true 
supply chain we think it's like it's it needs to be like a connected intelligent and ready 
for both daily decisions and crisis response. So building on that same foundation, we are 
now taking it to the next level, embedding AI agents directly into disaster response. The 
real the reality is that this operating system operating system not only works in the business 
as usual, this is not enough. So in the modern uh global supply chain, we believe it needs to 
withstand variety of shocks. So again earthquakes or like a tsunami or like a supplier failure or 
even like a geopolitical dis disruption that can break all the continuity with the business. So 
together with palantia we developed this agents to handle these complex scenarios. For example a 
disaster response agent for large scale earthquake earthquakes in Japan where like a magnitude 8 is 
expected in next few decades. we have to be kind of prepared for this type of uh uh incidents. 
So this agent will be managing uh disruption, simulating potential facility damage, assessing 
inventory impact and also highlighting weak points across the supply chain. So again supporting 
not the day-to-day usage only but when at the time of crisis how fast we can respond to this 
type of um uh incidents. This is very important. Uh another point is again um because our ontology 
AIP and AI agents are unified on one platform. The agent not only explains why they have made 
that options but also turns this into the live execution moving operators from insight to actions 
instantly with confidence. This is very important. So again uh one example around this is the like a 
principle applies not only across like a a single task but like a procurement production sales and 
intercon connected of connect connectivity of AI agents embedded directly into the operation. 
So as I as I have mentioned the AI agent will be developed and it's going to learn what how to 
mitigate more risk in a more clever way. We think this is uh very important moving forward. So then 
the next step is going to be how do we train and evolve the AI agents. So this is kind of a very 
famous icon that we have made. So we have this uh very domain specific agents working across 
multiple task. So the uh rapid development of a AI agent not is possible but practical practical at 
scale. This is very important. So each time that uh the agents face a disruption or unusual case 
they learn from the feedback from human beings and then based on their proposal the human beings 
will be feeding back was that the right decision was that effective decision and also validation 
agent will be teaching all the uh co u domain specific agent you could have maybe made a 
different decision or option. So I think this type of enterprise feedback loop with the data and 
interaction between human beings that will be kind of educating all the agents again auto machine 
learning this type of technology will also support the agents learn quickly about the uh incidents. 
So more and more we think the agent itself is going to be automated as we kind of leverage 
this type of agents across multiple cases. So one of the key element is that the AI agent 
is going to be is going is going to grow like a newborn to a very skilled professionals over time. 
So again they do not learn like a task by the explicit rules but also by subtle decision making 
that is unique to each company and because this uh capability is embedded in the operating 
system. It scales allowing organization to continuously advance the dynamic supply 
chain shared by their own expertise. So um this type of like u the agent learning 
from each other being educated as a skilled worker we think there's going to be a 
rapid development of AI agents in this uh segment. Uh our vision with palante goes beyond 
this single case. We think this AI agent is going to reside in a single usage for a moment like 
within a company. But over time the agent will talk to each other with a cross company and 
that will kind of give more impact resolving many of the society issues. Again imagine one of 
the manufacturers of all the suppliers sharing data they can uh they can all basically manage 
the disruption in a more managed way. Imagine this agent is talking into cross industry 
for like a energy company. How to kind of um ensure that the electricity is u provided to 
the needed factory. So when the data is shared we think we can provide much more biggest 
resilience to the society itself. So our vision is to kind of leverage technology again 
palantia and fujitsu coming together to kind of u to make sure we have a very robust uh system in 
the Japan society. But we basically want to kind of provide this type of solution across the uh not 
only in Japan but also across the global market. So that is uh my presentation today and thank you 
very much for the attention. Thank you so much.
