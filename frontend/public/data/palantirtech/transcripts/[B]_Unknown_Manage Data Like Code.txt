TRANSCRIPT

Like really what it is is creating a unified view over lots of disparate data sources, which don't otherwise make sense together. As we started working on a big data platform, we thought, well, okay, it's obvious we have to version our logic. We need to sort of remember how do we transform the data over time, how do we get to this particular result. One thing that we didn't expect when we first started out is that we also had a version of the data. And so one of the things that's kind of interesting, especially in the commercial world, is the data is constantly evolving. It's not just changing in terms of content, it's changing in terms of shape. And being able to look back and time and sort of figure out where did you come from, not only is it helped tell the story of how did you get here, but it also helps you understand the decisions that were made along the way. It's the ultimate version of show your work. You can imagine like taking a math exam and you're not just writing down like all the equations, you're writing down the number, the number results in between. And it's much easier to sort of figure out your journey if you can actually see that whole process. We try to embody this idea of developing trust. And we do that through versioning and problems. Being able to trust your data is in part knowing where it came from, but then also being able to have everything that's necessary to make the highest quality decision. In order to do that, we have to have security. And it has to be built in from the beginning, trying to bolt on security after the fact to any enterprise application in reality is extremely hard. What we're assuring is whenever you actually need some information, not only are you trusting the results, but the people who are contributing that data, those people can actually trust that the platform will hold and protect that data in a reasonable way and protect it for the right use cases. You know, it's pretty hard to build a data platform where like security and versioning are the core concepts. And it's even harder to build a platform where all of these things kind of work together across the spectrum of tools. So I think there's certainly people out there building a really great analysis tool, like a really great kind of table query tool, a really great charting tool. I think there are not so many people out there building something that's like fully integrated in terms of enterprise security and data management and actually like understanding how the data flows through the system. And I think people forget, well, how do I know it worked? And if you think about it, like actually what Pounder really does for people is they help answer the question, not just what should I do and not just, okay, help you do it, we actually help people answer, well, did it work? You know, I wanted this to change, did it actually change? And that's like, I think that's the big thing. It's taking software engineering practices and software engineering theories, things like I should version and I should propose changes rather than just making them directly. And I should be able to do that in a fast iterative way with metrics. Like, if I think about those things, what we're really saying is Pounder brings software engineering concepts, brings programming concepts to data.
