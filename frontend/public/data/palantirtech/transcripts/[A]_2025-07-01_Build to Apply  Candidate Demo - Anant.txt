TRANSCRIPT

Hi, Palantir. I'm Anant, a software engineering student passionate about solving real-world problems using technology. You've probably heard of 311. It's a reporting system used across North America for non-emergency municipal issues ranging from noise complaints to broken infrastructure. These systems are crucial but are often overwhelmed by high-request volumes and poor operational coordination. In Toronto alone, over 463,000 service requests were submitted in 2024. And at this scale, smart triage and planning are essential for timely resolution. But many Toronto residents, including myself, have experienced months of delays caused by poor planning and prioritization. So how do we fix this? That's where Palantir's Foundry and AIP come in. Using these tools, I built 311 AI, an AI-powered platform that intelligently prioritizes and manages 311 service requests, supporting dispatchers and field crews from start to finish. Dispatchers get a real-time holistic view of active requests across Toronto's 25 wards. With a heat map and built-in filters for request type, severity and date, they can quickly narrow their focus and act faster. Each request has an AI-generated severity score based on its full context, helping teams take faster and smarter action. Clicking into a request opens its full details, including its severity, precise location and how long it's been open. At the bottom, a dispatcher can assign a specific eligible crew to handle the task. This makes it easy to go from understanding a request to taking immediate action. But instead of looking at one request at a time, dispatchers can head to the AI priority view where all open service requests have been ranked based on urgency. This ranking is powered by an AIP logic function that analyzes severity scores, days open and request context to produce a linear, unambiguous priority list. This gives the city a bird's eye view of what needs to be handled first, ensuring no time is wasted on low impact work. Each ranking includes an AI-generated rationale to help dispatchers understand the prioritization and make informed decisions. 311 AI also uses AIP to automatically generate a daily plan for each crew, tailored to their service department and capacity. Here on the Smart Assign page, dispatchers can review these AI-generated plans, which strategically group tasks based on severity, timing and geographic proximity. Dispatchers can then accept a plan to assign the crew tasks, reject it, or modify it to better fit operational needs, enabling human discretion alongside AI efficiency. When modifying a crew plan, all assigned requests are on the left, and on the right is an AIP-powered chatbot interface. It understands the full context of active requests and the current plan, including priority, workload and task constraints. So dispatchers can simply describe how they want to modify the crew's plan and let the AI handle the execution. For example, I can say replace the second task with one that's closer to the rest, and the assistant will automatically revise the plan. This allows dispatchers to spend less time managing individual schedules and more time focusing on higher-level decision making. Once plans are finalized, field crews can log into the platform to view the assigned tasks. When on-site, they can view full task details, update the request status, and submit comments or media like photos of the work completed. This creates a direct feedback loop between the field and dispatch, ensuring every task is transparently tracked and documented. It brings structure and accountability to city operations, while giving teams the tools they need to resolve issues efficiently. 311AI helps dispatchers prioritize smarter, crews execute more efficiently, and ensures that critical public issues don't fall through the cracks. While this project was developed using a subset of real Toronto data, the solution is scalable to any major city from New York to San Francisco, where thousands of service requests are filed daily. With Palantir Foundry and AIP, we can empower cities to fix problems faster and make public services truly responsive.
