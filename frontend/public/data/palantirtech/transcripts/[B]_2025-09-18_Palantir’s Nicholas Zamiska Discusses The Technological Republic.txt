TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Well, the the the core argument of the book is 
that Silicon Valley should come to the defense of the nation that made its rise possible. You know, 
I came of age during a generation where there was so much talent, so much funding really flowing 
to Silicon Valley. But to build the trivial and ephemeral, you know, the iPhones that are in all 
of our pockets, it's a wondrous invention. It's changed our lives. You know, we use the apps. Um, 
but is that the is that the best we can do? Is that the crowning achievement of our civilization? 
Shouldn't we be directing more energy, more time, more heart, more money to the things that 
really will move the needle? You know, we're involved with counterterrorism, national security, 
medical research, industrial production. You know, how can we convince people to spend their effort 
and resources, scarce as they are, to what really matters? Um, I would also say I think you know in 
some ways we take for granted the relative period of not peace but geopolitical stability. It's 
September 2025 essentially 80 years since the last time a nuclear weapon was used in war in Japan of 
August of 1945. You know, we read the headlines, we feel the conflict, you know, horrors and 
uh and tragedy across the world, but we have essentially lived through a very remarkable 
period of, I would argue, geopolitical stasis, if not peace, some degree of stalemate. There has 
not been a great powers conflict for near nearly a century. Yes, it feels like we always might be 
on the verge of it. But I do think that we in the United States and more broadly with our allies 
including Germany of course and NATO and Europe um should not take for granted the extent to 
which investment in defense, intelligence, counterterrorism, software, AI for the battlefield 
has helped facilitate a remarkable period of peace. Billions of people and their children and 
their grandchildren have now never known a world war. We should not take that for granted. 
We should be humble in our aspirations. But uh I think we should make sure we're dedicating 
our resources where it matters most. How do you manage the distributional and equitable outcomes 
of the technology come back to the center stage? Right. Um with the people that have the technology 
in their hands right now. Absolutely. And and there are risks. I think we've never denied that 
there are risks and excesses uh and and potential challenges. I do think we need to think about risk 
in the context of what we're trying to achieve. So, you know, in the context of the consumer 
internet or the apps again that really have dominated this first era of innovation, you 
know, I'm much less interested in taking on risk, but when it comes to counterterrorism, and our 
company has certainly been involved in preventing terror attacks, preventing bombs from going off, 
uh, you know, my risk appetite increases in the context of medical research, oncology, you know, 
you know, I'm I'm willing to take on much more uh much more uncertainty in search of 
those outcomes. Absolutely. I also think that although we should be at times skeptical 
and cautious in adopting these technologies, um we need to be more voracious in our appetite in 
terms of incorporating the culture that has been the precursor to the construction of this software 
into government. You know, I think about something like the F-35 joint strike fighter. This is the 
premier jet of our time, conceived of in the mid 1990s under President Clinton. A real market 
now with the allies in NATO and elsewhere. Um this and Mark Millie reminded us of this uh you 
know this jet will cost essentially$ two trillion dollars. Uh its end of useful life will be 2088. 
You know this is almost a century for one product. This is completely alien and foreign to us in 
the valley. You know that long of an iteration cycle. Um what are the odds as Mark Millie said? 
What are the odds that a man strike fighter is winning the skies in 2088? I think all of us 
in this room know the answer to that question. Uh so when it comes to you know medical research 
or national security or counterterrorism, local law enforcement, education, public health, 
um how can we shorten those iteration cycles from a century to 50 years to 25 to two years to two 
months and and co-opt some of that energy and dynamism and that the private sector is expert 
at certainly and bring that into government. I think that's the hope because Palanteer is 
really at the core of national security topic and counterterrorism and and is a very data design 
company. What would when you look at Europe today uh what do you think should be our priorities 
um to make sure that we infuse this uh spirit of disruption at a time when we need to be really I 
would say meeting with our moment in history in a way. Absolutely. Spending is part of it. Money is 
part of it. There's no doubt about it. You know, the US has been spending 3 to 5% of its GDP on 
national security for decades now. After 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, we all know that 
Europe retreated to some degree uh from its investment in defense. Um but these these uh you 
know, maybe 1.5% creeping up um as I think we all agree that it should. Uh but those small deltas 
in uh amounts spent on defense compound over time. you know, we all know about investing two 3% 
these small differences make an absolute have an absolute impact um over time. So money is 
part of it, but I also think to your question the there's a more sort of cultural uh sort of 
inquiry that's necessary as well and it's about risk and it's about what incentives we set for our 
leaders. In the book, you know, we write about a very senior admiral in the US Navy named Hyman 
Rickover. Uh some of you may of course know him. Um, Jimmy Carter served under him, former US 
president. Uh, he was an irassable fellow. Uh, kind of abusive, I think would be the technical 
term by contemporary standards. Made junior officers stand in a closet, yelled at them, 
bered them. I think in a 1984 interview with Diane Sory or he had kind of some degree of 
uh self-awareness. He said that, you know, I have I have the charisma of a chipmunk. So, he 
knew he was a little bit of a pill, right? Um, and yet he was the father of the nuclear navy by 
no uncertain terms. Uh, he helped take Oenheimer's invention, the nuclear reactor, Oenheimer and 
others, um, uh, from the ' 40s and shrunk it into something smaller, a nuclear reactor that 
could fit on a submarine. So now submarines could not just remain submerged for days but 
weeks and months uh and gave the US and its allies around the world I think uh an a decisive 
advantage over the oceans that persist to this day and yet you know he had enemies I guess you know 
hopefully we don't have too enemies everyone has some probably but uh he definitely had enemies 
and and they they saw him in him I think some degree of vanity and excess certainly and perhaps 
pride. So, in the early 1980s, it came out that he had been accepting gifts from uh General Dynamics, 
which was and is or certainly was the premier ship builder of the time. But the roster of gifts 
was sort of odd and eclectic. It was kind of uh cutlery and dry cleaning for his suits 
and a necklace for his wife, right? You know, um betraying, I think, a significant degree degree 
of vanity and and perhaps pride. And he thought he was above the rules, but this comes out, you know, 
front page of the Times, the usual thing. and he's he's skewered and this is his fall from grace. Um 
and and yet is there no place for forgiveness? Is there no place for tolerance of the you know the 
contradictions and of the human psyche of the human mind? Uh no place to allow our leaders whose 
intentions are aligned with our own and intentions are noble enough for some degree of error. Um and 
I think stories like this and we all know many uh are are vital to understanding what incentives 
we are setting for leaders in the in the US we have plenty of challenges but certainly in 
Silicon Valley and at the company I work for um there is a significant degree of tolerance 
for the complexity of the human mind and as long as you're noble enough and striving in the 
right direction and building something of use to both yourselves certainly but more importantly 
the public um a degree of tolerance for error I think is vital um you know we have this aspect 
ation for our public servants to be our priests but that may be uh counterproductive in certain 
context. I hope that is responsible. How do you assess the the positioning when you say the west 
and the values and some and and the alliances? Who is then the non-west and how do we uh engage 
not engage um uh work with them or against them? what is the safety distance that you see towards 
the rest of the world right in a very globalized world. So well it's exactly the right question and 
we're at time so I'll just finish up briefly. Um you know the engagement is vital but I do think we 
had this fantasy that some civilian technologies would not necessarily have dual uses. I think 
that is a fantasy that's being unwound. I think we should be skeptical to our partners. Always 
seek peace, invest for defense for the purpose of preventing a war, not fighting one. Um but I 
do think the US still has a tremendous advantage and again if you approach it with humility 
uh that advantage can and should be retained.
