Please welcome Chief Information Officer at Fouvier, Eric Godard. Hello, I'm Eric Godard, I'm the CEO of Fouvier, so I'm very happy being with you today. I will try to tell you a bit more about that, a journey for tier 1 in the automotive business. But before telling, speaking about data, I would like to give you a few words about what is Fouvier, because probably most of you don't know what is Fouvier. So basically the former name was Fouvier, for Asia, and now we are thanks to the acquisition of 80 plus percent of Hela, we have a new name, which is Fouvier, and we are basically a tier 1 in the automotive business. We have, let's say, big customers, and of course, Alexander BMW is one of them. We have more than 300 sites, 150,000 employees, 35,000 engineers, let's say, lots of R&D centers, so you can see the figures, and obviously with all of that, we are creating lots of data. What do we produce? Basically, we have six business groups. We are producing seats, and we will not go through all the details, you will see the figures there. We are producing all what is linked to interior system, basically cockpits, door panel, etc. We are producing, we have a business group which is clean mobility, clean mobility being all the exhaust system, but as well, lots of products around hydrogen, hydrogen tanks, etc. And now thanks to the acquisition of first Clion Electronic, and then Hela, we are, let's say, developing electronic, very specific electronic components, and as well lighting. Last but not least, we have a business group for life cycle solutions, after sales, market, etc. So this is for, let's say, for VR. Basically, we have a mission, and we like this world, we say we pioneer technology for mobility experiences that matter to people. And basically, we are in a world which is changing drastically. And I will now give you the vision of this Palantir, this data approach, let's say, with the CIO eyes, which is sometimes a bit different than some other colleagues. So definitely, our CIO role is changing drastically. I take some example of those changes. We are in a world where the IT architecture with a single big ERP, able to deliver everything, is no longer possible. It will require much more flexibility, much more agility. One point we need to highlight is the fact that we, and this has been already addressed this morning by some colleagues, we are no more dealing only with internal data. We are dealing with an extended company model, and we have for sure to take into account data from suppliers, customers, partners, etc. And this will become more and more the case. This is absolutely clear. The point as well, and this is the IT view, is that thanks to all those new systems, all the digitalization, the way we address the IT budget is a bit more mature. For sure, we are still fighting with cost, we are in the automotive business. But all in all, we speak much, much more about value creation. And this is very interesting for all of us. The very important topic is the fact that a single team will never be in a position to create all the value which is needed. And this is clearly where entering in the world of what I call data democratization. And let's say a team of experts developing report, developing analytics, this is over. For sure, we will still need that, but we need much, much more than this. And thanks to the fact, due to the fact that everybody will use those tools for sure, the user experience is more than ever important, but this is a kind of obvious. Basically to summarize, we are in a situation where IT is moving from a kind of support function role to a real business partner role. And this is really very exciting for all of us, for sure. Now, let's jump in the data, data value acceleration program of four via. We have three pillars. The first one being what we call the hardware digital productivity. So basically, this is all linked to automation, what is linked to automation, AGV robots, etc. including the connectivity. The second one being what we call automated decision making. And this is, we put inside there all the manufacturing execution system, all the shop floor tools, digitalization at the shop floor level, new cockpit, new whatever, etc. And the last one, and this is the one we will highlight a bit more today, is what we call the data driven business productivity. So this is basically all the value that we can create towards the data collection and all the, let's say, usage of data that we can leverage. And so basically we have those three pillars. So we for this, buzz is slide, I will go very fast on it, but this is just wanted to show you the architecture, because I was explaining that the architecture is changing. And basically this is the four via the four Seattle for via landscape. So on the on the left side, you have the, what we call central data center, basically all the standard tool we all of us have, stand at EAP, PLM, etc. This is still on prem. We are moving more and more towards cloud application. And this is already part of the modularity I was highlighting. So basically we decrease the size of the core system in order to leverage plenty of very, let's say, more easy to use tools around SAS tools, whatever the tools are. And we have as well what we call the distributed IT, which is very important in a company where we have 250, 300 plants. Obviously we have lots of MES manufacturing manufacturing execution solution at the level of the plant. So basically we have plenty of different solution already. So for this in order to leverage all of that, we need a data platform obviously. And historically we had already the business intelligence, more or less everybody has it. We were mainly producing to be honest out of this business intelligence report out of SAP. And this is this was absolutely not enough. This is not enough anymore. That's why we decided to move towards a big data approach in order to make sure that we are able to collect all the data coming from all those different system. Plus by the way, some from the external that's from external databases. And the advantage, the reason why we took parents is the global integration because we are able to not only to collect the data, but as well to prepare those data, to transform those data, to create the famous ontology in order to make sure that we jump into the democratization. So this is basically the architecture we put in place. We made that decision a bit less than two years ago to move to we started with a bit less than two years ago. Then what where we are today after let's say 20 20 plus months. So I will not detail of that for sure, but you see that we have already 35 sources connected, which is quite a lot because the sources can be big. SAP for instance is one source is a P.L.M. is another source is so we have 35 plus and this is increasing, I would say almost every week. We started in a kind of big environment, still not yet where we want to go, but we have 90 to work. So basically we are in a situation where creating, let's say, value from the data use cases is really possible and was really possible. I will come back to that just after. Just before finishing with where we are, what did we achieve? I like to highlight very quickly some challenges. It's a kind of abuse to be honest. But the one I would like to highlight is probably the availability of the business experts. Because this is really very important. So whatever the nice tool we put in place, if we don't have the right business experts to define where we want to go, what kind of value we want to create, we want to generate, this is very difficult. So this is key, it's not only an IT tool, it's not magic, it works very well, but it's not magic. So basically I'd like to finish with the benefit where we are after those 20 plus months of less experience with Palantir. Which is clear that now we have a full data integration across an extended company because we use for the automotive business, for instance, everybody knows the IHS database. Well, we have all the forecasts and so on. For sure, all of that is integrated. We start having value, a producing operational use cases. And basically we've been able, I will come back to this, but to go with a ramp up approach and to produce use cases quite fast in order to create the savings immediately. Because otherwise if you go for a very long period, when you say, okay, I will create the savings in two years, for sure it doesn't work anymore. We need to show that it works faster than this. So before jumping on the coming back to the use case, I'd like to speak a bit because I'm still an IT guy. I'd like to speak a bit about the foundation. And basically it works well, but for sure we need a bit of IT guys around this in order to secure. And I give you the figures there, rough figures. Basically you show that you see that we implemented a team quite small, not that big team, it's between 15, 20, to give you a range of ID. But this is representing around 1% of the staff of the global CIO organization. But this is important. We need them for infrastructure. We need them for security obviously. This is key. We don't need a lot. You see, we just use an expert 10, 20% of this time. It's everything is prepared. But still, it's important to implement this, to check. As we develop lots of connectors or we reuse, let's say the connector provided by PANANTIA, we need guys to integrate all of that. We need to make sure that all of that is working smoothly and not working one shot. It must be an industrial solution. We are in the manufacturing business. Basically, we don't want only a POC. We want something that is ready to get deployed. And now that's why we have this team. So now let's speak a bit about the use case. The use case deployment. What is important for us is the word deployment. Once more, developing use case is quite easy. We can easily develop use case. We can deploy those use case within 300 sites is another challenge. And this is where we are pushing what we are pushing for. Basically, after, let's say, several months, let's say, less than six months, we were already able to deploy some use case within the 300 plants. Those were quite simple use cases using only four or five different data sources. But at least, we were able to say, OK, go ahead with this. If you use that, you will save this and that and that. Let me give you one example, quite well known in the automotive business in the manufacturing. It's the yield management, for instance. The yield management is a kind of obvious that it's very important. We are consuming lots of raw material. And this is not needed to consume more than expected. It's even, it's the pure waste of money and it's not good for our customer. Well, if we consume too much, too much material, we are just creating parts which are too heavy. This is not at all what our customer wants. We need to be at the really right level, which is very challenging. And for sure, for that kind of use case, parent is very useful. But just an example, we have plenty of use cases in purchase environment in different domain of the company, which makes the topic very interesting. And now for sure, we continue. Today, we have 100 concurrent builders, so meaning that 100 guys out of the IT organization are developing use cases, which is completely new. Before this approach, everything was developed by my team internally. And for sure, we were always bottleneck for those business intelligence reports. This is now over. We are spreading that all over the company. And then the journey is continuing. So we have 40 case use cases which are deployed right now. 700 users are using this daily. And obviously we will continue. And then we are feeding the pipe, which is very important is to make sure that we are generating new use cases on a permanent basis to continue the savings. So to conclude where we are. So we consider and this is recognized by the business that we have made lots of savings with this. Basically, if you remember my street pillars of the digital transformation, we have the automation, the, I would say the MES plus and the data. Basically, we can consider that almost 50% of the savings are generated through data. 20% through the MES part and 30% to the automation, which is a GV and so on. So 50% of the savings are created thanks to this data use those data use cases. This is very, very important. So, I have that being on top of the what I call the soft savings in terms of data quality, a silo breaking, which as a CIO, I'm fighting for years in order to explain that data quality is key. But the reality is that I've not always been successful. But now that the users are discovering themselves, our painfullities when we have wrong data in the system. This is creating a very dynamic approach in order to improve the quality. This is very, very interesting. And we bring the silo because we are able to correlate data coming from plenty of different domain, including external database, which is obviously very important. And last but not least, for for this year and for the year now, which is the most important is the Hela integration. We bought Hela a several months ago, which is a kind of big group for us. And obviously we want to create plenty of synergy. And we will not create this synergy by replacing all the back of this ERP into second. We will do that for sure. We will harmonize that. But it will take years to do so. That's why we've decided to jump immediately with parent here on the Hela side as well, in order to say, okay, with the current backbone, we'll collect all those data and we'll generate use cases, new other new use cases, or we will reuse the use case. The use case we have already with in with in forcia in order to create immediately that synergy and not waiting for the global harmonization. That's it for the journey. Thank you for your attention. That's it.
