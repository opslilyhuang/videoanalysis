[Music] Welcome to the Working Intelligence Podcast, 
part of Working Intelligence, the AI Optimism Project. I'm Jordan Hirsch, and I'm honored to 
be joined by my friend and fellow Palunteerian, Mike Gallagher. Mike spent seven years in Congress 
representing the 8th district of Wisconsin, served in the Marine Corps as an intelligence officer 
with two deployments in Iraq and holds a PhD from Georgetown. We're recording this podcast on 
the eve of the 24th anniversary of September 11th, a hinge point in our history and proving really 
that our fight was not over after the end of the Cold War. It demanded the grit and ingenuity 
of the American people to adapt and overcome. And today we stand on another hinge point facing 
new challenges from powers like China which demands every ounce of that grid and ingenuity 
supercharged by artificial intelligence. We're going to talk to Mike today about that evolution. 
Mike's really somebody who's lived that evolution from the start of the postcold war period until 
this point and talk about how American workers rose to meet the challenge of that era and how 
AI can empower them to meet the challenges that we face today. So Mike, really glad to have you 
here for this podcast and an important moment for us to to reckon with the history of 911 and 
couldn't think of anyone better to do it with. So on that note, why don't you just start by asking 
you on the 24th anniversary, what did 911 mean to you in your career? I assume it was somewhat 
formative and and perhaps the reason for your various forms of of public service, but would love 
if you could reflect a little bit on your decision to serve in the Marines and to run for Congress 
and what effect 911 had on those decisions. Well, first of all, Jordan, it's an honor to be with 
you and it's an honor to be called your friend in addition to your colleague. I've long admired your 
work and we've c before we worked together here at Palanteer, we crossed paths in various, you know, 
efforts to improve American national security. So, it's always fun to be with you. Um, I would say, 
well, first of all, it's it's crazy to think that it's 24 years ago. It does seem less far removed 
than that in my own mind. I was a senior in high school when 9/11 happened. I remember vividly, 
this was, you know, data. I'm now like old, particularly at a company like Palunteer, like, 
you know, 41 basically means you're both. Um, but this we had just like gotten big projector screens 
in the classroom which was a massive like deal uh in terms of e education technology at the time. 
And so I remember what the the plane hit the first tower while I was still at home cuz I was on the 
west coast and then when I got to zero period the second plane it hit but then I watched the towers 
crash to the ground. um in my American government class at the time, AP American Government. Um and 
I I mean obviously it was instantly palpable and clear that this was a sort of a historyaltering 
event and a incredibly somber and tragic event. That being said, it wasn't as if I immediately 
knew, oh my gosh, I have to rush out, find a Marine Corps recruiting station, put on a uniform. 
I mean, it's still I was lucky enough not to have anyone in my immediate family directly affected by 
it. Although, my brother-in-law, who was not yet engaged to my sister, was working in the Twin 
Towers on a floor above where the plane hits, but happened to sleep in that day, crazy enough. 
And there's, you know, thousands of stories like this. Um, but it still seemed like I didn't 
immediately connect the dots in terms of what was my part in the response. Obviously, it took some 
time for our country to work out um the response. It wasn't until I went to college the next year 
um and we got more wholesomely engaged in the Middle East, particularly after the invasion of 
Iraq, uh that I started to think about, okay, what are we doing? Like, what is this problem 
we're grappling with in terms of Salafi jihadists that want to kill us and destroy our way of life? 
That seems odd because we're America. We're great. We have no enemies. History had ended, etc. Um, 
and the more and I actually got so interested in that I changed my major. Uh, and I started 
studying Arabic and the Middle East. And the more I pulled that string intellectually and the 
more I learned about the region and I wrote a, um, a senior thesis examining uh, terrorist uh, 
groups and their involvement with civil society organizations, I just became fascinated by the 
Middle East. the more I started to think about, okay, maybe practically uh maybe this is an 
opportunity to use these skills and put them to use for the country and that that would be better 
for me and for the country than going to Wall Street and just like shifting numbers around on a 
spreadsheet. No offense to all my friends who did that. Uh and then secondly, you know, the country 
was at war. I didn't come from a military family, but I felt like I had had I'd been pretty lucky um 
to grow up in a you know with a lot of advantages um attend some great schools um and then I 
felt like I had a debt I needed to repay to the country and I knew I would kind of look back 
and regret it if I didn't step up and serve. Uh I'm also kind of a bit of a contrarian by 
nature and so at the time it was not fashionable if you were at an Ivy League school to join the 
military in general. Particularly by the time I went to officer candidate school this was really 
when the war started going badly uh with the Samar Mos bombing was in 2005 2006 the bottom fell 
out of the country. This was like you know the the anti-Iraq war fever started to reach a fever 
pitch. So it was kind of a contrarian move. There hadn't been we had an ROC program at Princeton, 
but nobody had joined the Marine Corps, I think, for a couple years. So I just I was intrigued by 
doing something totally different. Uh and everyone was like, "What are you doing? What why are you 
joining the Marine Corps?" I also wasn't, you know, this may shock you to learn Jordan. I wasn't 
like an athletic stud or anything, you know, I was very much a bookish nerd my whole life. And 
so it took a lot of time for me to develop like literally develop the muscles necessary to join 
the Marine Corps. And so I don't know that there was like this circuitous path would be the short 
answer to this question from 9/11 to my own like small small small small role in fighting uh what 
became the global war on terrorism and and being a small small small part of our country's response. 
And I'm I'm happy to unpack that further. But the final thing I'd say is like it was absolutely, you 
know, besides marrying my wife, the best decision I've ever made in my life. It was just the Marine 
Corps, particularly for someone who didn't know anything about the military, wasn't an ROTC. The 
way the Marine Corps has officer can candidate school structured like it is a it gives you this 
opportunity to kind of figure out if you want to do it. And then like there I I really thought 
about there there's no other domain in life where as a 21-year-old right out of college I could be 
in charge of 40 people and be thrust into this super demanding challenging uh environment. And I 
wanted that combination of like a physical test, an intellectual test, a moral test. And it was 
awesome. I loved it. I absolutely I love the point. I think the weirdest thing for people to 
understand like you know at that age when you're young you think you're invincible. And so like 
you have no you're not encumbered by anything like I wanted to deploy like I like volunteered 
for deployment so I'll shut up there. I've talked too much. No no it's I I'm wondering I mean you 
you pointed to when you joined the Marine Corps which was really as things were breaking down 
in Iraq and the strategy that we came to Iraq with was not the strategy that we needed to to to 
succeed and and ultimately be able to to disengage from the height of the war. And I'm wondering 
you and we we might all be familiar with how that conversation played out in Washington, but you 
were really on the front lines of the ingenuity that was required to solve for that problem. And 
I'm wondering what it was like for you to deploy in the middle of this crisis as things were really 
breaking down and be a part of the the shift in the American strategy toward a more successful 
strategy that allowed us to stabilize the country and and save a lot of lives. How did that happen 
from from your perspective being in the Marines? Well, I would say two big things. One, well, one, 
prior to deploying, I kind of had this naive, quicksotic, or even arrogant idea that 
because I spoke the language and I like, you know, was a good student that I was going 
to be like a modern-day TE Lawrence and like, you know, uniquely bridge the gap between the 
Marine Corps and like Onbari tribal shakes and things like that. Uh, I was quickly disabused at 
that notion. Um and I think I think there was I had a very like simplistic understanding of the 
region and even the the we the Marines were trying to educate themselves at the time the you know 
the commun reading list started to include all these books about counterinsurgency even included 
T. Lawrence's memoir um seven pillars of wisdom and some of these books like the Arab mind which 
now in retrospect seem totally ridiculous and like didn't really teach me anything about like the 
specific micro geography of the specific part of Iraq that I went to which was totally different 
than what was happening in Baghdad and let alone in like northern or southern Iraq. Uh so I had to 
do a lot of learning on the ground but I also got to see it firsthand. And I got to actually see our 
strategy succeed because I did two back-to-back deployments. And in the early part of one of my 
deployments, you know, the the the surge kind of happened in Western Iraq and Ambar Province where 
the Marine Corps was prior to it happening in the rest of the country. And so we went from 
at the beginning of one of my deployments, a group of al-Qaeda and Iraq operatives crossing 
the Syrian border dressed in stolen Iraqi army uniforms and slaughtering like 50 people in the 
local village and creating a ton of mayhem to by the end of my deployment, we were, you know, we 
were mostly focused on economic issues and we were targeting oil smugglers and we were, you know, we 
felt very comfortable walking around the streets uh in some cases without personal protective 
equipment. And it was just a remarkable change. I mean, absolutely remarkable change. And 
so I kind of got to see the the fruits of our counterinsurgency strategy, particularly as it 
was perfected by General Petraeus and a few others play out firsthand and kind of see all these 
fence sitters in the local tribal hierarchy, you know, in the Al Mahalawi tribe, the 
Kbouli tribe, etc. go from like, you know, either straddling the fence or actively working 
against us to realizing that America was the strong horse. They should bet on us and help 
us decimate or actually completely destroy the lingering al-Qaeda and Iraq network. Now, that's 
not to say we completely destroyed it, but it was I mean the the success of our counterterrorism 
operations and our counterinsurgency operations was something to behold. Now, I will say I think 
in retrospect it does seem clear that all of that did was buy us time or the opportunity for 
Iraqi political figures and power players to forge a durable political uh consensus. And it 
was somewhat bizarre to me when the Syrian civil war emerged a few years later. At one point, I 
think there was like Syrian airplanes bombing the town that I was deployed to, al-Qaeda, 
because there was terrorists there. I'm like, what is going on? I mean, it's just like such 
a fragile uh equilibrium. Um, but uh it was absolutely fascinating. And um I will say like 
the obvious things were true. I mean, you know, you really have to understand the local dynamics. 
You have to be present for deployed. You have to get out of the base. You have to interact with 
the local officials. That was kind of my job. I was a commander of a human intelligence 
exploitation team. And our job was to gather information from human sources in order to get bad 
guys and keep Marines safe. And so, I don't know, it was absolutely fascinating to see the strategy 
kind of work um over the course of one deployment to the next deployment. One of the one of the 
pitfalls in retrospect is that we focus so much on counterinsurgency as a result of Iraq that we 
were a little bit asleep at the wheel as another challenger rose across another part of the world 
in China and that the type of fighting that we needed to do in Iraq made it difficult to focus 
on the re-industrialization that we had kind of given up on in the wake of the cold war and trying 
to reap the the peace dividend in the wake of the cold war. Um, can you talk a little bit about 
what was China doing in the meantime while we were focused in in Iraq and doing the kinds of 
things that you were doing and how did we get to the place where we are today where we seem to be 
behind in in key metrics like ship building or or running a pace with them when you know 20 years 
ago that would have been a very far-fetched idea that America was running a pace of anybody. Well, 
first let me confess how odd it is that people now think I know something about China because I 
chaired the China committee in Congress because most of my career I was an Arabist. I mean I 
that was my that was my background my training and and to kind of like tie it to your question 
your your this question to the previous one the first day of my second deployment I arrived in 
country in route to al-Qaeda which is a town near the Syrian border in Albar province and I met 
uh a Marine who was leaving uh this my first one I remember um and his name was Matt Pinger and 
Matt Pinger had was in my same military occup occupation specialty was the commanding officer 
of what was called HET one the unit I took over uh near the Syrian border and just fascinating 
brilliant guy former journalist you know he had to get an age waiver to join the Marine Corps amazing 
story but I remember talking to him and like even on the his he was leaving country and usually like 
you know when you're about to leave country you're pretty exhausted but Matt still had his like 
boyish grin and enthusiasm for everything but he told me his life story and he was a Mandarin 
linguist, a China specialist. He spent a decade in China. And I remember thinking at the time 
like why like why would someone why would an a an ambitious national security professional 
spend their time focusing on China? Like right China's not here. Exactly. This is where it 
is. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's all the Middle East for time in memorial. We're fighting terrorists, 
you know, like what an idiot. I learned Arabic. I'm smart. Uh but it turns out Matt was right. 
Uh, and I'm not I'm not I wasn't wrong, per se, but uh he saw something I didn't. And you know, 
even when I was a Senate staffer and increasingly um paying attention more to what China was 
doing, Matt was really the source of most of my education. And when I got elected to 
Congress, I made a point of how we had a monthly meeting where, you know, I just I kind of 
went to the Pinger grad school on China. I was an security adviser on the Walker campaign. And then 
I remember Matt would send me these very detailed memos where really he laid out the pattern of of 
facts and and the corresponding strategy response in a way that became the intellectual foundation 
for the Trump administration's approach to China in the first administration. But suffice it 
to say and to directly answer your question, um, you know, while they were that while they 
were sort of publicly while we were inviting China into the global economic order in the hopes 
that it would moderate their political behavior, uh, they were pocketing those concessions, growing 
more repressive internally, aggressive externally, and um, and really with no intent to ever abide 
by the rules-based global order in general or their specific promises that they made as part of 
the session to the WTO in particular. By the way, those aren't the musings of like some Republican 
hawk. I think Rush Doshi would agree with that assessment if you read his book. Uh the long game, 
you know, was always the strategy of, you know, hide your ambitions, b your time. Um and you 
know, this this latent ambition to not only be the dominant country in the Indopacific region, but 
really the dominant country uh in the world. Uh, in fact, you know, while historians will quibble 
over when the new cold war with communist China began, as they continue to to quibble over when 
the old Cold War with the Soviet Union began, you know, a lot of the initial aggressive island 
building efforts and corresponding territorial claims even predated Xiinping. Um, and so I 
think uh I I I think what we're seeing now is an expression or a continuation of a concerted 
strategy that the Chinese Communist Party has had for decades. Uh, and it is a strategy to destroy 
the US-led global order, to displace our position of preeminence, um, and to become the dominant 
country in the world and and along the way sever all our alliances. Yeah. So now that we're in 
2025, this is the this is the big challenge that we confront. How do you think we can close the 
gap with China and the places where we've lost ground and retake the lead? And and specifically, 
what can AI do for our defense industrial base if properly harnessed and implemented? And and I 
guess the the key question here is like why is it so important for humans to be amplified and 
not replaced by artificial intelligence? Well, in order and and maybe in in simplest terms, 
how I think about this is um at a minimum like the pass fail grade for US grand strategy is we 
should not be funding our own destruction. Right? If there's one thing we've learned like in 
the last three decades, it's that, you know, the problem isn't that we didn't engage hard 
enough with China or that we didn't like give them enough access to the global economy. It's 
not like we open one more theme park or have, you know, more American movies in China or another 
American business. Suddenly the commies are going to wake up and think, you know what, we got 
America wrong. Let's change our whole approach. like we should not be allowing US capital and 
intellectual property to flow to China in order to fuel their destructive ambitions, their genocidal 
ambitions internally and their ravantist ambitions externally. uh it is long past time for us to 
put controls on outbound capital flows to China to put sensible limits on their access and and 
on their access to our own intellectual property their presence at American universities and also 
to reestablish some semblance of deterrence in cyerspace so that the greatest transfer of 
human wealth of wealth in human history i.e intellectual property theft from China does not 
continue. Um so that's point one. Uh point two, because we were complacent uh for decades, you're 
right to suggest that the American industrial base uh and defense industrial base in particular has 
become hollowed out. It's become brittle. Um we've gone from having a lot of companies in that space 
to it being concentrated in five defense primes. Increasingly, we're starting to see that change 
due to the efforts here at Palanteer to revitalize ecosystem uh and the the new administration's 
push for a nontraditional defense tech. But still, we're not moving fast enough. So, we have to find 
a way to revitalize American manufacturing. And that's where I think AI has so much promise, 
right? Far from being a threat to American workers, I actually think AI is going to be 
the Iron Man suit that we're able to wrap around every American worker who wants to work, 
bust their butt, allow them to make more money, be incredibly more productive. And the 
fact is, we just, as a matter of strategy, we're not going to beat China if we just try and 
throw more human beings and money at this problem. We have to find a way to fight smarter. And it's 
that American innovative ecosystem leveraging AI software uh cutting edge technology pairing it 
with legacy industries that I think is going to be our opportunity to to um reduce our dependency 
on China in critical areas revitalize our American manufacturing industrial base and also ensure 
that they can't control the commanding heights of critical technology whether it's AI whether 
it's quantum whether it's synthetic biotech take your pick. Because what we've learned in 
recent years is that given dominance in those areas, they will weaponize that dominance, 
right? They're using their dominance in rare earth manufacturing and processing right now to uh 
uh to kind of hold us over the barrel in certain diplomatic negotiations. Um they threatened to cut 
off the export of APIs during the uh coronavirus pandemic to plunge us into a sea of coronairus. 
Imagine if we got into a confrontation over Taiwan with China and they cut off access to critical, 
you know, micro electronics or rare earths or, you know, ingredients for life-saving drugs. Or 
imagine if they weaponized the access that they now have to American crit critical infrastructure 
after the vault and salt typhoon attack. So, I guess all this is a long way of me saying while 
we've paid lip service to the idea that we have an existential competitor in the form of the CCP, and 
while some are willing increasingly to say we're in the early stages of a new cold war, we still 
haven't attacked this problem with the requisite sense of urgency that it demands, as if it were 
an existential threat. And every time I even would say that that this is an existential threat, 
I would get the crap kicked out of me by the Washington Post and all sorts of commentators 
on TV and I'd be called a neoccarthy. But all you have to do is just read what Xiinping says, 
particularly when he's talking to party audiences. Like he has no reservations. when he's not talking 
to the Davos crowd, when he's talking internally, about talking about America as evil, about talking 
about the inevitable decline and demise of the capitalistled order led by America, about saying, 
"I will take Taiwan by force if necessary," he is preparing his country for war, and we still are 
not meeting the moment in order to deter a war. Yeah. On that happy note, I'll stop. Yeah. 
On that happy note, well, actually, well, maybe we'll try to turn to a happy note. through 
your through your work at Palanteer, you've been able to see where the industrial base is picking 
up AI to to sort of speed along and supercharge what it's doing. I'm curious if you can share some 
examples in some of the spaces where where you're active through Palunteer or where workers are 
using AI to free themselves from drudgery so they can build better and faster and get back to the 
thing that they really actually want to be doing, which is building the things that America needs 
to stay strong and to win this fight. Well, where I'm most excited about this, um, and perhaps it's 
because I represented a ship building district, or perhaps it's because, you know, I'm a Marine 
Corps officer, which means I'm a naval officer, which means, you know, I think the Navy Marine 
Corps team is, you know, the most important team that we have. Um, but I think we have a massive 
opportunity to revitalize American ship building right now. The Trump administration has rightly 
placed this as one of their highest priorities. And uh in our work at Paler, we've already started 
to see some of the positive effects that applying actual commercial technology AI enabled software 
to manufacturing can have the transformative effect it can have. For example, at Anderoll, it's 
already delivered a 200fold increase in supply chain responsiveness. That's now accelerating the 
production of unmanned service vessels, which are critical to Indopacific deterrence against China. 
Um, engineers now operate with full situational awareness, when they're sequencing tasks, uh, uh, 
when they're resolving procurement friction, uh, when they're adapting designs in real time. At 
Seronic, another great customer of ours that's helping build a foundation for a fully digitized 
shipyard. So, you're going to have procurement, design, manufacturing unified into a single hyper 
intelligent system where every input is tracked, every decision is contextualized, every risk 
is anticipated. Um, and I think what's going to emerge on the other side of that is an 
industrial shipyard machine with the agility of a startup and the precision of a defense prime. 
And this model, um, powered by Palanter software is already scaling among America's allies. 
So on the Korean Peninsula, for example, HD Hyundai's flagship shipyard is operating at 
a tempo and scale that the United States hasn't matched in decades. South Korea now builds nearly 
30% of the world ships and Chandai alone commands 17% of global output. One yard there delivers 
nearly five times more commercial vessels than the entire US ship building base combined. So 
I think ship ship building for me is just this perfect example of legacy manufacturing that's 
critical to US national security where the the new administration clearly sees it as a priority 
where you're starting to see the non-traditionals and foreign innovators do some some really 
interesting things and if we can just apply that to American shipyards I think we can we 
can produce a quantum leap. One final story to illustrate how absurd the the current situation 
is visav China. I remember going to um a master ship repair yard in Southern California um in 
my first term when I was a freshman member of Congress and they were just talking about how 
they had just built a dry dock, right? Dry dock, big structure you need to repair ships and they 
were telling me and I'm like so where did where did you build it? Like how how did it work? And 
like well we built it in China. So you think about it like we're building dry docks on the west coast 
so that we have more ships to confront China, but we have to we need China to build the things 
necessary to repair those ships. And in order to get it from the Pacific back to the West Coast, 
you have to cut it into three pieces, ship it, weld it back together. And they were like, "Oh 
yeah, we almost couldn't weld it back together because local politics were such that people were 
worried about underwater welders forcing the fish to go deaf in the harbor." And I'm like, "Come 
on, America. we got to get our crap together like this. This is totally absurd. So, you're 
starting to see that change. I think we have an opportunity right now. There's a big way in which 
and I'm curious uh if you've found this in meeting with shipyard workers when you when you've gone 
to visit these sites, there's a big way in which there's so much that we're doing to get in our 
own way. And I find when we when we've been doing these stories for working intelligence, you find 
so many people who just really want to do the work that they signed up for, whether that's treating 
patients or building a product in a factory. And what's happened over the last 25 to 30 years 
is these barnacles of administration and data and emails and spreadsheets just suck the soul out of 
the work. And the real useful applications of AI are taking that stuff off the plate of the humans 
that they can be their fully realized creative selves and and produce at their fullest and and 
really derive pleasure and meaning from their work as opposed to being bogged down in all of this 
all the barnacles that have kind of glombmed on to their jobs. I don't know if you found that in 
the shipyards as well. 100%. Right. Some estimates we've seen is that at at various shipyards, 
people are doing productive work less than 20% of the time. Not through any fault of their 
own, but they're like complying. And I'm sure this is a consequence also of being government 
contractors, right? You have to dealt often with like webs of regulation and bureaucracy, but 
the the consequence is that, you know, people are spending 80% of their day doing mind-numbing, 
soulcrushing work, and nobody wants to be doing that, right? So what AI has the potential to do 
is liberate people from the soul crushing work and allow them to focus on meaningful productive 
work. Um I you know it's interesting I this had just occurred to me now so bear with me. I 
reserve the right to resend the statement. There is a way if you read like what Xiinping is 
talking about, right? He he his spirit animal is Stalin and he talks about like engineering souls, 
right? Like this is sort of the Marxist Leninist ideology that like the party can like engineer the 
souls of all the party members. Like we're sort of at Palunteer doing the exact opposite, right? 
like we're liberating souls from soul crushing work so they can realize their highest potential. 
That's true in ship building. It's true in legacy manufacturing. It's true in any industry that's 
collected the barnacles that you've talked about. And once you do that, I think you're also going 
to start to solve I think the workforce challenges get get much easier to solve. So, for example, one 
thing I I confronted when I was in politics was people paying a lot of lip service to this idea 
that, well, not everybody needs to go to college, right? Let's go into the trades. You can be 
a welder at a shipyard or you can, you know, do XYZ and make money and you can be making 85 
grand a year right out of college and not have college debt. And like, it's all it's all right. 
It's all true. And everybody like was saying the right things. But then I would ask parents saying 
this, I'd say, "Well, what about your kids?" and they'd say like, "Well, I mean, my kids are 
going to go to a four-year college, you know, because there was still this stigma associated 
with the trades." Um, there was still like this people were still playing the status game of 
of four-year colleges. And so I actually think the more that manufacturing and the trades adopt 
cutting edge technology, the sexier it becomes for that 17-year-old or 18-year-old who's weighing, 
okay, I'm interested in working at a shipyard or working in agriculture, but I still feel 
this pressure to go get a four-year degree. Or maybe like my perception of that industry 
is that it's dirty, old school. My dad did it, my grandpa did it. Like I don't know like I what 
what's when you get into these companies that have adopted Palenteer software other cutting 
edge commercial technology it's really exciting to see what like one worker uh can do and I think 
that's going to be attractive to a new generation for whom the value proposition of higher ed is 
changing. You're probably better qualified to opine on that than I am. But I just think at some 
point like if your four-year degree is not getting you like a return on the investment, like you're 
going to look for alternatives. And if we can make it culturally attractive to go into the trades 
because it's technologically advanced, then I think you start to cook with gas. Um because 
every industry I represent in Wisconsin, it really didn't matter. Their biggest challenge for 
really my eight years in Congress was workforce. They just couldn't find enough people to do jobs. 
Like, so if you're willing to work hard out there, like the world is your oyster. Like, there is 
no there is no near-term possibility that AI is going to put you out of a job if you're willing to 
bust your ass because like there is plenty of work to be done. Yeah. I think one of the frustrating 
things about the messaging around AI is that it's going to take everything away from you. You won't 
have to do hard work. And actually, what we found at Palanteer when we've worked with our customers, 
it's actually really high agency enabling, right? It actually takes the most hardworking 
people and gives them all of the autonomy that they would want. And if you're a 17-year-old kid 
and you want to have a major impact, come to a company that's using AI natively and just see your 
star rise, right? Like you can do so much more and not be burdened with all of the administrative 
tasks and not be buried under bureaucracy. It really allows the best ideas to win because 
it allows them to scale at a in a way that we've not seen before quite frankly because you can take 
all that knowledge, combine it with other people's knowledge, and as you said, you're cooking with 
gas. I guess that's a great place to leave it, you know, for for for a last question. You you 
represented a a district in in Congress for seven years. What would you say to the your your former 
constituents or or or anyone else about um workers in in your district who are afraid of losing their 
jobs to AI? Why are you optimistic about American workers leading in AI innovation to strengthen 
our defense and and more broadly to lead in AI in a in a commercial sense as well? Well, I would 
say the only people who should be worried about AI taking their jobs um are people who refuse 
or don't want to learn how to incorporate it into their day-to-day routines. Um and I think the 
great news is that there's a surge of enthusiasm about incorporating AI into into day-to-day 
workflows, particularly in the manufacturing space. When it comes to the trades, as I said 
before, we have a huge shortage of workers. I think we're something like 300,000 welders short 
in the maritime industrial base. 300,000. Like that's a massive amount. That's twice as big as 
the Marine Corps. Uh so we need to recruit more kids to go into the trades. Um so again, if you 
are you willing to work hard and learn new skills, um then I think the world is your oyster. And to 
the point you made, Jordan, yeah, the work could be as hard, if not harder, but it's going to be 
more meaningful, more rewarding intellectually and ultimately financially, allowing people to provide 
for their family, which matters a great deal. Um, I further say that, you know, AI is becoming a 
selling point for manufacturers looking to recruit students into the workforce. Um, I actually think 
like the next generation is going to discover use cases for AI and traditional industry that we 
can't even imagine right now. I even started to see it like, you know, in the district 
I represented is a huge dairy uh district, right? We there are some counties where there are 
more cows than than human beings. Um, you know, I think like your your traditional conception of 
the dairy industry is like, well, okay, you know, a mom and pop dairy, 50 cows, like eat a lot 
of manual labor, like, well, actually, you go on some of these farms and you start to discover 
it's highly automated. It's highly technologically advanced. I mean, there's like robotic milking. 
There's drones that they use to like test the soil. If you care, you know, if you're a 
conservationist, there's all sorts of ways you can use digesttors and dewatering to, you know, 
deal with uh nutrients that come from cows and things like that. So, it actually ends up being a 
pretty technologically advanced industry. Uh even, you know, milk and cows can be exciting for the 
next generation. So, I don't know. This is why I I'm an optimist. I guess the the other reason 
I'm an optimist is um well, two other reasons. want to, you know, working at Palanteer, um, you 
know, as as maybe you and I are the only liberal arts majors at this company, you're surrounded 
by these geniuses from all over the country, super young, and like it keeps me on my toes every 
single day. I think, you know, I was a young I was the one of the youngest members of Congress when I 
got elected, so like I kind of thought I was smart relative to my old peers. Now I just have to like 
keep up every day and to see the problems that are being solved by our engineers, not not by them on 
their own, by the way, but working in partnership with customers in the manufacturing space. I mean, 
it's like magic when you see it happen. Like when you pair a 22-year-old genius computer science 
major from Stanford with like a third generation ship builder in Northeast Wisconsin with all the 
tribal knowledge, like it is like lightning in a bottle. That makes me an optimist. And you 
know, finally thing I'd say at the risk of being corn corny is like America has demonstrated 
a remarkable capacity for for course correction, for reinvention, for innovation. So as much as I 
spent the last, you know, near decade in Congress warning about the China threat, I still would 
bet on America 10 times out of 10. You know, I think we have all the advantages and we have 
a righteous cause. I mean, we're the good guys and we're facing off against the bad guys. And I 
think, you know, you're seeing a wave of companies which previously wouldn't be willing to work with 
the government and the defense department because they had some moral equivalence after Palanteer 
rushed into the breach and said, you know, we are unabashedly want to help the American war 
fighter. We're seeing a sea change in that in that department. And the more we have America's best 
and brightest who would otherwise be optimizing algorithms for like, you know, social media 
applying their talents to national security, the more optimistic I become. Yeah. I no better note 
to end on. And the only thing I'll add to that in addition to being around the magic of Palunteer is 
being around the magic of the people that we work with and seeing past the headlines on AI which 
are often very depressing or assuming that we're going to either get killed or have our jobs be 
killed away and seeing people who have been in the trades for 20, 30, 40 years in some cases, people 
who work on factory plants just ignore the noise and use a new tool that's available to them and 
achieve something they never thought was possible. So it's a it's an exciting time. Hopefully we can 
have people focus on on the good and and drive in that direction. And Mike, really thank you for 
joining us. Really glad to have you on working intelligence and and thank you for the work that 
you're doing to bring AI to the American worker. Much appreciated. It's an honor. I've never been 
accused of being intelligent, but nonetheless, you got half the Yeah, I like working even if 
I'm not intelligent. There we go. Thanks a lot. [Music]
