TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Thank you for all your support. We have a lot of fans in Japan and really good partnership. And looking forward to meeting you guys in the next year when I can come to Tokyo. I'm very proud of the work we've done together. Since 2016, SOMPO has committed to our corporate purpose of building theme park for security, health and well-being. It was in 2018 when I met with Palantir for the first time. We've been striving to be a company that can contribute to a better world and people's happiness. So when I ran across Palantir, I thought, this is it. SOMPO can deliver societal transformation through the L-Data analysis and insights. We started with SOMPO CARE, our nursing care business, and used Palantir Foundry to organize and analyze real data to increase business efficiency and quality of care. We expect that in 2022, our real data platform initiatives with Palantir will deliver major milestones. I wish for everyone to take time to be with their loved ones during this holiday season and special thanks to health and nursing care providers around the world providing critical support for us.
