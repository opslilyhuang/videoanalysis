TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Good morning, everyone. My name is Tara Mycinger and I want to share with you all today how Panasonic Energy is conquering tribal knowledge with the help of our friends here at Palantir. Panasonic Energy or Pena, manufacturers millions of lithium ion batteries every day for the EV industry out of our factory in Reno, Nevada. I started at Pena in 2018 with the battery engineering department before making my way over to my current role. Now I'm a senior manager for maintenance where I oversee about 75% of our equipment repairs and I'm responsible for approximately 350 maintenance technicians or MTs as we call them. Now if I ask you to tell me what comes to mind when you think of Reno, I don't think you're going to tell me a factory or manufacturing. Many of our MTs come from other industries such as entertainment, tourism, or distribution. So it's up to us to teach them a new skill set. So let's for a moment pretend we're a brand new technician in our winding process where the anode cathode and separator come together to begin forming the battery. As much as I'd love to show you a real winder, my bosses are here today. So we're going to have to use our imaginations and actually the generator out back. In this demo, we're going to use mixed reality to showcase how our ontology can be leveraged to upskill a technician to solve harder problems faster. So we walk up to this winder with our trainer. It's clearly not working and we need to find the root cause. We have hundreds of machines like this owner production floor, each with tens of thousands of moving parts. Now the benefit of being a state of the art factory is our machines output a ton of data. So much so that we ultimately don't have the ability to analyze or digest it all on our own. Excel spreadsheets just look at it and laugh. If we look at the machine data, we can see thousands of error codes on this machine and the trainer lets you know there could be multiple fixes for every error. Only some of the solutions are written down. The rest we're going have to learn on the job. Sounds familiar right? Years ago when I started fixing these machines, it took me three to six months to feel comfortable finding solutions for even the most basic recurring issues. So I can tell you from experience, this is completely overwhelming. Now that I'm in leadership, the question for me becomes how can I speed up this learning process? How can I empower an M.T. to feel confident in such an overwhelming situation and ultimately set them up for success at our company? Ask Adam or Adam as we call it uses AIP in our ontology to serve as a co-pilot for the technician. Adam can take a maintenance work order and link it to a wealth of information, both official and unofficial and make suggestions about what an M.T. should try to resolve a problem. So let's try to troubleshoot this machine. As we walk around, we can see that there's a flashing red sensor indicating that it's a cause for the error. Adam will then take that sensor data and start building out its recommendations. Before Adam, an M.T. would have to search a variety of databases and manually piece together relevant information, which is a huge waste of time when you have a down machine right in front of you. Now at their fingertips, M.T.s can see work that was previously done on this winder, the spare parts that were replaced, and the results of any quality investigations that took place recently. We have over a million tickets in our system full of tribal knowledge. Adam can read all of these comments that M.T.s put in and summarize in the order from easiest to hardest suggestions for how a technician should press forward. Finally, Adam can search our library of control documents and only surface relevant instructions for the problem at hand. So you can see here we just learned from Adam that all we had to do was replace that switch and now our machine is back to making batteries. As the last step, the technician will record their fix and it is indexed back within the Adam system, enabling the platform to become smarter and more robust as time goes on. Ask Adam's driving uptime on our equipment by providing information to empower technicians to get to the correct solution as quickly as possible. It also serves as a vital training tool for our new or even veteran technicians who are confused on how to proceed with troubleshooting, cutting that three to six month learning curve that I mentioned earlier down to just a few weeks. Now what I showed in this demo is just the start from Adam. Everything we do in version one will enable us to build out more features in version two, what we're talking about features like smart PM scheduling, which will enable us to go from a preventative maintenance to a proactive maintenance state and start to answer the questions not only what's going to break today, but what's going to break tomorrow? What's going to hold us back in a week or even a month? We're also considering automated spare parts management to be able to feed the technicians the parts that they need when they need them at a low cost. Looking even further into the future with our continuing partnership with Palantir, we're building Adam as a gift for a future sister plant in DeSoto, Kansas. With Adam, the Kansas MTs will also be able to tap into all the experience and tribal knowledge that we've gained over here in Nevada and deploy immediately halfway across the country. I want to thank the Palantir team again for making all of this possible for us. I've been turning over this idea in my mind for years, but to see it come to life quickly and positively affect my technicians has been more rewarding than I can say. This is truly been one of the most extraordinary projects of my career and I'm very grateful to be invited here to share it with you all today. Thank you.
