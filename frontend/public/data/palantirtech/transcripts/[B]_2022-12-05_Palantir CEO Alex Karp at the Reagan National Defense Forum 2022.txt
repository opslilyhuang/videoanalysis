TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Before February 24th, I think the narrative among our adversaries, and certainly even among some of our allies, and when I've talked to them a lot of our business outside of America, was something like, well, you in America, you love liberty, you produce great films, but in fact, the adversaries are as good as you are on military, and they're willing to do things you're not. And I think the February 24th and what's happening in the Ukraine, involving technology in ways we can some can't really talk about always in public, has changed the narrative around war and America too. It's the liberty-loving, tech building people of the West especially of America who produce products or a social period that the non-freedom-loving people need to shiver a little more than they have in the past. And this is crucial for the West and all of our allies who primarily love the freedoms and liberties we have to show that our adversaries, that in fact we are superior at modern warfare, which I would define as tech-enhanced, kinetic attack weapons. So software-enhanced, the software, the fact that software is eating the world is horrifically important for businesses, we most of our businesses in the private sector, but it particularly advantageous for America because America is the best at building software. And the fact that we can build weapons, software-enhanced weapons that really make our adversaries quiver as Senator Graham said more in a more articulate way than I could, that prevents war. And now what does that mean for the tech sector? You know, you're seeing a lot of tech companies who once thought the way to support the US military was the first-hand technology to our adversaries and then, and this is shifted. There's more of a unity of we are going to support the US government, not just crazy palatir and they're crazy, bachic, crazy CEO. It's like we are going to support the US government. And this is crucial. It's like we have the resources in this country. We often have not used them to support our war fighters, and that's changed. And in great part because our adversaries are clearly just worthy of getting kicked in the fanny. A technical term. The thing is, there's, there's, in philosophy of a, kind of, some of you have dynamics, they're kind of auto-poetic, meaning they self-actualized. There's a lot of your questions are what should we ought to do, but in reality, American business has decoupled from China. And I would say the dynamic in this country is very much one of skepticism, and that is going to affect our policies. And I believe, writer, you know, you can argue about what should happen, but what will happen is a decoupling. Now, again, I don't, I'm not saying that's what one should want, but if you look at the pressures on business, the pressures on military, the pressures on polity, Americans, by and large support this. And then, again, in American business, currently, five, six years ago, there was a lot of people, a lot of industries that thought they were going to export to China and America. But there still are some very few. And so that's just going to have a very different dynamic on the future. And again, I would, I would disambiguate, is an odd. I think that is what's going to happen. So let me, let me stay with you. One of the notable phenomena in the, in the aftermath of Russia's expanded war in Ukraine was the, the flight of private sector business from Russia. Is that merely reflect the coercive power of sanctions, or is there something else happening here? Are choices, are different choices, value choices being made by the private sector? Well, again, we, of course, didn't have to flee Russia. We were never there. So, but so I think, honestly, I think good moral choices will lead to good business choices. But I think what really is going to hurt Russia over the long haul is just, there's, in my business, you need the best of the best of the best of the best. And they do not want to work in a country that is invading their neighbor and committing atrocious atrocities. And it's not, the GDP in Russia is just not one that most international businesses are particularly focused on. That's different than China, obviously. Although I'd say that's more European businesses, what, what will really mess up your ability to build complicated technical systems is, and inability to explain to people, what, what, what is good about my country? And again, it doesn't have to, and so, and I think that's why people fled. And I don't think they're going to go back very quickly. And that's not actually about the capital market, it's about the moral market. Is it, especially incumbent on America's high tech partners to make a choice about where they're doing this? I think it is an indisputable fact that there are certain things, software platforms, that are disruptive in America is the focal point of building. And there are other countries that are really quite strong. There are some strong companies in France. It is absolutely essential that we make decisions that are long term in, in unison with the countries that allowed us to grow, in this case for most of us, the US, the United States of America. And I don't think it's, we should be allowed to just say, oh, we got rich here. We are the wealthiest, most powerful people in the world, but we don't support the United States of America. And why? Because you see in the Ukraine and you will see in other places that the products we build actually sway the world to our direction. Not as a matter of theory, not as a matter of rhetoric, but a matter of fact. And that's why I think we have a higher level of responsibility.
