TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

We confirmed that we really do share similar value or similar vision. We really want to help the world shape. So we are the largest shipholder in the world and definitely we want to keep our digital leadership in every aspect. Not only you guys becoming our family members and the world together, at the same time you guys create a sort of kind of need to transform and change. We've made a lot of progress since my visit to Korea. I think that has a lot to do with the people on your end in the room. We had to prove that the software would actually be valuable for you. There were skeptics at the beginning, but we're very…we see the skeptics because when we see skeptics, we see people that have their brains turned on, that aren't fine, hype or shelf wear or things that a lot in software and AI data is doesn't add up to much. We have a rigorous engineering based environment that is warm but skeptical and says, prove it. The things that we've learned about the degrees of complexity and the relationship, just the amount of expertise, and real genius involved. And that's what we're very excited to be together. Also being very rigorous about having a discreet objective. This is the thing that needs to get better and this is the thing that if it is better than business is better. Our goal is total refinery optimization, but we're going to start with this one very specific piece of equipment. What really impressed me as Hong-Pi and K-SUN was that we got the kind of no-bure glues from rank 5 and operator people that, hey, I thought that data is a someone else's business but I hate it. It helps me. You know, we all feel that this is the beginning. I'm looking forward to seeing you guys. I believe we will do really interesting things together. We're on the path and we're wildly enthusiastic.
