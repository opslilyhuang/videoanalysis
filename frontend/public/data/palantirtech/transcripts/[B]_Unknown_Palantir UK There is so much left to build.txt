TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

I joined our NHS deployment and we just finished a successful pilot with Chelsea and Westminster Trust. We were able to reduce the impatient weightless by 28%. And we were given the task of to take that solution and to deploy it to 30 trusts across England. I worked six months in the job and I worked on six different projects for six different government clients in six different countries. My very first deployment was with Ferrari and specifically Scuderia Ferrari, which is the Formula One team. And the first race of the season is in Australia, but we won. I say we, they, but we felt like part of it. I was recently on a project with Airbus to build out a solution that helps them build more planes per year. I'm actually knocking out something that will help transform our pandemic response. That was by far the most incredible project I got to lead in my career. So Panty, we have really small lean teams and that allows us to have a huge amount of responsibilities. It's a creative ground where you get to just apply your best efforts, fail gloriously, learn from it, try again, make stuff happen. Definitely being a four deployed software engineer and then using your technical skills to then solve a problem. You really just see a problem and solve it right away without thinking twice or asking for permission. I think Panty is the only place where you can do the depth of engineering but then also have rapid impact and the high velocity of working over a weekend with like your friends and teammates to like get something really important done. I get to work with customers and then I also get to build the solution. I would honestly say like the growth opportunity that I had with Panty is something that I wouldn't be able to do elsewhere. Take on the things that I think I can do and take them to the next level. There's an incredible pool of people here who are both extremely social but also extremely talented and smart. So if a place where we do a lot of R&D, we're pushing the product to its edge. In fact, I have found that Panty, you're surprisingly to me, is the chatiest company. I have Averbina and will probably ever be it as well. We have product development, we have business development, we have internal teams, we have lawyers, we have all sorts. That creates a wonderful community.
