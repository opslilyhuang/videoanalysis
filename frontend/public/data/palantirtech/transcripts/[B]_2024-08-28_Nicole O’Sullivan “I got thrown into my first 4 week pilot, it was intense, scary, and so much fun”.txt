TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

Hey, I'm Nicole. I grew up in Dublin in Ireland. I lived there for the first 23 years of my life. It was just me and my mom growing up. So I always joke that we were like Gilmore girls because she was like a kind of young cool mom and we were like sisters, which means you know we fought like sisters but also we're like best friends like sisters. We're still best friends. And yeah, so it was me and her group very close. I was kind of wanted to make her really really proud in my life. That was kind of like that's like my main motivation still to this day because so like she didn't finish university for like you know when I was younger or when she had me and then she went back to art college when I was a teenager. But yeah, so like very artsy kind of cool environment. But yeah, I always wanted to make her proud in that way. I'm an only child as well. So yeah. Wow. I mean, I love the series. So I have all kinds of visuals of autumn in Dublin. Exactly. Yeah. And all the characters in the town. So what does your mom do? Yeah, so right now she's actually a mortgage broker. She has just started like in the past year her own mortgage brokerage company in Ireland. So it's super like I'm super happy for her. And but yeah, so she's not an artist basically is the long story. But so yeah, she studied ceramics and art. I think that was because like she went back as a mature student, she really wanted to get her degree because she didn't get it the first time when I was born. So that was kind of her motivation there. But also my whole family are kind of artists as well. So yeah. Wow. Okay. So you're from a family of artists, everyone's in Ireland. How does that influence your career path? Did you study that? Yeah. Yeah. I wish I studied art. I love art. I still do to this day. Really. I'm a bit I'm a pretty good like I really enjoy it. But what I kind of wanted when I was younger, I was like, I want to have a very traditional like career path and I want to make my mom proud. I think that was kind of like I wanted to you know, make money so that you know, she would have money and like so that my like future kids kind of like would have maybe more than like I grew up with or something. So I wanted to be a lawyer. I saw movies and I was like lawyers are you know, they wear fancy suits. They have money. So I'm going to be a lawyer and I make my family proud. So I kind of was like gunning towards that. I studied law at Trinity College for a year, a full year. And I very quickly realized like two months into it that I hated it and that it was so boring. There was nothing at least in my mind. I know some people obviously really enjoy it and find it interesting. But I thought it kind of maybe wasn't as creative as I wanted it to be. I also really enjoyed mathematics, super into kind of problem solving and anything to do with that. So I was really missing that element. So after my first year of law, I switched studying maths and economics. And again, also even though my family were quite artsy as well, my granddad was like an engineer by trade. So he was very like kind of mathsy and like kind of that kind of influence came from him. And same with my mom, she liked maths as well. So I thought that would be a kind of a good option to study. Wow. Very interesting brain. So you have the mathematical side of things as well as the artistic. How did that kind of manifest in your university experience? Were you you know, is it in the library a lot? Were you kind of getting into sort of extra curricula? How did you balance that time? Yeah, I wish I could say that I was in the library a lot. But no, I actually my main extracurricular during university was the competitive debating society. So that was kind of like my main outlet in terms of like extracurriculars, I wasn't sporty at all. And that kind of format there was that like you have a debating partner, you have seven minutes to or sorry, you have 15 minutes to press the seven minute speech each on a topic that you've never heard of. And you don't have any access to internet or anything like that. And that was super fun to me because it was like problem solving on the fly, but also having to communicate it in a persuasive way that makes people want to agree with you. And that was just like fascinating to me. So I was like going to tournaments like at different universities, mostly like every weekend, and like I went to the European Championships and the World Championships as well. And that like amazing time, super super fun. I mean that was very competitive then. So it's not as though you were low leagues of debating. This is the highest echelons of debate club that exist. Yeah, I mean like yeah, the European Championships were pretty fun. I did well at those as like more so as a judge than a speaker because I think I kind of enjoyed the judging of debate more. But yeah, it was very competitive. Everyone there is like super motivated, super cool. You have people from like really like top tier universities like and they're all super like wicked smart. Like it was a great environment I think to be in like to grow in as well as like a young person just to kind of be like, oh like what kind of opportunities exist out there? Like like you know, I think that was my main thing. It was like, you know, there's a lot of really great people here with great career paths and like they're going to be go in places. And then also the communication aspect of it as well, learning how to articulate myself and actually like give a good argument. It was like a big thing. Well, okay, so you're exposed to all of these other bright and brilliant people with interesting career paths. Did that kind of inform what you did after university? Yeah, kind of. I think that like it, like it definitely made me realize that I really enjoy like kind of communication in a way or like words and like language. I already knew that I really like languages. I studied a lot of languages in secondary school. I like we studied Irish in Ireland. So that was one I did Italian and then also Japanese. And I was very interested in like the intersection between like mathematics and then communication and argumentation. And I actually found that like in my last few years of university, as we got more into like, you know, a little bit of data analysis or like econometrics and statistics and things like that, I was like, wow, I really like kind of like coding or like a little bit of like, you know, like tech, anything kind of communicating with computers is super interesting because it's like a weird intersection of like mathematical equations and then also like words and like language and how to speak. And then also fundamentally, I wanted to do a job that involved problem solving, which was like going back to the maths and debating as well. And it was like, I just knew that that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to spend my day thinking about problems and thinking of solutions to them, creative solutions. And then having to kind of persuade someone of those solutions at the end of it is also like a really fun thing for me to do. And that's where I was kind of looking towards. Great. And so then you know what you're looking for and a very articulate description of that. I must say for someone out of school, what was the first job? Did you come straight to Pounder? What did you do? Yeah, so I didn't go straight to Pounder. I my first job out of university. So firstly, I was kind of looking at like loads of random things. I was looking at sales, I was looking at like recruiting at one point, but looking back, I'm like, I don't think that would have worked because there's no problem. Well, there is problem solving, but it wasn't my type of like maxi problem solving I was looking for. And I was kind of trying loads of different things. I was seeing what was out there. I landed on a data analytics role at a data analytics consultancy in London. And I stayed there for about nine months, like nine, yeah, nine-ish months before I came to Pounder. But that job was like fully remote. It was like I didn't get to meet anyone. It was very small companies. So there weren't really any opportunities for like ownership or like growth path. Like I got asked from my line manager. I did those tasks. Sometimes it weren't even enough tasks to fill a day, but like that was kind of it. And I was looking for something new and then my debate partner, my my previous debate partner, who I went to the world, the European Championships with, he worked at Palantir. So he is a Smith here at Palantir. And he was like, you know, we're hiring for echoes and deltas. And like you be a good fit. So yeah, he kind of, you know, took me in for dinner. And I saw the offices and I was like, what are this places? Great. So yeah, I applied. So here you are, living in London, you're doing a job that maybe isn't really that fulfilling. You've heard about this place, your mate works here. What's the interview process like? Yeah. So yeah. So he kind of gave me a bit of a rundown of like, you know, here's what Palantir is. And I hadn't heard of Palantir before. But he sounded like he enjoyed it and he enjoyed the vibe. So yeah, I applied initially as a delta, which like it was like in hindsight, that makes no sense. Like I'm not that technical. But I thought it would be fun. Like I kind of I don't I didn't really know what I was looking for. So I applied there. And then on the first phone screen, the interview was like you probably would fit the echo a little bit more. And I was like, okay, that sounds great. So phone screen. And then I think it was like three rounds or like four more like interviews with people, maybe even like five. It was all such a blur. But like I do remember, I really enjoyed the decombed interviews. And I still remember every single one of the decombed questions that I got because they were really, really fun. And like I really enjoyed like the interviews I had with people. I did prep a lot. I was like obviously super nervous and like super like really wanting to get it. Because I think I slowly realized throughout the interview process that I was like, this is such a cool place to be. And I really want to be here. And just the and that kind of signal I was getting from the interviewers as well about like, you know, when I was asking them questions about how they like to work here. I was like, yeah, this place is awesome. And that's kind of how it went. And then I think in my last interview, I also had a surprise decombed session. Like the interviewer was like, oh, let's actually just do a decombed. And I was like, okay, like it was kind of like unplanned. But again, it was super fun. And I was like, this is great. Like it's just like having a chat with your friend or like a debating thing when you're just like, let's try and like, you know, you know, win this thing or let's try and like solve this little thing together. Like it's, I thought it was great. Yeah. What does it look like when you actually get here? How much does that reality match up with your expectation before? Yeah, I think that it it very much matched up. So obviously after the two weeks of like, there were two weeks of onboarding, that was great meeting people. And it was very clear to me, first of all, that everyone here is super motivated. Like everyone is like super highly qualified. And like everyone's smart and like, willing to kind of just like go app things. And that was like clear to me and even just like in the first two weeks, which was amazing. I was instantly like, wow, these are like people I would have surround myself with. And then after the two weeks of onboarding, I got thrown into my first project, which was a four week pilot, which was very intense. And I was like, trying to sell Foundry, having been there, like, you know, all of two weeks. And that was just for onboarding. Like, you know, it was really intense, but it was a really huge and steeply learning curve. And it was so much fun. And I had to go like on-site. I was giving demos in like my third week or something. And it was like super scary, but really fun. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we've heard a bit about your background Nicole, which I think speaks volumes to the fact that you're not a person who shies away from a challenge. But sometimes, you know, I felt my experience coming here was similar to going from one university to another or something. It's a different kind of group of people. And you mentioned that getting here and looking around everyone was interesting. Everyone was very qualified. Can you talk a bit about what that experience can be like, particularly as you're finding your feet and your newer? Yeah, I think it's so, it's pretty scary. And I think that like even now after two years, I often feel as if I as I did when I first joined, which was like, oh my god, like why am I here? Which is like kind of, I feel like when you're surrounded by so many amazing people, it is really hard to be like, I'm also amazing too. Because like it's kind of like when you're comparing yourself to a whole group of people, obviously everyone is going to have like, you know, all the characteristics. And instead of looking at people like individually, but if you look at them as a group, so it's like, why don't I have all those characteristics? Or why can't I do all of these things that all of these people are able to do? Or like why can't I have all the same like hobbies or interesting, you know, topics with conversation and things as everyone else does? But yeah, it's it's scary, I think. And like, I think there's definitely an element of like, I don't know, like kind of like not like paranoid about it, but like scared, scared, I'm like, I am very like still scared like every day, like, oh my god, like is today the day I'm going to mess up? And like, you know, they're going to be like actually to go like, like your time of fountain two is finished or something like, I'm like, definitely still very scared of that. And I think it kind of is just because like the environment that it's in is like competitive in a way. Everyone's super good. Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? I often think about at least my journey at Palantir has been sort of an excavation of self because you're always interacting with so many people who are the best at what they do. I threw that process, you can learn something about yourself. I thought I was at some point I thought was good operationally. And then I met the people who were really good at that. And it's a humbling experience, but it's it's a good one. I think it's a sort of rapid self discovery in a way. Yeah, I totally agree with that. I feel like I've grown more in the past two years of Palantir than I did like at university or like, you know, even like, you know, in school and things like that because I think I'm really learning like really and truly what I am good at. And like, you know, not just like kind of, I don't know, not just like trying different things, but actually just like implementing different things. And like actually like carrying out things to the end and figuring out what I am better at in terms of like, you know, self discovery and like professional and like personal as well. And I think that like what I've tried to do as well is like take that kind of like paranoia slash like, you know, imposter syndrome or whatever, like you want to call it to like just motivate me. And I'm like, okay, well, if today like I'm super nervous about, you know, my job or like I'm super nervous about like, you know, my work or maybe I don't think it's good enough or something. Well, then I'll just make it good enough. Like, I'll just work, yeah, I'll just work really hard. And I'll just like make sure that that kind of goes away rather than kind of like being nervous about it. It's like just turning it into that kind of motivation of, well, I'll just do it then. Like, you know, I'll just, I'll just go to do it. So, yeah. Yeah, that really resonates. And it reminds me of something you said before about kind of ownership. And I think the one of the things that I hear a lot of people talk about here is that kind of intense level of ownership forces you sometimes to out of that imposter syndrome or, oh, I'm not the perfect person to do this, this person who's much better at doing this, this person who's much better at doing that. And sometimes it's only you. You're on the front lines. You mentioned, you're thrown into this pilot, you're up to bat for the company. So your best job is the best job we have to offer. And I'm curious if you can talk a bit about that feeling and working through it to bias towards action. And I think specifically, I, you know, I've, I have observed you from afar crushing it. So turning out these very creative things on some of the AIP now projects. So I'm curious to hear a bit more about what that experience was like most recently and how you've been creative kind of in this very new space. Yeah, I think, I think it goes back to like exactly what you said about like even if you are nervous about like a why am I here, why am I owning this thing? It's like, well, like obviously I'm just owning it and like someone's going to have to do it. I can't like, you know, I'm not going to be able to turn around in a few months and be like, oh, sorry, I was nervous about that thing. That's why I didn't do it so well. Like, you know, it's kind of like you just, you just got to do it. And I think that's kind of the attitude I've been taking with like some of the new stuff that I've been like kind of owning over the past number of months with like AIP or even just in like an impol work. It's definitely like a higher level, the highest level of ownership of like anything that I've ever had in probably my professional career and also personal. And it's like, you just kind of got it just like get into like a battle mindset about it and just be like, well, that's just charge out and let's just do it because no one else is doing like no one else is going to do it and no like I can't really just like, you know, turn around and say sorry at the end like I just got it like I want to do something that makes myself proud. And I think like for me, whenever I'm like taking on something new, I always try and like picture myself at the end of it. So like say if I'm like starting like a new like pilot or project, I'm always like, okay, I just want to picture myself at the very end of this project. How do I want to feel when the steer goes over or like I want to make sure that that feeling happens or like the feeling of happiness or excitement? And then I'm like, they're like the worst thing that can happen is if it goes like badly or something. So I'll just like continually like check in with my future self and make sure that I'm making her, I'm going to be making her feel the things I want her to feel if that makes sense. Yeah, that certainly does, you know, you're your own worst enemy but also own best champion to push us off forward. Okay, so I've kept you for long enough, I think you have a steer code this morning. One sort of closing one I suppose, there's lots of reasons that kind of brought you here. It seems like there's lots of reasons you stay. If you had to bring it down to one reason you're trying to convince a friend to join or something, what would it be for you now? I think it would be the people and I think it's precisely the reasons I kind of have already said like in terms of people are so good and it's so motivating. Like if everyone else around me is so stellar and I am an actually competitive person and I'm like, okay, what if everyone around me is stellar, I want to be a super stellar. So it's kind of like, you know, I like that motivates me and that makes me want to keep coming in and like doing the fun work. Like the work is I love the work as well. Like it's super fun. Like my dream job. But like I think it's the it comes down to the people because that's what actually keeps me motivated and like being inspired by so many great amazing people to work with. Like I love impact review season because I can't wait just to tell everyone how great they are. Like everyone is so cool. Like and so motivating and so inspiring and so smart and it really just makes me want to be a better person both professionally and personally in a lot of aspects too.
